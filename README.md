Dear Dan,

We are good to go!  Please have a look:
    http://www.headstar.com/eab/~new/

I've updated the news page.  Let me know of any edits or serious issues - and let me know if I should replace the
current site (http://www.headstar.com/eab).

There may be minor bugs that can be fixed after the relaunch, and I've invited user feedback.

I'll phone in a bit. Regards,

Nick
