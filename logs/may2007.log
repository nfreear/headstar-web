  03: Voice Technology Helps Pilot Complete Record Breaking Flight.Voice technology has helped blind adventurer Miles Hilton-Barber set
a new record by flying a microlight aircraft from Biggin Hill in
England to Sydney in Australia. The flight, which followed the route of
an air race staged in 1919, aims to raise 1 million pounds to help the
fight against preventable blindness in developing countries.
Hilton-Barber navigated the 13,500 miles over 21 countries using
instruments specially adapted to deliver voice output of the aircraft's
altitude, direction, and wind speed. He entered the readings into an
onboard computer using a wireless keyboard strapped to his leg.
He was accompanied by a sighted co-pilot, who was responsible for
speaking to control towers and providing back-up in case of an
emergency. The journey began on March 7 and took 55 days to
complete, requiring the pilots to deal with extreme weather conditions
such as heavy snow in the mountains of Lebanon, and tropical
rainstorms.
The flight will raise funds for Seeing Is Believing
( <a href="http://www.seeingisbelieving.org.uk/">http://www.seeingisbelieving.org.uk/</a>
 ),a project run by Standard Chartered Bank to promote treatment of eye
cataracts in Asia and Africa.
