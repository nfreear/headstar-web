Character codes for UTF-8 must be in the range: U+0000 to U+10FFFF.
The definition of UTF-8 in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 also
allows for the use of five- and six-byte sequences to encode
characters that are outside the range of the Unicode character set;
those five- and six-byte sequences are illegal for the use of
UTF-8 as a transformation of Unicode characters. ISO/IEC 10646
does not allow mapping of unpaired surrogates, nor U+FFFE and U+FFFF
(but it does allow other noncharacters). For more information please refer to
http://www.unicode.org/unicode and http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
