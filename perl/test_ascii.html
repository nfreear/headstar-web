<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Special Notice: Sight Village 2004- 13-15 July, Birmingham, Uk.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>
<p> 
 Around 3,000 people are expected to visit this year's QAC Sight
 Village, the exhibition for everyone with an interest in technology and
 services connected to visual impairment. Exhibitors and visitors come
 from throughout the UK, America, Canada, Europe, the Middle East
 and Africa. Smaller organisations of or for people with visual
 impairment are particularly welcomed as exhibitors alongside the 'big
 players'.
</p>
<p> 
 This year the event has moved to a larger venue: the Clarendon Suites,
 a conference centre near to the exhibition's host Queen Alexandra
 College. All areas of the venue are accessible for wheelchairs, and
 admission is free. See:

<h3 id="i54-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Europe Launches Major Access Programme</h3>
<p> 
 The European Commission has launched a major new programme of
 research into accessibility policies across EU member states, paving
 the way for a set of accessibility guidelines to improve access to digital
 services and technologies for disabled users across the continent.
</p>
<p> 
 The <a href="mailto:eInclusion@eu">eInclusion@eu</a> project (http://www.einclusion-eu.org/) will examine national and regional policies on access to employment,
 public sector technology procurement, and access to online public
 services such as e-government, e-health and e-learning. As part of its
 work the 30-month project aims to build an EU-wide picture of
 accessibility requirements for government web sites, including which
 accessibility standards are used, if compliance is voluntary or
 mandatory, and whether feedback from users is collected and acted on.
</p>
<p> 
 Lutz Kubitschke of German consultancy Empirica
 (<a href="http://www.empirica.com/">http://www.empirica.com/</a>
), which is co-ordinating the research, told E-Access Bulletin: "It is important to get a structured view of what is
 going on out there. It's no good if guidelines are issued in Brussels, but
 they are not practical for member states to implement." It is hoped that
 by the end of the year, the Commission will use the research to issue
 draft guidelines on public procurement, Kubitschke said.
</p>
<p> 
 The findings should also uncover valuable information such as
 problems with implementing international web accessibility standards.
 "In some cases it may be that the expertise needed to translate
 guidelines such as WAI (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
) into procedures is missing, or that not enough money, time and resources are made
 available for accessible web design," said Kubitschke. The
 <a href="mailto:eInclusion@eu">eInclusion@eu</a> project is being driven by a core of research teams in eight member states, and is funded through the EU's 17.5 billion euro
 Sixth Framework research programme
 (<a href="http://fp6.cordis.lu/fp6/home.cfm">http://fp6.cordis.lu/fp6/home.cfm</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i54-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Banks Named And Shamed Over Card Problems</h3>
<p> 
 UK banks who fared poorly in a 'mystery shopping' exercise to test the
 accessibility of new-style credit and debit cards are to be "named and
 shamed" by the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The cards tested use a new so-called 'Chip and PIN' system designed
 to combat fraud by requiring users to key in a security PIN number
 whenever a purchase is made. Banks are supposed to offer and explain
 an alternative to Chip and PIN called 'Chip and signature', which is
 easier for some people with impaired vision since they may find
 keypads hard to use. However, the survey found that many were not
 doing so.
</p>
<p> 
 Results of the mystery shopping experiment will be published towards
 the end of August and will include full details of which card issuers
 were contacted along with a breakdown of the results.
</p>
<p> 
 When a pool of vision-impaired 'mystery shoppers'
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsit">http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsit</a>

 e/public_mysteryshopping.hcsp) initially contacted the call centres of
 fifteen banks, building societies and credit card companies to ask for
 advice on the accessible alternative, just 22 callers out of the total 67
 calls made (33 per cent) were told about the alternative and 15 call
 centre employees (22 per cent) mentioned that customers could
 continue to sign but either gave incorrect information about the chip
 and signature card or knew nothing about it.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB campaigns team is currently working with banks to improve
 services, for example leading staff through practical issues such as how
 call centre staff can identify when to issue a chip and signature card.
 The RNIB has also suggested banks improve information on their
 intranets and external information on their web sites. "Internal
 communication is the issue," says Helen Dearman, campaigns officer
 at RNIB. Dearman says she has already noticed a reduction in the
 amount of calls to the RNIB from people complaining about their
 banks over this issue, although she adds that a high staff turnover in
 bank call centres is likely to hamper progress when the mystery
 shopper exercise is repeated in August
</p>
<h3 id="i54-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Guidelines For Local Government Chiefs</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB has published guidelines for senior managers and policy-
 makers in local government on how to make new technologies, from
 smart cards to tactile displays, more usable by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Written by Dr John Gill, chief scientist at the RNIB, the 'Access-
 Ability' booklet (<a href="http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/access-ability/">http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/access-ability/</a>
) provides an overview of design considerations to be taken into account
 when developing new services. From transport and financial
 transactions to telecommunications and computing, the publication
 outlines common problems experienced by the elderly and disabled
 and offers suggestions for addressing them.
</p>
<p> 
 "The booklet is targeted at senior managers who aren't specialists in
 technology and don't have in-depth knowledge of disability," says Gill.
 The guidelines were produced as part of the RNIB's collaboration with
 the National Smartcard Project
 (<a href="http://www.nationalsmartcardproject.org.uk/">http://www.nationalsmartcardproject.org.uk/</a>
), one of 22 national projects commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to
 aid local authorities on the road to e-government
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nat1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nat1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The collaboration identified three target audiences who needed more
 information about accessibility: senior managers and policy-makers in
 local government; project leaders responsible for implementing local e-
 government projects; and hardware and software designers who may or
 may not work for local government.
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines were developed in collaboration with Comit&#233; Europ&#233;en
 de Normalisation (CEN - <a href="http://www.cenorm.be/">http://www.cenorm.be/</a>
), the European technology standards body.
