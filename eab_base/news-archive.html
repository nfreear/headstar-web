<h3>+December 2002: EAB sets accessible newsletter standard.</h3>

<p>The publisher of E-Access Bulletin, Headstar, today launches a new draft
 standard for accessible text email newsletters dubbed the TEN Standard.
</p>
<p>Derived from our work on this bulletin over three years, plus feedback from a reader
 survey, the standard covers everything from how to number stories within a newsletter
 to preferred formats for web addresses and ways to divide the newsletter into sections.
</p>

<p>For full details and a copy of the standard visit:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/ten">www.headstar.com/ten</a> .
</p>
<p>We would very much like to receive further feedback on the standard, and to also
 invite individuals or organisations who may find it useful in their work to 'sign up'
 to the standard. This would merely entail letting us know you find it useful and
 endorse it, and also how you may be putting it to use (please email
 <a href="mailto:ten-standard@headstar.com">ten-standard@headstar.com</a>).
