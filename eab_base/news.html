<h3 id="jul2004">+July 2004: Bulletin site redesigned to be accessible.</h3>

<p>Specialist accessibility consultant,
  <em><a href="http://freear.org.uk/" title="formerly, Bunbury Information Services">Nick Freear</a></em>
  has undertaken a major redesign of the E-Access Bulletin Web-site for its
  publisher, <em>Headstar</em>.  The aim of the new site is to improve
  usability for all.
</p>
<p>The site now meets all priority 1, 2, and in most cases, priority 3 of the
  World Wide Web Consortium&#39;s <em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</em>.
  Pages make sense when read in non-visual environments, and key elements of
  the page like the site menu are clearly signposted.
  Users have a choice of graphical or large-text Style sheets for each page, and
  'access-keys' are defined so that users can find the main pages on the site
  using only the keyboard.
</p>
<p>More about the site design can be <a href="site.html#design">found here</a>.
  We welcome feedback on the site &mdash; please
  <a href="contact.html" title="Contact details">contact the editor</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="jun2004">+June 2004: EAB set to revamp accessible newsletter standard.</h3>

<p>The publisher of E-Access Bulletin, <em>Headstar</em>, is set to publish a
  revised version of its standard for accessible text email newsletters, the
  <acronym title="Text Email Newsletter Standard">TEN</acronym> Standard.
</p>
<p>Derived from our work on this bulletin over five years, the Standard covers
  everything from how to number stories within a newsletter to preferred
  formats for web addresses and ways to divide the newsletter into sections.
</p>
<p>For full details and a copy of the standard visit:
  <a href="http://www.headstar.com/ten">www.headstar.com/ten</a> .
</p>
<p>We would very much like to receive further feedback on the standard, and to
  also invite individuals or organisations who may find it useful in their
  work to 'sign up' to the standard. This would merely entail letting us know
  you find it useful and endorse it, and also how you may be putting it to use
  (please email <a href="mailto:ten-standard@headstar.com">ten-standard@headstar.com</a>).
