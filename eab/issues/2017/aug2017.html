<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New App Helps To Combat Poor Customer Service Faced By People Withdisabilities.
</h3>
<p>
 A new app-based system has been launched that aims to “shake up” the
 customer service industry across shops, banks and other venues.
</p>
<p>
 The Welcome app lets people with disabilities tell shops and venues of
 their arrival, so that staff can provide tailored assistance suited to
 their condition.
</p>
<p>
 Designed by assistive technology company Neatebox, the free app is a
 two-way platform between users and customer service teams. Users tell
 staff, via the app, that they will be visiting a venue and flag up useful
 information or specific requirements they have, such as needing
 assistance with a wheelchair or that they will be bringing a guide dog.
</p>
<p>
 GPS tracking lets staff know exactly when the customer arrives, and the
 app also provides links to useful information about various impairments,
 supplied by charities and specialist organisations; the Royal National
 Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Guide Dogs have both provided
 information for the app.
</p>
<p>
 The system only works with venues that have signed-up, but users are
 encouraged to request new venues within the app. Neatebox founder Gavin
 Neate told e-Access Bulletin that a “massive part” of the system is the
 team approaching venues identified by the user community: “I guarantee
 that if someone downloads the app now and requests a venue they would
 like to see using it, we will contact that venue within a week at most,”
 Neate said.
</p>
<p>
 Venues that have signed up so far include Edinburgh Airport, hotels,
 shops, cafes, tourist attractions and the Royal Bank of Scotland, where
 the app has been installed at the company’s headquarters in the hope of
 demonstrating its benefits for more widespread use.
</p>
<p>
 At present, venues are mainly in Scotland, where Neatebox is based, but
 users can request locations anywhere. Requests have been received for
 venues in Northern Ireland, Devon and London, as well as the United
 States, Canada and New Zealand. The app isn’t yet available outside of
 the UK, but this isn’t being ruled out.
</p>
<p>
 Neate said that he believes Welcome can “shake up” customer services.
 “With more and more older people and people with specific needs,
 industries need to seriously look at the service they provide.  Whether
 industries are aware of it or not, they have a whole new world coming
 towards them,” Neate said.
</p>
<p>
 A former guide dog mobility instructor, Neate started Neatebox to help
 find a solution for problems that some of his visually impaired clients
 had when operating pedestrian crossings. This solution became Button, a
 system that allows a user’s mobile phone to automatically ‘push’ buttons
 at pedestrian crossings as they approach, using Bluetooth. This
 simplifies the process for those who may find it difficult to operate the
 crossings – for example, someone who is blind or using a wheelchair.
</p>
<p>
 Crossings need to have simple hardware installed in them for the Button
 system to work, but as with the Welcome app, users can request locations
 and Neatebox will contact requested local authorities. The company is
 already working with some councils to install the technology. The system
 has already been installed throughout the town of Largs, on the West
 Coast of Scotland.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Housing Help Tips, Podcasts And Lifelines For People With Sightloss, Collected Online.
</h3>
<p>
 A new online housing guide for people with sight loss has been launched,
 collecting together existing resources, advice and podcasts to help
 people in a range of situations.
</p>
<p>
 The free guide has been created by sight loss charity Thomas Pocklington
 Trust, as a comprehensive portal for visually impaired people who are
 looking for a new home or experiencing housing issues.
</p>
<p>
 Users are linked to relevant information depending on their circumstances –
 for example, people seeking information on independent living, people
 whose homes need repairs, and those facing homelessness or eviction.
</p>
<p>
 A wide range of topics are covered, including advice on renting and
 buying a home, resources to help with household tasks, local authority
 support, and a housing ‘jargon buster’.
</p>
<p>
 Imogen Blood, co-author of the guide, told e-Access Bulletin that people
 with sight loss face a number of issues around housing. She said: “The
 process of finding housing and moving home can throw up a number of
 practical challenges for a person with sight loss: from getting
 accessible versions of tenancy agreements to thinking about where you
 will exercise your guide dog. Meanwhile there is a lack of clarity around
 whether and how you might be able to access social housing with a visual
 impairment, or use disability benefits to pay a mortgage.”
</p>
<p>
 One section of the guide focuses on technology that can aid independent
 living, such as smartphone apps. More information on this topic can be
 found in Thomas Pocklington Trust’s Assistive and Inclusive Home
 Technology guide, covered in e-Access Bulletin’s July 2016 issue:
 <a href="http://eab.li/7b">http://eab.li/7b</a>
 . <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1208">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1208</a>
 .</p>
<p>
 Blood said that she was struck by the difficulty in finding useful online
 housing information for people with sight loss, and wanted to bring
 together relevant information in one place.
</p>
<p>
 It was important to create a digital publication to reach more people,
 Blood said: “Putting the guide online will get this information out as
 widely as possible, to people who might not typically come into contact
 with some services,” she said.
</p>
<p>
 Links to audio podcasts recorded by Thomas Pocklington Trust are also
 included in the guide, for users to stream or download. The podcasts
 feature people with sight loss talking about housing issues that have
 affected them. Speaking about the making of these podcasts, Blood said:
 “As we developed the guide, it struck us that many people we spoke to
 could benefit from hearing each other’s stories.”
</p>
<p>
 She continued: “I met visually impaired people who had jumped around
 private sector tenancies as much as their sighted peers, but I also meet
 younger people whose confidence about independent living was very low.
 They seemed genuinely inspired to hear that living in your own place with
 a partner was even an option for someone with a visual impairment.”
</p>

<h3 id="i192-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Talking Atms Launched At All Branches Of Major Uk Bank.</h3>
<p>
 Santander has announced talking ATMs for blind and visually impaired
 customers across all of its UK branches.
</p>
<p>
 Many banks offer talking ATMs at some branches, but Santander’s move
 makes it the first bank to offer the service at every one of its UK
 outlets – around 1,400. In May, HSBC launched 1,500 talking cash machines
 around its UK branch network.
</p>
<p>
 To use the service, customers can plug earphones into a socket on the
 front of the ATM, and voice assistance will then guide them through
 operating the machine. Users can also choose whether to use the ATM
 screen during the process for some functions (for example, if they are
 partially sighted and can see some information on-screen) or not at all.
 Staff in the branches will give out headphones to customers who don’t
 have their own.
</p>
<p>
 Santander worked with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)
 and the Digital Accessibility Centre to design the service.
</p>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Interview. – Penny Melville-Brown OBE.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Baking Blind – An Online And Global Adventure.</h3>
<p>
 Cooking is yet another daily task that many people take for granted.
 Having sight loss can make cooking incredibly difficult, but Penny
 Melville-Brown OBE – disability rights advocate and Director of
 Disability Dynamics – wanted to show the world otherwise.
</p>
<p>
 Baking Blind is her YouTube channel and online project, featuring videos
 of Penny – who is blind – preparing all manner of dishes, from curries to
 quails’ eggs to Turkish delight.
</p>
<p>
 Earlier this year, Penny entered the Holman Prize, a competition run by
 San Francisco’s LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired
 organisation to fund big ideas and innovative projects pitched by people
 who are blind. Penny’s ambition was to take her online cookery project
 around the world, cooking across the globe and filming it as she went.
</p>
<p>
 After progressing through the competition, Penny was recently announced
 as one of the three winners to receive funding. Her global dream is about
 to become a reality and audiences will be able to follow her travels and
 exotic recipes through the Baking Blind YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
 E-Access Bulletin chatted with Penny to find out how video, social media
 and other technology helped her in the Holman Prize and how she plans to
 use these platforms in the next stages of her grand trip.
</p>
<p>
 E-Access Bulletin: Please tell us a bit about Baking Blind:
 Penny Melville-Brown: “I’ve been working in the disability employment field
 for nearly 20 years and it is abundantly clear we aren’t going to succeed
 unless employers change their attitudes. We need to change their hearts
 and minds. I thought that cookery might be a great way, as I do lots of
 cooking, and food programmes get so much attention. I was cooking about
 50 mini-Christmas cakes last December for gifts and my brother had time
 to spare to shoot the videos – and Baking Blind was born!”
</p>
<p>
 - What was your goal if you did win the Holman Prize?
 “My goal was to take Baking Blind around the world to cook with professional
 chefs and home cooks, sighted or not, to create a year’s worth of videos and
 show that blindness, and any other disability, doesn’t cramp our ambitions,
 capabilities or zest for life. I’ll be cooking in America, Costa Rica,
 China, Australia and Africa, and I have a full programme of activities
 when I get back to the UK.”
</p>
<p>
 - What part did technology play for you in the competition?
 “I entered by providing a 90-second video called ‘A Taste of the World’.
 I’ve also been using social media and email to gather all the support I
 need for my travels.”
</p>
<p>
 - Video is obviously key in making and sharing Baking Blind. What
   challenges and benefits are there to working with video and YouTube?
 “Obviously I can’t shoot the videos (although I am trying to develop
 some ability with a headcam) and nor can I edit, although I do make
 editorial decisions based on the recorded sounds/voices. Managing
 YouTube doesn’t work for me either. But nowadays, one has to use all
 forms of modern media and technology to have any reach and impact – so
 as a team, we are trying hard.”
</p>
<p>
 - How did it feel to be one of the winners of the prize?
 “Actually, it was very difficult, as I knew before the formal announcement
 and it was tricky to keep my excitement controlled. Now, several weeks
 later, I am beginning to realise how very international the project has
 become, with emails, messages, social media and much more from all over
 the world. What is absolutely clear is that being able to access all
 these different forms of communication is essential for this type of
 project.”
</p>
<p>
 - Tell us about the project you’re now planning:
 “I’ll spend a week in San Francisco with the LightHouse team and then a few
 days cooking there, before flying to Tamarindo in Costa Rica. I’m spending
 a week there in a jungle culinary adventure restaurant. After that, I’ll
 be in Virginia Beach, cooking with local people and meeting up with a
 colleague from the Women’s Royal Naval Service, with whom I’ve had no
 contact for nearly 40 years – the power of social media!
</p>
<p>
 “Soon after that, I’m jetting off to Chongqing in China to cook with and
 help the Rotary Club there with a project supporting local visually
 impaired people. Then to Kiama and Melbourne in Australia with a bevy of
 different cooks, before Lilongwe in Malawi where I’ve linked with local
 groups with visual impairments. Back in the UK, I’m planning a range of
 activities to reinforce my naval links with the Holman Prize, plus baking
 with different local people.”
</p>
<p>
 - What part will technology play in the project?
 “I’m aiming to produce at least one video a week for 12 months, plus a blog
 and social media. There’s no doubt that this whole project would not have
 been possible without being able to contact a worldwide audience.
 Before I started, I only had one possible contact in Australia – all the
 others simply responded to my emails and videos.”
</p>
<p>
 - What’s next for you after that trip?
 “I’d love to continue as a flag-bearer for blind and disabled people over the
 world. With the right adjustments we can do most jobs, contribute to our
 communities and be as independent, fulfilled and ambitious as anyone else.”
