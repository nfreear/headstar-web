<h3 id="i195-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New Online Platform Aims To Be A Game-Changer For Accessible Ict.</h3>
<p> 
 An accessibility resources platform that claims to be ‘the first of its
 kind in the world” has been launched.
</p>
<p> 
 DeveloperSpace aims to be a comprehensive portal for information on
 inclusive digital content and systems, for a wide-ranging audience.
 Although primarily aimed at developers, designers and anyone building
 digital systems or content, the site has been created to foster
 collaboration between different industries and disciplines, in the hope
 of creating and sharing what the site calls ‘accessible solutions’ to ICT
 accessibility problems.
</p>
<p> 
 To identify and address these problems effectively, computer-users with a
 range of impairments were involved at all stages of building
 DeveloperSpace.
</p>
<p> 
 Key features of the site include an ‘Accessibility Masterlist’ (which
 gives information on a range of ICT accessibility features, such as
 alternative computer settings and audio enhancement), ‘Quicksheets’
 (summaries of topics such as social media accessibility and PDF readers)
 and tutorials on a range of topics, such as inclusive e-publishing and
 accessible web games.
</p>
<p> 
 Other features include a question and answer forum and a ‘Challenges’
 section, where people can volunteer to solve accessibility tasks,
 sometimes for prize money or funding. One challenge is based around
 improving a ‘photosensitive seizure tool’ (which detects flashing web
 content that could cause seizures in some users) so that it can be
 released as open source, carrying a reward of $10,000.
</p>
<p> 
 DeveloperSpace was created as the main outcome of the European
 Commission-funded Prosperity4All project and is part of the Global Public
 Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), both of which aim to drive forward
 inclusive technology development and access to these technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 Gregg Vanderheiden – Prosperity4All’s Technical Coordinator and Director
 and Professor of the Trace R&amp;D Center at the University of Maryland –
 told e-Access Bulletin that as well as providing key resources, another
 aim of DeveloperSpace is to collate knowledge and ideas from across the
 board. He said: “A goal is to bring together input from consumers and all
 members of a development team – specialists, testers, teachers,
 researchers and more – to provide individual guides about particular
 aspects of the site that may be helpful to them.”
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about what makes the platform the ‘first of its kind in the
 world,’ Vanderheiden said: “The DeveloperSpace differs from other sites
 in that it looks at the problem comprehensively, providing tools for all
 types of information and communication technologies – including anything
 with a digital interface.”
</p>
<p> 
 DeveloperSpace has already been used to help build and improve a number
 of accessibility projects, some of which are highlighted on the site.
 These include printing services for visually impaired students and a
 programme to create accessible video for refugees in the Netherlands.

<h3 id="i195-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Funkify Plugin Reveals Impaired Browsing To All Users.</h3>
<p> 
 A new browser plugin that distorts web pages to simulate the online
 experience for users with impairments is aiming to encourage developers
 to create more accessible websites and apps.
</p>
<p> 
 The Funkify tool is available in Google Chrome and features a range of
 filters, which intentionally make it difficult to read and navigate
 online content. The intention is to recreate how users with visual, print
 and motor impairments experience the internet.
</p>
<p> 
 Funkify was developed by a team of accessibility enthusiasts from
 companies and startup projects in Sweden. A prototype was created for a
 ‘hackathon’ competition in 2016 and was awarded a joint first place in
 the event.
</p>
<p> 
 The group then successfully applied for innovation funding to build the
 plugin during 2017. A new beta version has just been released for
 testing.
</p>
<p> 
 The team worked with people with a range of impairments, to develop the
 Funkify simulations, which imitate effects of sight loss (including
 blurry vision, tunnel vision and central vision loss), ‘trembling hands’,
 dyslexia and colour vision deficiency.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, the ‘tunnel vision’ filter blanks out a large part of the
 user’s screen, leaving only a small area to read text on the page, while
 the ‘trembling hand’ filter causes the cursor to judder constantly.
</p>
<p> 
 To make the simulations as authentic as possible, the team “interviewed,
 brainstormed and tested” with people with different impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to e-Access Bulletin, one of Funkify’s co-founders, Lena
 Furberg, said: “We strive to make the experience as memorable as
 possible, so that people remember it and have accessibility in mind the
 next time they create a colour palette, choose font sizes or decide on
 the height of click targets.”
</p>
<p> 
 She added: “Of course, everyone experiences things differently, and we’re
 not saying that people will understand exactly what life is like with –
 for example – a tremor if you try the ‘trembling hand’ simulator.”
</p>
<p> 
 Reactions from users without impairments using Funkify have been
 positive, but the goal remains to drive forward inclusive web design and
 content by sharing the tool with developers. “It’s nice to see some
 people get the point of ‘design for all’ and accessibility for the very
 first time when they use Funkify,” Furberg said. “We hope to reach as
 many web and app developers as possible and make them understand the
 importance of making their products accessible, and prioritise this
 higher than they do today.”
</p>
<p> 
 As a follow-up to the project, the team behind Funkify are also building
 a separate tool that will simulate cognitive impairments, including ADHD
 and autism, which will launch in December.

<h3 id="i195-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: New Site Guides Businesses Towards Accessible Tourism.</h3>
<p> 
 Tourism businesses in England and Scotland, such as hotels, restaurants
 and sightseeing attractions are being encouraged to produce
 ‘accessibility guides’ online to let visitors know about access
 facilities.
</p>
<p> 
 VisitEngland and VisitScotland, the official tourist boards for both
 countries, have launched a website that gives organisations a template
 for creating a guide. The result is a single, standardised page
 containing comprehensive access information for users.
</p>
<p> 
 This information is available in simple menus, telling users which areas
 in a venue have level access for wheelchair use, where there are hearing
 loops for visitors with hearing aids, and what facilities exist for
 visually impaired visitors, such as alternative print format menus.
</p>
<p> 
 Also on the page are contact details for each venue, travel and arrival
 information (such as accessible parking facilities and
 wheelchair-friendly ramps), and the option to download the page as a Word
 document.
</p>
<p> 
 Any business can use the site to produce a guide. Users just need to
 register through the site and are then guided through the process
 step-by-step. This includes looking at example guides, answering a
 questionnaire on access facilities at the venue and uploading photos.
</p>
<p> 
 Once the guide has been created, the business is given a unique URL to
 publish and share, allowing everyone to view the page. As the page is
 created through a standardised template, visitors can easily familiarise
 themselves with the format.
</p>
<p> 
 VisitEngland’s head of business support, Ross Calladine, told e-Access
 Bulletin that the guides enable potential visitors to make informed
 decisions about where to visit and stay, based on their individual needs.
 Calladine said: “One in five of the UK population has accessibility
 requirements, meaning that about 20% of potential customers would like to
 have practical information on accessibility. Furthermore, with an ageing
 population, those with accessibility requirements are likely to represent
 an even larger section of the potential customer base. An accessibility
 guide helps businesses to future-proof their venue.”

<p>  In last month’s Inbox, Tony Moss got in touch from Manchester to ask for advice on the accessibility pros and cons of
 iPhones and Android phones, and the apps for each device. Tony, who is
 registered blind but has some vision in his left eye, wanted to know
 which phone would be more useful for him before making a purchase.
</p>
<p> 
 Several readers contacted the Bulletin to flag up resources for Tony,
 including Sophie Grattidge from sight loss charity Henshaws:
</p>
<p> 
 “Henshaws has recently created a free e-book with the 24 best apps for
 people with a visual impairment, which I hope Tony or others may find
 useful. We’ve divided the apps by topic and it covers identification,
 social networking, navigation, shopping, work, reading and entertainment.
</p>
<p> 
 “We also provide free one-to-one training and assessments for visually
 impaired people in Manchester and Liverpool to guide them on what
 technology to use and how to use it. If Tony needs any support, he can
 get in touch by phoning 0161 872 1234 or emailing
 <a href="mailto:carrie.sant@henshaws.org.uk.">carrie.sant@henshaws.org.uk.</a>
</p>
<p> 
 “The e-book can be downloaded at the Henshaws website

 Users just need to put in their email address first.”
</p>
<h3 id="i195-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Device Doctor:</h3>
<p>  Another reader, Hannah Bailey, offers Tony more advice on the iPhone vs Android issue, highlighting some other useful
 resources:
</p>
<p> 
 “Re: Apple vs Android, I think budget needs to be considered.
 Frustratingly, while accessibility settings have certainly improved,
 there is little consistency across brands as to how they are laid out and
 the terminology used in descriptions.
</p>
<p> 
 “I also suggest making sure any type of voiceover technology has a quick
 shortcut option for toggling on and off, as it can be difficult to
 navigate to it quickly in settings.
</p>
<p> 
 “The organisation I work for, Berneslai Homes [a social housing landlord
 managing properties on behalf of Barnsley Council], has made overview
 videos on Apple’s VoiceOver feature and apps for different sensory
 impairments. The videos are available on the Berneslai Homes ‘Device
 Doctor’ YouTube channel
 (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvuoSEIj2wIxjGZsSTQti5w ). We can take
 requests for app overview videos as well.
</p>
<p> 
 “RNIB’s excellent Online Today project
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/online-today">http://www.rnib.org.uk/online-today</a>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Report.– AI at TechShare Pro 2017.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i195-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Artificial intelligence and accessibility:</h3>
<p>  the voice of things to come.
</p>
<p> 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) was high on the agenda at the recent
 TechShare Pro 2017 conference in London. Hosted by AbilityNet and RNIB,
 the event explored a wide range of topics and ideas around digital
 accessibility and accessible technology, with a range of speakers
 discussing key ideas and developments.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the most popular themes of the event was AI and its potential
 benefits for accessibility. AI technologies have evolved at a tremendous
 pace over recent years and are now being used in everything from stock
 market trading to email management – but how can these technologies be
 utilised to help people with disabilities and impairments?
</p>
<p> 
 As delegates at the event heard, numerous innovative systems and projects
 using AI are being developed, which could have a huge impact in the near
 future, but as some speakers pointed out, AI is also being used to
 benefit people right now, in devices and apps that many people use every
 day. Here’s a summary of how AI was covered throughout the event.
</p>
<p> 
 Paul Smyth, Head of ICT Accessibility at Barclays, talked about the
 future of banking from an accessibility point of view and how AI is
 helping to enable this. Processes are becoming simpler, Smyth said, which
 helps users to complete tasks with fewer issues. As an example and to
 show how mobile banking is evolving, he then demonstrated a
 voice-operated payment system through an app.
</p>
<p> 
 “Rather than users having to learn increasingly complicated systems,
 there’s been a paradigm shift, where those systems now learn about users,
 which is very powerful,” Smyth said.
</p>
<p> 
 Smyth also talked about the increasing use of biometrics systems in
 banking, such as fingerprint recognition on apps, alongside voice and
 facial recognition to identify customers.
</p>
<p> 
 He said: “These things are simple and secure, we just need to get more
 comfortable in using them and the technology needs to evolve too.”
</p>
<p> 
 Smyth also talked about how technology is increasing personalisation
 within banking and how this can improve user experience: “The exciting
 bit in terms of AI is how it can power predictive insights,” he said,
 explaining that AI will increasingly be used to advise customers on how
 they can manage their money more effectively.
</p>
<p> 
 Following on from Smyth’s presentation was a panel discussion on ‘What
 does AI mean for the future of accessibility?’, hosted by Robin
 Christopherson, Head of Digital Inclusion at AbilityNet. Ellie Southwood,
 Chair of RNIB, spoke about how various devices and apps are helping make
 life easier for people with visual impairments. She explained how her
 Amazon Echo Dot ‘smart speaker’ (which responds to voice commands and
 questions from users) makes it simpler to find information, before
 talking about a new talking camera app, Seeing AI.
</p>
<p> 
 She said: “The app’s ability to recognise not just text, but also people
 and scenarios, is incredibly exciting, because in order to make decisions
 about the world, you have to interpret it – and if you can’t see, the
 interpretation you have is usually somebody else’s.”
</p>
<p> 
 Hector Minto, Technical Evangelist for Accessibility at Microsoft, then
 explained how he thinks AI will change accessibility. He said: “One of
 the challenges we have is to make accessibility matter to a wider
 audience and this is one of the roles that AI can fulfil. Rather than
 expecting somebody to provide information in an accessible format,
 hopefully AI will mean that all documentation becomes accessible in the
 future.”
</p>
<p> 
 Minto also spoke about Seeing AI and how he believes the app, and other
 similar technologies, can change interactions for people with
 disabilities. He said: “Seeing AI can recognise text, it can recognise
 people and emotion, and recognising something changes the social dynamic
 around disability.”
</p>
<p> 
 Explaining how someone who is blind could use the app to quickly identify
 who is around them, Minto said: “It empowers people to enter a room with
 their disability and take control, and that is a leveller.”
</p>
<p> 
 Following the discussion, an audience member asked the panel about
 potential difficulties in using AI-based voice technologies, particularly
 for people with cognitive impairments, and how these systems could be
 made more accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Responding to the question, Ellie Southwood said that there are still
 “gaps” in the technology, but that using voice-operated AI systems to
 carry out complicated tasks “has to be the future.” She explained that
 these systems need to be customer-led and built around specific needs of
 users to ensure they work effectively.
</p>
<p> 
 Hector Minto agreed with this point, claiming that: “People with
 disabilities are going to lead the knowledge base on voice interaction.”
</p>
<p> 
 Later on in the day, Gareth Ford Williams, Head of Accessibility for
 Design and Engineering at the BBC, hosted a session on ‘The BBC
 Accessibility Journey and the Impact of Artificial Intelligence.’
 Williams discussed how new and emerging technologies are being used by
 the BBC to make its operations more accessible for users.
</p>
<p> 
 He explained how AI can be used in ‘object-based broadcasting’ to learn
 about users’ viewing habits and tailor how programmes are delivered to
 them based on their requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking more generally about the potential of AI systems, Williams said:
 “Disenfranchised audiences are really going to benefit. For older
 audiences and others who struggle to use some assistive technologies,
 having something more humanistic as a mode of interaction is going to
 create a lot of opportunities for them.”
</p>
<p> 
 In the afternoon, Kiran Kaja, Technical Program Manager for Search
 Accessibility at Google, gave some insights on current and future use of
 AI. He pointed out that “AI is everywhere. It’s already being used quite
 widely – for example, in speech recognition, which is based on ‘neural
 networks’. This uses ‘machine learning’ to replicate how the human
 nervous system works.”
</p>
<p> 
 He explained that improvements to text-to-speech and predictive text
 systems are being made using AI, before discussing ‘computer vision’, in
 reference to the kind of image recognition that apps like Seeing AI use.
 Kaja said: “Being able to use computer vision to recognise objects and
 find the relationship between the objects – those things have really big
 potential for helping people with disabilities.”
</p>
<p> 
 Kaja also addressed a key issue that delegates had been discussing
 throughout the day: ease-of-use of AI systems, particularly for users
 with impairments. He said: “The great thing about all of this is that as
 a user, you shouldn’t need to worry about what AI is and what it can do –
 it should all just work for you. That’s the hallmark of great UX [user
 experience] design.”
