<h3 id="i187-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Hollywood-Voiced Avatar Solves Citizens’ Accessibility Queries.</h3>
<p> 
 An online avatar voiced by an Oscar-winning actor has been created to give
 disabled Australian citizens information on the country’s National
 Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
</p>
<p> 
 The virtual assistant ‘Nadia’ is voiced by Australian actor Cate
 Blanchett and is able to answer common questions about the NDIS – a
 support scheme for Australian citizens under 65 with a permanent
 disability, replacing a previous national disability scheme. Users interact
 with Nadia through their computer’s webcam and microphone. This gives the
 process a human element and means that only minimal keyboard or mouse
 navigation is needed.
</p>
<p> 
 Nadia was developed by Soul Machines, a New Zealand-based company
 specialising in avatars and artificial intelligence projects. The company
 was launched by Mark Sagar, a university professor and Oscar-winner for his
 work on digital visual effects.
</p>
<p> 
 To provide Nadia’s voice, Blanchett (who has starred in films including
 ‘Blue Jasmine’, ‘The Aviator’ and the ‘Lord of the Rings’
 trilogy) recorded thousands of sentences, which will be cut and combined to
 form completely new sentences to different questions. Soul Machines say
 that Nadia’s database of knowledge will increase as she ‘learns’ from
 more users asking more questions. Visually, Nadia is represented by a
 lifelike human face, which displays emotions.
</p>
<p> 
 Nadia’s design was informed by the NDIS Digital Innovation Reference
 Group, a collaboration between Australian citizens with disabilities,
 members of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), and figures
 from the technology industries.
</p>
<p> 
 In a video about the project, posted by Soul Machines on YouTube, Maryanne
 Diamond from the NDIS explains that Nadia was created to help overcome the
 challenges faced by disabled citizens in communicating with the NDIA, such
 as inaccessible web forms or letters containing lots of “government
 language”.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, one of Nadia’s pre-recorded sentences (heard in the Soul
 Machines YouTube video) is: “One of the many reasons I have been created
 is to get rid of tens of thousands of government forms that often take
 hours of people’s time to complete.”
</p>
<p> 
 Writing on the Soul Machines blog, Louise Glanville – Deputy CEO of the
 NDIA – said that Nadia will be accessible “24/7” at the NDIS
 ‘myplace’ portal (for Australian citizens with sign-in credentials) and
 is designed to meet international accessibility guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 Glanville writes: “She can already understand thousands of questions put
 to her, and will answer with clear and simple responses. The more
 interactions she has with people, the more her knowledge bank will grow.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Online Shopping ‘Not As Inclusive As It Should Be,’ New Researchfinds.
</h3>
<p> 
 The websites of six popular UK retailers would not achieve the basic
 standard of online content accessibility, according to new research by a
 usability consultancy.
</p>
<p> 
 After a series of ‘mini-accessibility audits,’ accessibility design
 consultancy User Vision found that some online shoppers with impairments
 would have difficulty purchasing items from each of the websites examined,
 due to a number of common barriers.
</p>
<p> 
 The retailers chosen for the study were selected “to cover as many
 segments of the market as possible,” Marie Moyles, a UX (user experience)
 analyst at User Vision, told e-Access Bulletin. The six stores were as
 follows, in order of the accessibility score awarded in the research: House
 of Fraser (scoring 3/5); Boots (3/5); Tesco (2.5/5); Mothercare (2.5/5);
 Not on the High Street (1/5); and Joules (1/5).
</p>
<p> 
 “We wanted to select a range of stores which were well known, trusted and
 provided a variety of products for differing budgets and tastes,” Moyles
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 User Vision claims that, “in their present state”, all of the sites
 would fail testing for Level AA of WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines) 2.0 – widely seen as the benchmark for online accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The accessibility audits focused on the experience of blind screen-reader
 users and sighted keyboard-only users – specifically on the ‘user
 journeys’ when browsing and purchasing products through the six sites.
 Aspects of WCAG 2.0 were then used as an indicator of the websites’
 accessibility levels.
</p>
<p> 
 Common accessibility barriers found during the testing included a lack of
 consistent visible focus (which helps sighted keyboard-only users track
 their place on a webpage) and a lack of ‘skip to’ links (especially
 important for screen-reader users to quickly navigate to relevant content).
</p>
<p> 
 Moyles told e-Access Bulletin that the main barrier uncovered in the
 testing was a difficulty in providing context for screen-reader users.
 “It is important to remember that those who rely on screen-readers are
 unable to visually group information together or understand meaning through
 visible presentation,” she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about the key findings from the audits, Moyles said: “The main
 message was that, unfortunately, shopping online is not as inclusive as it
 could and should be. There is still some way to go in improving the
 accessibility of online stores.”
</p>
<p> 
 Although User Vision says that none of the sites achieved WCAG 2.0 Level AA
 standard from the mini-audits, Moyles said that the majority of the sites
 were “aware of accessibility” and had attempted to implement some
 accessible features. “The most important thing to consider is that the
 issues we came across are actually quite easy to correct,” said Moyles.
</p>
<p> 
 Asked what retailers should be doing to improve online accessibility,
 Moyles said: “Retailers should be investing in usability testing with
 disabled people to ascertain that the site is usable as much as it is
 compliant to WCAG standards.”

<h3 id="i187-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Ai App Learns As It Provides A Window To The World.</h3>
<p> 
 An image recognition app that identifies objects and colours for blind and
 visually impaired people through AI (artificial intelligence) technology
 can ‘learn’ about its surroundings as users teach it.
</p>
<p> 
 The free version of the Aipoly Vision app comes pre-loaded with information
 and is able to identify around 1,000 ‘essential’ items (such as coffee
 cups, headphones and flowers) immediately after being downloaded.
</p>
<p> 
 Users simply point their phone at an item and Aipoly then speaks the name
 of the item out loud. The app was designed to help users with sight loss or
 low vision identify more of the world around them without the assistance of
 a sighted person.
</p>
<p> 
 Aipoly runs and identifies constantly without an internet connection, and
 users don’t need to take photos of individual items in order for the app
 to recognise them. Aipoly’s developers claim that it can identify items
 at a rate of three per second.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can switch between different modes to recognise different groups of
 things, such as foods, text, currency, plants and colours. The Aipoly
 recognition system works through what the company calls a “real-time deep
 learning SDK” (software development kit).
</p>
<p> 
 A paid-for version of the app, costing $4.99 per month, features a much
 larger pre-installed database of objects. But users can also help build
 Aipoly’s database manually, by inputting descriptions of new objects or
 objects that the app identifies incorrectly.
</p>
<p> 
 These descriptions are stored on the app for future recognition – to help
 the individual user – but also get uploaded to the Aipoly servers. This
 information is then used by Aipoly’s development team when updating the
 app, therefore benefitting other users too.
</p>
<p> 
 So far, reviews and feedback have generally been positive, with users
 (including blind and visually impaired users) impressed by the app’s ease
 of use and wide recognition abilities. However, many also report at least
 some errors when the app is identifying objects.
</p>
<p> 
 Aiploy Vision is currently only available for the iPhone and iPad, via the
 iTunes app store, but a version for Android devices is scheduled for April
 15. In January, the app was given a ‘2017 Innovation Award’ by the
 Consumer Technology Association at its annual CES (Consumer Electronics
 Show) event.

<p>  Last week, regular Bulletin correspondent Carine Marzin got in touch to ask if other readers knew of any research on the
 accessibility of online retail sites – particularly any studies that
 showed companies prioritising digital accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Another regular reader, Rick Williams, replies to Carine’s comment this
 month:
</p>
<p> 
 “Hi, Carine. I was one of the joint authors of the Click-Away Pound
 report, which researched the commercial issues regarding website and app
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 “One of the many interesting things that came out of the research was
 that one person’s accessible site was someone else’s inaccessible one.
 We asked people to nominate their best and worst sites in terms of their
 access needs, and many sites appeared on both lists from different users.
 Clearly, the issue was the effect of their disability and their associated
 access needs.
</p>
<p> 
 “One site which came out consistently well was the Ocado shopping site
 and app.”

Section Three: Interview.
- Sonya Huber, Disability March.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Impactful Online Activism.</h3>
<p> 
 On January 21 2017, around half a million people took part in the Women's
 March in Washington D. C. Symbolically scheduled for the day after Donald
 Trump’s inauguration as 45th President of the United States, the aim of
 the Women’s March was to support and stand up for women’s rights and
 equality around the world, with millions more marching across the globe in
 related events. But what about those people who wanted to support the cause
 but couldn’t attend a march in person?
</p>
<p> 
 This was the dilemma facing many people with a disability or health issues.
 To address this widespread problem, an online virtual march was set up. The
 Disability March platform enabled anyone to show their support for the
 cause without having to physically march – a task that would have been
 dangerous for some and impossible for others.
</p>
<p> 
 Supporters signed-up to the online Disability March and shared their
 messages through the project’s blog and Twitter account. Thousands took
 part and others were able to see their stories unfold online.
</p>
<p> 
 Sonya Huber, an author and creative writing professor from Connecticut, was
 one of the organisers of the Disability March. e-Access Bulletin spoke to
 Huber to find out more.
</p>
<p> 
 - Please explain the concept of the Disability March:
</p>
<p> 
 “The Disability March is, in the simplest form, a blog. Each
 ‘marcher’ was an entry on the blog, and each entry was a photo of an
 individual along with his or her story of disability and message about
 marching in solidarity with the Women’s Marches. Most stories were
 explicit about the disability, the inability to physically march, and/or
 the ways in which the marcher would be impacted by proposed policies of the
 Trump administration.
</p>
<p> 
 “The blog was also linked to a Twitter account, <a href="mailto:@DisabilityMarch">@DisabilityMarch</a>, so that as the marchers were put online by the volunteer team, the effect for
 viewers of the blog, and on Twitter, was of a parade slowly rolling by.
 Many people watched or engaged with these pieces when they were published
 and in the weeks after publication, and shared their own profiles as well
 as the profiles of others who moved them.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What was the background to the project?
</p>
<p> 
 “I came up with the idea for the Disability March in early December 2016,
 as plans for the January 2017 Women’s March in Washington D.C. were being
 hatched, and as I realised I wouldn’t be able to attend due to my
 rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions. I shared the idea of
 a blog with a few friends, as a space for telling stories of those who are
 disabled and couldn’t march. We had our first ‘marcher’, Karrie
 Higgins, on December 21, and my goal was to get to 50 postings on the
 blog.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What was the overall goal of the Disability March?
</p>
<p> 
 “Our main idea was to be visible as members of the disability community
 who are going to be heavily impacted by the Trump administration’s
 proposed policy changes to the ACA [Affordable Care Act] and proposed cuts
 to Medicaid. So our goal was to put the stories of disabled people front
 and centre, giving them space to say what they feared about the Trump
 agenda and what we need as a community.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How did the online march go on the day?
</p>
<p> 
 “A week before the Women’s March, we started to get hundreds of
 entries. I recruited about 20 volunteers to help with uploading the entries
 by hand into the blog. During the day of the march I didn’t go to a local
 physical march; I was on the computer for about 12 hours a day, uploading
 and responding to inquiries.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How many people took part in the online Disability March?
</p>
<p> 
 “Our final number was 3,021 entries. I was completely surprised by the
 success of it.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What do you think it shows about the power of technology for persons with
 disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 “I think it shows that people who aren’t able to attend marches are
 nevertheless hungering for participation, connection, and visibility.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What has been the reaction since the online march?
</p>
<p> 
 “We have a Facebook group of about 1,800 people and we are in touch with
 other disability rights organisations to talk about how to move forward.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Are any online marches planned for the future?
</p>
<p> 
 “We are talking about possibilities!”
</p>
<p> 
 - What else do you have planned for the project now the Women’s March has
 finished?
</p>
<p> 
 “The blog from the march will stay up, and we are using the website and
 Twitter to share resources about disability and action in politics.”
</p>
<p> 
 - I see you’re also encouraging people to arrange their own online
 disability marches. Tell us about that:
</p>
<p> 
 “I want to get the wider political organising community to take on doing
 these visibility actions, in order to include those people in their
 communities. This is an organising tool that any organisation can use.”
