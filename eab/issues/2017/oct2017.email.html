<h3 id="i194-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Technology Is Key To Making Travel More Accessible, New Report Finds.</h3>
<p>
 People with access needs still face numerous barriers when booking and
 undertaking travel, but existing and emerging technologies are crucial to
 making the process more accessible, research claims.
</p>
<p>
 The new report found that while advancing technologies such as voice
 recognition, artificial intelligence and virtual reality are being used
 by some companies and hotels to make travel more inclusive, website
 accessibility and use of mobile devices – for tasks such as managing
 bookings – are still fundamental for travellers with access needs.
</p>
<p>
 The study, ‘Voyage of discovery: Working towards inclusive and accessible
 travel for all’, was commissioned by travel technology consulting firm
 Amadeus and carried out by Ilunion, a consulting firm owned by ONCE, the
 Spanish National Organisation of the Blind. It looks at the requirements
 and first-hand experiences of travellers with access needs and explores
 how ‘the travel experience and customer journey’ can be made more
 accessible by examining three stages of the process: ‘The pre-travel
 stage: what happens before the trip’, ‘In transit: what happens on the
 journey’ and ‘In destination: what happens upon arrival’.
</p>
<p>
 Results are based on responses from focus groups and interviews with
 consumer travellers and industry experts, featuring contributions from
 people with “visual, hearing, cognitive and physical disabilities,” and
 travellers over 65-years-old with accessibility needs, all from the
 United States, European Union and India.
</p>
<p>
 Speaking about the findings of the report, Elizabeth Aston, Senior
 Advisor for Industry Affairs at Amadeus IT Group, told e-Access Bulletin
 that “Technology will be a pivotal factor in making travel more
 accessible. We are already seeing companies use mobile applications, more
 intuitive user interfaces, voice recognition, data analytics and customer
 management systems to help address [access barriers] identified by
 travellers … But technology is not the sole answer, it must also be seen
 in the wider context of accessibility, as an enabler and facilitator of
 change and action.”
</p>
<p>
 As demonstrated in the report, the same technology that can aid more
 accessible travel can also become an obstacle when it is not designed
 inclusively. For example, difficulty in navigating inaccessible travel
 websites was found to be one of the biggest barriers for users during the
 booking stage.
</p>
<p>
 The report also notes that when booking a trip online, “there is a lack
 of standard procedures for communicating passengers’ specific needs.”
 Despite this and other issues, the report found that online booking was
 still by far the most popular method for booking trips.
</p>
<p>
 A later section of the report examines how technology is empowering
 travellers. The report notes that “Some hotel chains are using mobile
 apps to allow guests access to their rooms and other facilities, and
 others are using virtual reality to demonstrate accommodation and
 services.”
</p>
<p>
 Here, the study points towards the increasing use of Bluetooth-enabled
 navigation beacons, wearable technologies and even driverless cars as
 potential future aids for accessible travel.
</p>
<p>
 Other significant findings from the report include the discovery that
 “travellers would increase their travel budget by 34% if accessibility
 barriers were eliminated,” representing a clear business incentive for
 the industry alongside moral obligations.
</p>
<p>
 The report ends by making recommendations on how the industry can work
 towards making travel more accessible for all, including a call for the
 development of “global standards for accessibility in travel and
 tourism.”

<h3 id="i194-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: ‘Call For Evidence’ Launched To Help Make Voting More Accessible.</h3>
<p>
 The UK Government is gathering public opinion to find out how accessible
 the country’s electoral system is for persons with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
 The Call for Evidence was launched online by the Cabinet Office to
 collect information about direct experiences of voters with disabilities
 in elections.
</p>
<p>
 The document claims that responses will “help identify if current
 mechanisms to support disabled people to participate in the democratic
 process are sufficient,” as well as identifying good practice from the
 Electoral Services Team in elections.
</p>
<p>
 Questions in the Call for Evidence ask respondents detailed questions
 about their experience in registering to vote and casting a vote,
 including what can be done to make these processes easier for persons
 with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
 Other sections focus on support provided to persons with disabilities at
 elections, and whether any support received has been sufficient. The
 document also provides a summary of the support that must be offered by
 law to persons with disabilities at elections.
</p>
<p>
 Responses to the Call for Evidence will help inform a report highlighting
 key findings and giving recommendations for making elections more
 accessible. The report will be published by the government and the
 Accessibility of Elections Group in spring 2018 after responses are
 reviewed by the Cabinet Office Accessibility Working Group, whose members
 include RNIB, the Royal Mencap Society, Scope, the NHS and the Electoral
 Commission.
</p>
<p>
 The Call for Evidence is available online in HTML or in accessible Word
 document and PDF versions (produced with guidance from RNIB), and ‘easy
 read’ Word and PDF versions, produced with guidance from Mencap.
</p>
<p>
 The deadline for responses, which can be sent via email or post, is
 November 14.

<h3 id="i194-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Procurement Is Key For Accessible Ict In The Workplace, Claims New Guide.</h3>
<p>
 A detailed online resource to help employers purchase effective
 accessible technology through their procurement processes has been
 released.
</p>
<p>
 The guide, called ‘Buy IT!’, has been produced by the US-based
 Partnership on Employment &amp; Accessible Technology (PEAT).
</p>
<p>
 The introduction to Buy IT! states that a successful accessible ICT
 purchasing strategy means: “doing vendor research, specifying your
 requirements, and validating the accessibility of your product choices
 prior to accepting and implementing them. Most importantly, it means
 approaching ICT procurement with an eye toward accessibility and
 usability from the very beginning.”
</p>
<p>
 A detailed step-by-step plan for employers and purchasing staff is then
 set out, explaining how to work towards an accessible procurement
 programme in three sections: planning, solicitation and ‘post-award’.
</p>
<p>
 The ‘planning’ section explores how employers can gain executive support
 for accessible procurement and what to look for when researching vendors.
 ‘Solicitation’ gives a thorough grounding in writing an
 accessibility-focused procurement solicitation, including requesting
 accessibility information from vendors and contractors, and ensuring that
 the solicitation documents are fully accessible. As the guide points out,
 this last step “is especially useful for attracting vendors that may
 employ people with disabilities who may not otherwise be able to access
 your solicitation.”
</p>
<p>
 The final section, ‘post-award’, gives a detailed breakdown of steps to
 take when employers are ready to make a contract award. The guide
 emphasises the importance of ‘testing and validation’ here, to avoid
 potentially difficult scenarios in the next stage of the process: “All
 too often, customers take vendors at their word when they say a product
 is accessible, and then accept it without testing the product and
 validating the claim,” the guide says.
</p>
<p>
 The key to avoiding this situation is ‘acceptance testing’, claims the
 guide, which helps determine whether a procured product meets the
 necessary criteria drawn up in the sales contract. The guide then goes on
 to outline models to test for ICT accessibility.

<p>  Tony Moss from Manchester, UK, has contacted e-Access Bulletin to ask for advice on purchasing a smartphone. Tony
 wants to know the benefits that both iPhone and Android phones offer for
 blind and visually impaired users. As Tony points out, it’s a
 much-discussed issue and many people are loyal to their preferred brand,
 but what if you need some objective advice about both systems? Over to
 Tony:
</p>
<p>
 “I am looking for impartial information on the pros and cons, for a
 visually impaired consumer, when deciding whether to purchase an iPhone
 or Android smartphone, reflecting the most up-to-date accessibility
 features for either a blind or partially sighted person.
</p>
<p>
 “I am trying to compare systems and deciding which is best for me. I’m
 registered blind but have some residual vision in my left eye, and in
 certain conditions with high-magnification I can see the phone’s screen,
 but I would need inverted colours. However, at other times – outdoors,
 for example – I would be unable to see the screen and would need to rely
 on speech output to operate the phone.
</p>
<p>
 “It’s difficult to find a comprehensive comparison article or independent
 information resource, and individuals’ views are often solely informed
 from one perspective. Most blind people I know swear by their iPhone, but
 Android are making great strides with their accessibility features, but
 it’s harder to find a proper assessment of these.
</p>
<p>
 “It would also be useful to know about the availability of apps for
 visually impaired users on each system, and which apps are popular with
 VI users.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: How To Buy A Hamburger Without Losing Your Self-Esteem.</h3>
<p>
 By Mel Poluck.
</p>
<p>
 When the CNIB (formerly the Canadian National Institute for the Blind)
 opened its community hub last summer in Yonge St., Toronto, it set its
 ambitions high.
</p>
<p>
 “We moved in, sat down and thought ‘how can we make this neighbourhood
 the most accessible in Canada?’” says CNIB’s Kat Clarke, Specialist Lead
 (Toronto), Advocacy and Government Relations (Ontario).
</p>
<p>
 “The closest intersection to us wasn’t accessible, so we advocated to the
 [local council] to make it more accessible, which they’ve done,” says
 Clarke.
</p>
<p>
 Now, a CNIB pilot aims to take local accessibility a step further using
 simple technology. ‘ShopTalk: BlindSquare Enabled’, allows blind and
 visually impaired people to find their way around the interiors of shops,
 cafés and other businesses in the neighbourhood via an app on their
 phone.
</p>
<p>
 Small Bluetooth devices (‘beacons’) are mounted on the wall of the
 premises, near the door. When the user is in range, the app picks up on
 the Bluetooth signal, then speaks directions to the user. These
 directions use the clock-face method, such as: ‘Upon entrance, washrooms
 are at nine o’clock’. The directions also orientate users with distances,
 like ‘forward five metres to counter.’
</p>
<p>
 To activate the GPS-enabled app, users simply shake their phone. Shaking
 a second time triggers further information, such as shop opening times.
</p>
<p>
 “Businesses don’t have control over what the messaging is,” says Clarke.
 “We would never want it hijacked so business owners could include a
 two-for-one offer, for example.”
</p>
<p>
 CNIB can also tweak or add new information based on changing
 circumstances – if the layout of a store changes or construction work is
 taking place at the entrance, for example. The range of the Bluetooth
 signal is normally set between five and ten metres, but can be adjusted
 to avoid interference, such as when beacons are located in consecutive
 shops.
</p>
<p>
 The app itself is a free version of the BlindSquare app from MIPSoft,
 which allows blind and visually impaired users to navigate outside. The
 app can be downloaded from the iTunes store in a range of languages (read
 more at the BlindSquare website:
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://eab.li/8k">http://eab.li/8k</a>

 <a href="http://www.blindsquare.com/">http://www.blindsquare.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p>
 So far, “under 50” beacons have been deployed in the Yonge and St. Clair
 neighbourhood, says Clarke, but CNIB aims to install 200 by February
 2018.
</p>
<p>
 For now, the focus is on getting more organisations on board. CNIB staff,
 volunteers and the visually impaired community are informing businesses
 of the scheme via email and in person. ‘Hello neighbour,’ opens its
 standard letter, ‘We want to help you make your business more accessible
 and inclusive,’ it says.
</p>
<p>
 Clarke says this part of the initiative has been challenging, not least
 because of common misconceptions.
</p>
<p>
 “Some people have declined to take part. It comes from misunderstanding
 what accessibility means,” she says. “It’s the attitude when people have
 an invisible disability: ‘I don’t have blind customers!’ How do you know?
 Maybe you would if you had the beacons,” says Clarke.
</p>
<p>
 She says that reluctance may also stem from fears over security, with
 banks showing particular concern. But CNIB has won over many sceptical
 organisations, explaining that they do not capture data on users and the
 beacons emit low-frequency Bluetooth, meaning there is no cost to
 businesses, as neither electricity nor wi-fi is being used.
</p>
<p>
 There has been an “overwhelmingly positive” attitude from the majority of
 local businesses, says Clarke. Once a business agrees to host a beacon,
 the process is simple. “We go out and look at the space,” Clarke
 explains. “Once we know where beacons will be placed – someone literally
 puts it on the wall with tack – we can create messages based on that.”
</p>
<p>
 “It opens up a whole new world,” says Ray Smith, who is blind and uses
 the app. “Let’s say I want to get a hamburger. Once I open up the door of
 the restaurant, I lose my independence and I lose my self-esteem.
</p>
<p>
 “And then there’s the safety concern – there may be stairs facing me. The
 app will tell me if there are stairs in front of me and if I turn to
 three o’clock there’s a counter. So I can independently find the counter.
 I’m not asking anyone else. It’s amazing.”
</p>
<p>
 Smith has already used the app in a chemist, several restaurants and the
 local Baptist church, the largest in the country.
</p>
<p>
 “Some people don’t want to ask ‘where’s this?’ or ‘where’s that?’ I’ve
 talked to people using it and they are getting about more. I think I’ve
 got more independence, absolutely.”
</p>
<p>
 Smith says he is particularly looking forward to banks using the beacons,
 because locating a cash machine (ATM) as a blind customer is
 traditionally difficult due to the wide variation in their positioning.
</p>
<p>
 Such indoor navigation systems are gathering pace globally. The same
 BlindSquare technology has been used in Wellington, New Zealand, where
 200 shops are participating in the ‘No Dark Doors’ project.
</p>
<p>
 Meanwhile, in the northern hemisphere, a notable example is Wayfindr,
 which is being trialled on the London Underground. Originating from the
 Royal London Society for Blind People’s (RLSB) Youth Forum, the idea
 received &pound;1 million funding through the Google Impact Challenge
 Disabilities programme. Wayfindr has also developed the world’s first
 standard for accessible audio navigation (Read e-Access Bulletin’s
 previous coverage of Wayfindr:

 <a href="http://eab.li/1t">http://eab.li/1t</a>

 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1185">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1185</a>
 ).</p>
<p>
 The CNIB’s initiative has enough money to run for a year, thanks to
 funding of $26,000 from the Rick Hansen Foundation’s Access4All Program.
 Once the target of 200 beacons has been reached, the priority will be to
 secure sustainable funding beyond 2017, and then expand the scheme, based
 on data and feedback.
</p>
<p>
 The future looks promising. A property development company recently
 requested beacons for all of its buildings, and a bank, the Transit
 Commission (Toronto’s local government department for transport) and
 library are also interested. Most recently, a theatre installed four
 beacons, so that users of the app can independently find their way to the
 box office to buy tickets, get to their seat and find the bar.
</p>
<p>
 And with some 10,000 people with sight loss expected to visit the new
 CNIB community hub in its first year, take-up of the system is likely to
 be significant.
</p>
<p>
 The project is improving the independence of blind and visually impaired
 people living in or visiting the neighbourhood. But one gets the
 impression that the real aim is a long-term change in attitude.
</p>
<p>
 “We’re hoping we can use this as an interesting conversation starter and
 have a much longer discussion with businesses – what about access to
 customer services or your sandwich board in the street, for example?” Kat
 Clarke says. “There’s a longer-term educational piece. Already we’ve had
 a fantastic result. We’ve started conversations.”
</p>
<p>
 Smith echoes the sentiment. “You’ve still got to have customer services
 and etiquette, but it’s planting a seed.”
