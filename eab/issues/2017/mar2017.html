<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New Parliamentary Group On Assistive Tech Launches To Level Theplaying Field.
</h3>
<p> 
 A “flood” of new technology represents a unique opportunity to increase
 education and employment for those with disabilities in the UK, claims a
 new cross-party parliamentary group.
</p>
<p> 
 The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Assistive Technology (APPGAT)
 launched on March 6 and aims to spark debate and share knowledge on
 assistive technology (AT) throughout parliament. Its work will include
 contributing to government consultations and raising awareness of AT.
</p>
<p> 
 In an exclusive APPGAT interview with e-Access Bulletin, the group’s
 Chair, Seema Malhotra MP (a former Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury),
 said that those in government and parliament need to harness new AT, to
 “transform the lives and opportunities available to disabled people.”
 APPGAT will aid this process, acting as a forum for new ideas.
</p>
<p> 
 Malhotra also told e-Access Bulletin that disability is not yet given
 enough prominence in social reform. She said: “If we are to have a truly
 equal society, then we have to make sure that the issue of disability is as
 much on the agenda of education and of the workplace as we have seen with
 gender and race. In my view, we are certainly not there nearly enough.”
</p>
<p> 
 APPGAT’s co-chairs include Lord Low of Dalston CBE (current Vice
 President of the Royal National Institute of blind People), Lord Holmes of
 Richmond MBE (a Paralympian and multiple gold medallist), and Matt Warman
 MP (a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee).
</p>
<p> 
 APPGAT was set up by Policy Connect – a not-for-profit social enterprise
 – with input from disability and technology sector experts (including the
 ACE Centre), and the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the first major projects planned is for APPGAT to submit a
 recommendation paper to the Treasury before the UK Budget statement in
 autumn. Malhotra said that the paper will look at the impact of AT within
 the workplace and education.
</p>
<p> 
 Following that paper, APPGAT will take a deeper look into employment and
 education gaps for persons with disabilities, and how AT can be used to
 address these gaps.
</p>
<p> 
 The group will also draw up a programme of events and meetings to progress
 discussion and awareness of AT throughout parliament. As well as
 parliamentarians, these events will feature sector experts, academics and
 AT users.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about the challenge of pushing disability and AT higher on to
 parliamentary agendas, Malhotra said: “I believe it is the next big nut
 to crack. I think parliament has to play its part in making sure that we
 not only change the attitudes of government, but also look at how that can
 be translated into attitudes in the workplace and society more generally.
 Incremental change can achieve so much, but to really build on that
 progress and create real transformation is going to need political
 leadership and action by government.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Impaired Users And Mobile Access Prioritised In New Web Accessibilityguidelines.
</h3>
<p> 
 The first public draft of an update to the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG) has been released, with an increased focus on mobile
 content, users with low vision, and users with cognitive and learning
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The current guidelines – WCAG 2.0 – are seen by many as a benchmark for
 web accessibility. WCAG 2.0 is widely used by authorities and organisations
 seeking to review websites, and to make and keep them accessible for users
 with disabilities. For example, the Society of IT Management (Socitm) uses
 WCAG 2.0 to test the accessibility of UK council websites in its annual
 Better Connected review.
</p>
<p> 
 The public working draft of the update, WCAG 2.1, seeks to build on the
 existing guidelines, adding in new recommendations for those creating and
 designing web content.
</p>
<p> 
 WCAG 2.1 is being developed by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group
 (AGWG), a sub-group of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). WAI is part
 of the much larger World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international
 voluntary standards community founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
</p>
<p> 
 Judy Brewer, Director of the Web Accessibility Initiative at W3C, told
 e-Access Bulletin about some of the new measures to be included in WCAG
 2.1. This includes an extension of requirements for mobile device access.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about other new measures, Brewer said: “Research, tools and
 awareness in the areas of accessibility for people with cognitive and
 learning disabilities, and for people with low vision, have been increasing
 in recent years, and we are updating WCAG 2.1 to reflect this.”
</p>
<p> 
 The next steps are for AGWG to review and respond to public feedback, and
 make changes for new versions of the WCAG 2.1 draft. The draft will
 continue to be reviewed and evolve throughout 2017, with further testing in
 early 2018. “The goal is to finalise [the draft WCAG 2.1] as a W3C
 recommendation (a web standard) by mid-2018,” Brewer said.
</p>
<p> 
 A longer-term ‘3.0’ update to WCAG is also being worked on by AGWG’s
 ‘Silver Task Force’, Brewer told e-Access Bulletin. She said: “The
 [Task Force] are initially focusing on improvements in terms of usability
 of the guidelines themselves, but may also look at expanding the scope to
 encompass technologies that are converging on the web, such as digital
 publishing or the Internet of Things. The goal is to produce a very
 flexible set of guidelines that can adapt even better to evolving
 technology and user needs.”
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about W3C’s aim for organisations to begin implementing the WCAG
 2.1 draft – and upcoming final version – Brewer called on Bulletin
 readers to help get the message out:
</p>
<p> 
 “There are many things that readers of e-Access Bulletin can help with,
 starting with helping to spread the word of the update under development.
 Then, eventually, spreading the word that there’s an updated standard,
 encouraging people to implement it, and to adopt and reference it in
 policies that they have an opportunity to impact.”
</p>
<p> 
 Public feedback on the draft officially closes on March 31, but Brewer told
 e-Access Bulletin that comments received after that will still be useful.
 Feedback on the draft can be emailed to the following address:
 <a href="mailto:public-agwg-comments@w3.org">public-agwg-comments@w3.org</a> .</p>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Many Us Government Sites Not Accessible For Disabled Users, Claims Newresearch.
</h3>
<p> 
 Various high-profile US government websites, including major service
 portals, are not accessible for users with disabilities, according to a new
 study.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘Benchmarking U.S. Government Websites’ report found that 42% of US
 federal sites tested failed to meet the necessary accessibility criteria.
</p>
<p> 
 The report aims to give a broad picture of US government website usability
 across a range of categories. A total of 297 federal sites were reviewed
 for accessibility, speed, mobile friendliness and security.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the most common accessibility problems found was a failure to add
 labels to elements on a page. These text labels and descriptions help
 screen-reader users to navigate web pages, and were found to be lacking on
 images, buttons and input forms.
</p>
<p> 
 Other accessibility issues included a lack of contrast between text and
 background colour (making it difficult for some sighted users to pick out
 content), failure to put content in a sequential order (ordering content
 properly is important for screen-reader and keyboard-only users), and a
 failure to make text “sufficiently readable and understandable” (for
 example, not specifying the language used, which can impact on a
 screen-reader’s pronunciation).
</p>
<p> 
 The report was produced by ITIF (the Information Technology &amp; Innovation
 Foundation, a non-profit think tank that aims to provide information for
 technology policy-makers) and authored by Alan McQuinn and Daniel Castro.
</p>
<p> 
 The federal sites were tested using AChecker, an evaluation tool that
 identifies accessibility problems on webpages using different sets of
 guidelines selected by the user. WCAG 2.0 (the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines 2.0) was used by ITIF to evaluate the government sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Although these types of automated tools can identify a number of barriers,
 relying on them is often discouraged by accessibility practitioners due to
 their limitations, such as the lack of direct user-testing by humans.
</p>
<p> 
 AChecker claims to bypass part of this problem, by flagging up ‘likely’
 and ‘potential’ problems, which need human assessment to be resolved.
 However, the ITIF report only tested the US government sites for
 ‘known’ problems, which are automatically detected by AChecker. The
 report claims that this was “to avoid unfairly penalizing sites”.
</p>
<p> 
 Rated purely on these accessibility terms, the top three US government
 sites in the report were: weather.gov, usembassy.gov and whitehouse.gov.
 The three sites with the lowest accessibility scores were:
 mycreditunion.gov, presidio.gov (a national park site) and blm.gov (the
 Bureau of Land Management).
</p>
<p> 
 A number of high-profile federal sites also scored poorly for accessibility
 in the report. These included: trade.gov (the International Trade
 Administration), irs.gov (the Internal Revenue Service) and mymedicare.gov
 (a user portal for Medicare, a federal health insurance program for people
 over 65 and some younger people with disabilities).
</p>
<p> 
 When ranked by the overall score given across the four tested categories
 (accessibility, speed, mobile friendliness and security), the top five
 federal sites in the report were: healthdata.gov, healthfinder.gov,
 consumerfinance.gov, whitehouse.gov and usembassy.gov.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Interview.- Chad Leaman, Makers Making Change.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i188-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: The Access Makeathon:</h3>
<p>  building your own rules.</p>
<p> 
 How do you ensure that the device you’re building for someone with a
 disability is going to be genuinely useful for that person, and that it
 meets their individual needs? Simple: put that person at the centre of the
 design process and find out exactly what they want.
</p>
<p> 
 This thinking is at the root of Makers Making Change (MMC), a new project
 that connects ‘makers’ (skilled individuals or small teams building
 things on a DIY-style basis) with people with disabilities. The person with
 a disability explains a piece of equipment they need built or a problem
 they want solved, and the makers design and build something that meets
 those needs – with the disabled person involved at all stages.
</p>
<p> 
 MMC was launched by Chad Leaman and Harry Lew of the Neil Squire Society, a
 Canadian not-for-profit that focuses on giving Canadians with disabilities
 access to assistive technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 In January, Leaman and MMC organised the Access Makeathon in Vancouver. Ten
 teams of makers were paired an individual with a disability. Over one
 weekend, the teams then built an ‘access solution’ tailored to that
 individual. The results were innovative, inspiring and genuinely useful for
 the individuals at the centre of the team.
</p>
<p> 
 e-Access Bulletin spoke to Chad Leaman to learn more about the Makeathon
 and MMC.
</p>
<p> 
 - How did the idea for the Access Makeathon come about?
</p>
<p> 
 “It started about a year ago with the grant we got from Google for our
 LipSync project. This is a mouth-controlled input device that allows people
 with limited or no hand movement to control a touchscreen device. As we
 worked on making it open source – so that other people could make it as
 well – we learned that a lot of people were doing similar work around
 creating open source assistive technology projects.
</p>
<p> 
 “But our concern was that a lot of them had people making things for
 people with disabilities without talking to the people with disabilities.
 So our idea was to make the person with the disability the captain of the
 team. They’re the people that know what they need, so it put those people
 in the centre of things.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Please give an overview of exactly what happens at Access Makeathon:
</p>
<p> 
 “Over 48 hours, a person with a disability connects with a team of makers
 who will build open source assistive technology that directly addresses a
 need the person has. The goal is for each team to help a person leave the
 event with a working prototype that improves their quality of life.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Tell us about some of the projects that were built:
</p>
<p> 
 “Team Ashley created a 3D-printed, self-levelling cup attachment for the
 clutch on her wheelchair. Team Timothy built a customised Wii joystick for
 a young person who couldn’t use a standard controller.
</p>
<p> 
 “One of the simpler projects was from Team Steve. Steve wanted a way to
 hold popcorn on the side of his wheelchair, because when he goes to see a
 movie and buys popcorn, it gets spilled because he’s trying to wheel
 across the thick carpet that movie theatres have. The team built a popcorn
 holder, but they also made it into a fold-out lap tray that can be used to
 hold any meal. Some of the teams really went above and beyond.”
</p>
<p> 
 - ‘Team Jim’ was the winning team. What was their project?
</p>
<p> 
 “Jim broke his neck and has very little lung capacity due to a breathing
 issue, and his wife, Isabelle, is hearing-impaired. So Jim is unable to
 wake Isabelle if something happens to him in the night. The ‘ask’ from
 Jim to his team of makers was: ‘Make a sip-and-puff-triggered vibrating
 alarm system that can call Isabelle even is she is in a different room.’
 The team built a modified bed-shaker alarm system which can be triggered by
 a LipSync sip-and-puff device or a phone app.
</p>
<p> 
 “What struck me about the Makeathon was that a lot of makers involved
 talked about how profound the impact on them was. Some were bio-medical
 students or engineers, and some of them said they didn’t normally have
 the opportunity to use their skills in a way that would have a real impact.
</p>
<p> 
 “For the makers to see the person they were making for was really
 powerful. There’s something really magical when you put those pieces
 together, the people who are designing the solution together with the
 people who need the solution.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What are the next steps for MMC?
</p>
<p> 
 “The goal is for MMC to have two major parts. The first is to put these
 projects up on the MMC website for others to build, and release plans
 documentation all open source, so it doesn’t get lost in that one event.
</p>
<p> 
 “The second part is that we want to connect makers to people with
 disabilities. If you need a LipSync, you’ll be able to search for it or
 for makers in your area who will make one. We want viable solutions that
 really solve a need.
</p>
<p> 
 “The AT industry can be quite expensive, so we want to really try and
 provide a new way of getting AT to people who need it - especially people
 who don’t have things like a government programme or insurance provider,
 so that we can make sure that people aren’t slipping through the
 cracks.”
</p>
<p> 
 - When will people be able to get a LipSync?
</p>
<p> 
 “We have about eight with people now and the plan is to get 150 out to
 those who can benefit from them. If there’s someone out there that needs
 a LipSync due to disability constraints, I’m paying for the parts for the
 first 150 builds, so it won’t cost people anything. They can also tell me
 what they like or don’t like about it, and what they want changed. People
 can email me at the following address for more information about the
 LipSync: <a href="mailto:chadl@makersmakingchange.com">chadl@makersmakingchange.com</a> .”</p>
<p> 
 - Will there be more makeathons or other events?
</p>
<p> 
 “We recently finished a Lipsync-specific makeathon at BC Tech Summit,
 where we got 12 built. The next one is in April and we’re hoping to get
 30 more Lipsyncs built.
</p>
<p> 
 “Then the plan is to do Access Makeathon three or four more times in
 Canada over the next 12-18 months. We’re also planning to do events in
 other parts of North America, and we’d eventually like to look at hosting
 events in the UK and Europe.
</p>
<p> 
 “There’s a willingness in the field right now to look at new solutions
 and delivery models. We’re trying to position makeathons as an
 opportunity for people – a chance to make an impact, to use the tech
 skills you might have to really serve a need within your community.”
