<h3 id="i190-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: A “tax on accessible books”:</h3>
<p>  mixed emotions at Marrakesh Treaty progress.
</p>
<p> 
 The latest agreement in the process of implementing the Marrakesh Treaty,
 which aims to help end the ‘book famine’ faced by blind and visually
 impaired people, has been met with a mixture of praise and frustration.
</p>
<p> 
 The treaty aims to increase the availability of books in accessible
 formats, such as Braille and e-books, by relaxing copyright laws which make
 it difficult or time-consuming to share accessible books across different
 countries (read e-Access Bulletin’s previous coverage of the Marrakesh
 Treaty at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/6j">http://eab.li/6j</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Work on implementing the Treaty has been taking place since its initial
 adoption in 2013, and earlier this month another milestone was reached with
 an agreement between the European Parliament, the European Commission and
 the Council of the European Union.
</p>
<p> 
 The latest agreement on the text of the Treaty – currently still in draft
 form – states that accessible format books for use by blind and visually
 impaired persons can be shared across countries – as originally planned –
 and that further accessible book versions can be produced without needing
 to ask permission from the book’s copyright holder.
</p>
<p> 
 This initially seemed like a cause for celebration by the many
 organisations that have been campaigning for increased accessible book
 access. However, one aspect of the agreement has proved a cause for
 concern. Part of the agreement is a compromise, whereby EU member state
 countries can choose to ask for financial ‘compensation’ from organisations
 and libraries that distribute accessible books, in order to protect the
 interests of those that hold the copyright to the book.
</p>
<p> 
 One of many organisations unhappy at this aspect of the Treaty is the
 European Blind Union (EBU). David Hammerstein, EU advocate for the World
 Blind Union (the EBU is one of six regional bodies of the World Blind
 Union), told e-Access Bulletin that although the EBU is pleased with the
 main agreement, which represents “an important step toward ending the ‘book
 famine’” faced by visually impaired people, the EBU “actively opposes” the
 compensation element, labelling it a “tax on accessible books”.
</p>
<p> 
 Explaining the compensation aspect, Hammerstein said: “It increases costs
 for blind persons’ organisations and creates legal uncertainty for
 cross-border exchange, because book providers need to know the law in other
 countries. It also means that there will be no unified, harmonised rule in
 the European Union, creating confusion and complexity. It is false to call
 [this aspect] ‘compensation schemes’, because there is no economic loss to
 be compensated and governments have never shown any substantial damage done
 to publishers by accessible formatted works.”
</p>
<p> 
 These ‘compensation schemes’ are optional, and countries do not have to use
 them, but Hammerstein said that a number of EU member states have already
 announced their decision to try and use them.
</p>
<p> 
 To apply the compensation element, the Treaty says that there must be proof
 that distributing accessible format versions of a book causes more than
 “minimal damage” to the book’s rightsholder. In a press release on the
 decision, the EBU state that they will fight compensation schemes which do
 not present this proof: “[If this happens] we shall take legal action
 against member states for violation of this Directive and the UN Convention
 on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.”
</p>
<p> 
 A joint statement by the International Federation of Library Associations
 and the European Bureau of Library, Information and Documentation
 Associations also opposes the compensation schemes, calling it a “major
 mistake”. The statement claims that, “Such schemes will reduce the ability
 of libraries and charities to serve print disabled people … It cynically
 disregards broader social and human rights objectives and does specific
 damage to the interests of print-disabled people and the institutions that
 serve them.”
</p>
<p> 
 In order for these measures to be enforced, the European Parliament must
 approve this latest Treaty agreement in a plenary session. EU member states
 then have 12 months to “transpose the legislation into their laws,”
 Hammerstein said. Additionally, “the Council of the EU and the European
 Parliament must still ratify the Treaty,” Hammerstein said.

<h3 id="i190-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Accessible Atm App Points Users In The Right Direction.</h3>
<p> 
 A new app that helps blind and visually impaired users track down
 accessible ATMs has been launched.
</p>
<p> 
 The free LINK ATM Locator lets users search for cash machines that have a
 range of usability features, including: audio assistance; wheelchair
 access; free-to-use ATMs; &pound;5 note dispensing; mobile phone top-up
 facilities; and PIN number management.
</p>
<p> 
 The app then tells users where to find the nearest ATM based on their
 requirements and guides them to the machine through Google and Apple Maps,
 via a walking, driving or public transport route.
</p>
<p> 
 ATM network operator LINK and sight loss charity Thomas Pocklington Trust
 developed the app together after the Trust approached LINK in 2016 to
 discuss the idea. LINK confirmed that it was already looking into such an
 app and began working with the Trust.
</p>
<p> 
 Thomas Pocklington Trust then carried out user-testing with blind and
 visually impaired users, to ensure the app’s accessibility with Apple and
 Android screen-readers.
</p>
<p> 
 Mary Buffee, Head of Consumer Affairs at LINK, told e-Access Bulletin more
 about how the app works with these screen-readers: “Certain adaptations
 have been made to the app when VoiceOver or TalkBack are switched on. For
 example, a list view of ATMs is created and read aloud, starting with the
 ATM nearest to the user, as opposed to a map with icons that is displayed
 for sighted users.”
</p>
<p> 
 As well as locating their nearest ATMs, users can also search for cash
 machines in a different area and report machines that don’t work properly
 or fail to provide stated accessibility features.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about the feedback function, Buffee said: “There are a range of
 areas customers can give feedback on, from ATM location to the safety and
 security of the machines … LINK will listen to feedback from customers and
 consumer groups about the app, and will look to develop it in the future if
 there is a specific consumer need.”
</p>
<p> 
 Users can also leave positive feedback and save specific ATMs to a
 ‘favourites’ list. The LINK Locator app then alerts users when they pass a
 favourite ATM.
</p>
<p> 
 Marsha de Cordova, Engagement and Advocacy Director at Thomas Pocklington
 Trust, told e-Access Bulletin that the Trust was thrilled to work with LINK
 on the app. She said: “It is vital that technology is accessible. LINK
 involved the Trust at every stage of development, ensuring that
 accessibility remained a priority, and they have been open to all of our
 suggestions and feedback. We hope that other organisations follow in LINK’s
 footsteps to make sure apps are accessible to all.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: ‘Smart Cities’ Are Not Inclusive – But They Can Be, New Researchclaims.
</h3>
<p> 
 ‘Smart cities’ are not serving the needs of people with disabilities and
 older people, and risk deepening an existing digital divide, according to
 new, in-depth research.
</p>
<p> 
 Smart cities are loosely defined as cities that integrate digital
 technologies into their infrastructure to transform and improve the lives
 of citizens and landscapes.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2016, G3ict (the Global Initiative for Inclusive ICTs) and non-profit
 initiative World Enabled (which works to protect the rights of people with
 disabilities) launched a research project to assess ICT accessibility in
 smart cities around the world. Over 250 experts and smart city program
 managers were surveyed and interviewed, with around 60% claiming that smart
 cities were failing people with disabilities. Only 18% of respondents knew
 of a smart city that uses ICT accessibility standards
</p>
<p> 
 As a result of the findings, G3ict and World Enabled have just launched a
 Smart Cities for All Toolkit, featuring four digital tools to help those
 involved in city planning to make future technology projects more
 inclusive.
</p>
<p> 
 James Thurston, Vice President for Global Strategy and Development at
 G3ict, told e-Access Bulletin that the toolkit was developed specifically
 to address the key barriers to digital inclusion within smart cities. He
 said: “Smart cities are positioning themselves as more competitive, more
 inclusive, and more ‘liveable.’ However, we want to make sure that they
 don’t leave our one out of seven city residents that may live with a
 disability.”
</p>
<p> 
 Dr. Victor Pineda, President and Founder of World Enabled, told e-Access
 Bulletin about some of the biggest barriers that people with disabilities
 and older people face in smart cities projects: “User interface is a big
 problem, but so is the lack of data being generated on or by persons with
 disabilities. Both are problems we know must be addressed.”
</p>
<p> 
 The Smart Cities for All toolkit contains the following documents: a guide
 to implementing priority ICT accessibility standards; a guide to adopting
 an ICT accessibility procurement policy; advice on communicating the case
 for stronger commitment to digital inclusion in cities; and, a database of
 solutions for digital inclusion in cities.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr. Pineda explained how these tools can be used to increase digital
 inclusion within cities: “We created a communications tool to help city
 leaders promote or upsell digital accessibility within the IT departments
 and generate more buy-in for digital inclusion and accessibility.  This
 tool helps make the case for digital inclusion from both a human rights and
 a business perspective.”
</p>
<p> 
 Crucially, smart cities and the technologies used in them represent a huge
 opportunity to benefit citizens with disabilities and older citizens.
 “There is no reason why the newly built digital infrastructure cities are
 deploying should be leaving people behind,” Dr. Pineda said.
</p>
<p> 
 A summary of the research on the G3ict site further explains how smart city
 digital services can be made more accessible: “Content can be made
 available in multiple formats and languages, services can be offered
 remotely to home-bound or geographically isolated citizens, digital formats
 can serve multiple disabilities, and interact with a broad range of
 assistive technologies.”
</p>
<p> 
 The next steps for the project involve building a ‘digital inclusion
 maturity model’. Thurston said: “With this new tool, cities will be able to
 assess where they currently stand on ICT accessibility and digital
 inclusion and then build a roadmap for improvement.”
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, the tools are being translated into different languages to
 allow increased use across the world. “Just recently we released the tools
 in Portuguese because we see so much innovative work on smart cities in
 Brazil and Portugal,” Dr. Pineda said.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Keeping The Public Sector Accessible.</h3>
<p> 
 By Carine Marzin.
</p>
<p> 
 The EU directive on making the websites and mobile apps of public sector
 bodies more accessible was adopted at the end of 2016 and is the very first
 piece of EU legislation on digital accessibility. It will benefit over 500
 million European citizens, including an estimated 80 million Europeans
 living with a disability, by making digital content from the public sector
 across Europe more accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Governments will have to check that public sector bodies consistently
 adhere to the accessibility standards and there will be a new enforcement
 procedure, making it easier for members of the public to complain about
 inaccessible content and get the situation resolved.
</p>
<p> 
 (For background information on the directive, read e-Access Bulletin’s
 coverage in previous issues at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/6k">http://eab.li/6k</a>
 .)</p>
<p> 
 This is a ‘minimum harmonisation’ directive, setting out minimum
 accessibility requirements for websites and mobile apps that all public
 sector bodies in all 28 EU member states must meet. Governments are able
 and encouraged to go above and beyond these minimum requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 - When will the directive be in force?
</p>
<p> 
 The directive has to be transposed into national law in all EU member
 states by September 23, 2018. All websites created after that date will
 have to be accessible by September 23, 2019. Existing websites will have to
 comply by September 23, 2020. All mobile applications will have to be
 accessible by June 23, 2021.
</p>
<p> 
 The directive applies to state, regional and local authorities, but also to
 bodies ‘governed by public law’ such as hospitals or universities.
 Importantly, governments can extend the accessibility requirements in the
 directive to private companies offering facilities and services to the
 public, such as transport, utilities, electronic communication services and
 postal services.
</p>
<p> 
 - Accessibility requirements and exemptions.
</p>
<p> 
 The European Commission will publish the technical specifications that
 public sector bodies will have to meet by December 23, 2018. In the
 meantime, the public sector will need to comply with clauses from an
 existing European standard on procuring accessible ICT.
</p>
<p> 
 The directive does not apply to websites and mobile applications of public
 service broadcasters and their subsidiaries.
</p>
<p> 
 Some types of content are temporarily excluded from the scope of the
 directive if they are not needed for administrative processes. Examples
 include: office file formats (such as PDF documents) published before
 September 23, 2018; pre-recorded time-based media (such as audio-only and
 video-only) if published before September 23, 2020; and the content of
 archived websites. However, public sector bodies will still have to make
 this content accessible on request.
</p>
<p> 
 Content of extranets and intranets published before September 23, 2019 is
 also excluded from the new accessibility directive, unless a substantial
 revision of the systems takes place.
</p>
<p> 
 Permanent exclusions to the directive include live, time-based media, plus
 online maps and mapping services (as long as essential information is
 provided, such as a postal address or information about nearby public
 transport). Other exclusions include some third-party content. For example,
 user-generated content, such as a photo without alternative text or a video
 without captions posted on a forum – these examples would both be exempt
 from the directive’s accessibility requirements, but the forum itself would
 have to be accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The directive also includes a provision explaining that delivering
 accessibility requirements should not impose a “disproportionate burden”
 for public sector bodies. However, the right to invoke this principle is
 limited. For example, lack of priority, time or knowledge will not be
 accepted as legitimate reasons.
</p>
<p> 
 It is important to note that the requirements in this directive are in
 addition to accessibility requirements in the United Nations Convention on
 the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as requirements introduced
 by new EU legislation on public procurement in 2016. The latter of these
 makes accessibility a mandatory criterion for all public procurement
 intended for use by the general public, or staff of any contracting
 authority, and is a powerful lever to deliver more accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 - Keeping updated and public feedback.
</p>
<p> 
 Governments will have to ensure that public sector bodies provide and
 regularly update a detailed, comprehensive and clear accessibility
 statement on their websites and mobile applications. Furthermore, a
 feedback mechanism will enable anyone to notify a public sector
 organisation if a website or mobile application is inaccessible, and to
 request accessible content instead. Public sector bodies will be required
 to give an “adequate response” to these notifications or requests “within a
 reasonable period of time,” as well as providing information about the
 enforcement procedure.
</p>
<p> 
 - Enforcement.
</p>
<p> 
 Governments have to ensure that there is an “adequate and effective
 enforcement procedure” for the directive – this will be defined at national
 level. Governments will also have to designate a national authority to
 monitor and enforce the new rules. In many countries, such as the UK, going
 to court was, until now, the only way to seek a solution to inaccessible
 public sector digital content, and for most people, the cost of litigation
 was a barrier. The new enforcement procedure will give everyone an
 alternative, non-judicial avenue to seek a solution, by submitting
 complaints to a national authority.
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, governments will have to promote and facilitate training
 programmes on website and mobile app accessibility for relevant
 stakeholders. Governments will also monitor compliance with the
 accessibility requirements in the directive. Experts are currently working
 with the European Commission to develop a monitoring methodology.
