<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Evolving Technologies Won’T Automatically Empower People, Saysparalympian.
</h3>
<p> 
 Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence have huge potential
 to empower assistive technology users, but we cannot simply wait for this
 to happen, a renowned Paralympian and member of the House of Lords has
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 In an opening speech at the Assistive Technology Exhibition and
 Conference (ATEC) in London earlier this month, Lord Chris Holmes told
 delegates that these technologies must be harnessed in the right way.
</p>
<p> 
 Using the ‘Internet of Things’, artificial intelligence, ‘big data’ and
 robotics as examples, Holmes said: “All of these technologies are neutral
 when it comes to accessibility. They can have such a transformative
 impact, but it won’t just happen as a matter of course. They could just
 exacerbate existing patterns and structures of exclusion.”
</p>
<p> 
 Holmes claimed that technology provides a “phenomenal opportunity” to
 enable people in education, employment and through social inclusion, but
 also that these processes will not just evolve automatically. He said:
 “It’s as much down to politicians, policy-makers and government to lead
 on so much of this if we’re going to realise the opportunities that
 exist.”
</p>
<p> 
 Holmes also revealed that the newly formed All-Party Parliamentary Group
 for Assistive Technology (APPGAT – read more in e-Access Bulletin’s
 previous APPGAT coverage: <a href="http://eab.li/6v">http://eab.li/6v</a>
 ) will soon be launching its first enquiry. Holmes, who is a co-chair of the group, said it would be
 “a great focal point for parliamentarians from all parties, a chance for
 them to focus on getting people into [assistive technology] who’ve never
 considered it.”
</p>
<p> 
 During his time as an athlete, Holmes won 15 Paralympic medals for
 swimming, nine of them gold. In his speech to ATEC delegates in London,
 he discussed the evolution of assistive technology and how it provided an
 invaluable lifeline to him growing up and in his swimming training, after
 he suddenly and unexpectedly lost his sight at 14-years-old.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Holmes
 explained how in-ear audio description devices designed for visually
 impaired spectators quickly became popular with all visitors,
 demonstrating the benefits of universal design. Accessibility and
 inclusion were “hardwired” throughout the 2012 games, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 This kind of innovative thinking will continue at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic
 and Paralympic Games, said Holmes, who visited technology labs in Tokyo
 to find out more about accessibility measures at the event. Holmes said:
 “What they’re currently working on and what will be showcased and
 rolled-out in 2020 will be quite sensational. In terms of mobility,
 communication, translation and every element of the games – it’s not just
 technology that’s being thought of, but assistive technology.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Research Uncovers ‘The Real Digital Divide’ Facing Millions Inthe Uk.
</h3>
<p> 
 Fresh data has shown further evidence of the digital gulf in the UK
 facing millions of people with disabilities and older people.
</p>
<p> 
 A report by digital inclusion charity Good Things Foundation and
 Professor Simeon Yates, titled ‘The real digital divide?’, examines the
 demographics of people in the UK who never or rarely use the internet.
 The report is based on (and builds on) a 2015 report from
 telecommunications regulatory body Ofcom on ‘Adults’ media use and
 attitudes’.
</p>
<p> 
 In terms of usage, the research found that 15.2 million people in the UK
 were found to be either ‘non-users’ (defined as people who have no
 internet access or don’t use the internet even if they have access) or
 ‘limited users’ (people who rarely and infrequently go online).
</p>
<p> 
 47.7% of the ‘non-user’ group were found to have “a long-standing
 illness, disability or infirmity,” representing around 3.7 million people
 in the UK. This compares to previous data from the Office for National
 Statistics, which found that 22% of disabled adults in the UK have never
 used the internet.
</p>
<p> 
 Age was also a key factor in non-use. 64.4% of non-users in the report
 are aged 65 or over, with 25.3% aged between 65-74 and 39.1% aged over
 75.
</p>
<p> 
 Looking at the ‘limited users’ group, 47.4% reported having a disability
 or poor health, representing 3.5 million people. The report also state
 that: “Age is again a clear indicator of limited use, although not quite
 as marked as for non-users.” 18.5% of the ‘limited users’ group are aged
 65-74, and 18.8% of the group are aged over 75.
</p>
<p> 
 Tom French, Research and Data Manager at Good Things Foundation, who led
 the report writing, told e-Access Bulletin that further work is necessary
 to explore the reasons behind non or limited internet use among people
 with disabilities and older people. He said: “We need to commit to
 exploring this link so that we can influence government and digital
 leaders to truly embrace accessibility.”
</p>
<p> 
 Discussing what can be done to increase internet usage among these
 groups, French said: “Sustained support at a trusted community and peer
 level is essential. We recognise that basic digital skills pave the way
 for internet use, but we need to ensure that all types of use are catered
 for and that we support people to take advantage of the full breadth of
 benefits … The key finding [from the report] for us is that digital
 exclusion needs to be redefined as the digital landscape evolves, and is
 much, much wider than simply assessing whether someone has access to the
 internet (or devices) and whether they have online skills.”

<p> 
 A guide on recruitment and digital accessibility has been released,
 aiming to help companies and organisations ensure that their digital
 resources are inclusive for all applicants when searching and applying
 for jobs.
</p>
<p> 
 The Accessible Recruitment Guide has been produced by Media Access
 Australia, a non-profit digital accessibility organisation. Designed
 primarily for HR staff, the guide aims to offer “real world guidance” on
 digital recruitment resources.
</p>
<p> 
 A ‘digital accessibility checklist’ in the guide suggests a number of
 areas to consider, which will benefit applicants with a wide range of
 impairments, including those who are blind or visually impaired, and
 those who are deaf. These areas include: accessible document templates;
 requesting knowledge of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
 2.0 for roles involving content creation; advertising jobs through
 accessible websites, intranets and social media platforms; and providing
 an online audiovisual alternative to telephone interviews, such as Skype.
</p>
<p> 
 There are also tips on making recruitment videos accessible, such as
 adding captions and audio description.
</p>
<p> 
 To ensure that these measures are effective and that the recruitment
 process is a fully inclusive one, the guide suggests undertaking
 user-testing with users that have a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The final section of the guide lists other useful tools for recruiters,
 including several Media Access Australia resources (guides on social
 media accessibility and accessible technology in the workplace) and a
 ‘colour contrast analyser’ from accessibility consultancy The Paciello
 Group.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: European report. - The European e-Accessibility Forum.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Opening Up Digital Culture.</h3>
<p> 
 Just as digital accessibility picks up more and more mainstream interest,
 certain topics within the accessibility field also begin gathering
 momentum. One such topic is accessible culture. Clearly, this can mean
 many things, but in this case it refers to cultural spaces (such as
 museums and art galleries), projects and resources being made more
 inclusive through digital technology.
</p>
<p> 
 For some people, this has already been a focal point for years, perhaps
 through employment, personal interest or just frustration at the lack of
 accessibility within these areas.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this month, the eleventh European e-Accessibility Forum sought to
 explore this vast subject with its theme of ‘e-accessible culture’. Held
 in Paris at the Cité des sciences et de l’Industrie, the event was
 organised by French non-profit BrailleNet, an organisation that works
 towards improving digital accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 BrailleNet’s director Alex Bernier was one of the speakers, alongside a
 host of other accessibility professionals and representatives from
 various cultural institutions.
</p>
<p> 
 Here is e-Access Bulletin’s report from the Forum, covering talks and
 workshops from across the event.
</p>
<p> 
 In a session entitled ‘Building inclusive cultural services from the
 bottom up’, Sandrine Sophys-Veret from the French Ministry of Culture and
 Communication spoke about the Ministry’s efforts to increase cultural
 access through technology.
</p>
<p> 
 One example given was a robotic device being trialled. These devices help
 visitors with a mobility impairment view exhibits on inaccessible floors
 in museums or galleries. Visitors control the robot remotely from a
 different floor and view a video feed from a camera attached to the
 robot.
</p>
<p> 
 Future projects from the Ministry include an ‘accessibility barometer’ to
 measure the online accessibility levels of arts and culture websites, and
 a ‘hackathon’ to inspire new cultural projects.
</p>
<p> 
 Sophys-Veret explained that in the Ministry’s efforts to help create a
 “universal and inclusive” society, “no single tool can be the response.”
 She also spoke about accessible books, stating that “access to [these]
 books is a colossal issue.”
</p>
<p> 
 Exploring this theme in more depth were Jesper Klein (from the Swedish
 Agency for Accessible Media and the DAISY Consortium) and Alex Bernier,
 Director of BrailleNet.
</p>
<p> 
 Klein spoke about ‘Producing and distributing accessible e-books: the
 Swedish model’. He began by talking about the ‘book famine’, referring to
 the severe lack of accessible format books for people with print
 disabilities. Although reading is still an important and popular cultural
 activity, over 90% of all printed materials are not available in
 accessible formats, Klein said.
</p>
<p> 
 The DAISY Consortium has been working to end the book famine, and after
 exploring some of the Consortium’s work, Klein spoke about Legimus, a
 Swedish digital library and app that serves people with print
 disabilities. Legimus has 120,000 accessible books and 75,000 active
 users in Sweden.
</p>
<p> 
 He said that although the core principles behind accessible reading
 (people with a print disability should be able to read the same titles as
 anyone else, at the same time, through the same distribution channels and
 at the same costs) have not been achieved yet, new technologies are
 making a lot of progress.
</p>
<p> 
 Klein said: “The tide is turning. Inclusion of people with print
 disabilities and accessible reading are moving into the mainstream,
 fast.” He finished by predicting that libraries serving people with print
 disabilities will offer more specialised services and titles in future,
 as mainstream outlets will begin offering well-known and popular books in
 accessible formats.
</p>
<p> 
 Alex Bernier spoke about the emergence of accessible publishing,
 including OPALINe, a project that aims to drive forward the production of
 accessible format books. He also presented some of the issues facing the
 industry.
</p>
<p> 
 Bernier said: “The industry receives very little financial support and it
 is fragmented. We have to find new ways to cooperate.” Replication of
 labour is also a problem, he said: “In France, a lot of the same books
 are being adapted [for accessible formats], especially schoolbooks.”
 Bernier claimed that a new collaborative publishing platform is being
 developed to tackle this issue. The tool will help divide up and record
 work, to avoid repetition.
</p>
<p> 
 Elsewhere, a session on ‘celebrating diversity and driving creativity
 through digital technologies’ unearthed some fantastic innovations.
 Gawain Hewitt of Drake Music spoke about the organisation’s experimental
 musical instrument design with disabled musicians, using the example of
 the Mi.Mu Gloves, a wearable musical technology that offers the wearer a
 range of control and production tools.
</p>
<p> 
 The Mi.Mu Gloves proved invaluable to Kris Halpin, a disabled musician
 that Hewitt and Drake Music had been working with, giving Halpin “a new
 lease of performing life,” Hewitt said.
</p>
<p> 
 Similarly, Hewitt helped James Rose – a conductor with limited mobility
 who conducts primarily by moving his head – with a new design for his
 conducting baton, by ‘hacking’ a pair Rose’s glasses and attaching a
 baton and electrical fitting to the side of the glasses.
</p>
<p> 
 “Good design can remove the barriers faced by disabled musicians and
 allow them to succeed on their own terms,” Hewitt said.
</p>
<p> 
 An afternoon session titled ‘From the visual to the textual – describing
 the arts in a digital world’ featured Lauren Trimble from ITHAKA, a
 non-profit platform that hosts digital academic databases. Trimble
 explained how some of these databases have been building accessibility
 into their digital archives.
</p>
<p> 
 One example used was JSTOR, a cloud-based library hosting journals,
 books, images and other content. Trimble explained that improving JSTOR’s
 accessibility meant meeting WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines) 2.0 requirements – a process which Trimble had long
 understood the benefits of, and helped steer JSTOR towards achieving.
 JSTOR is now rated at level ‘AA’ for WCAG compliance and has developed a
 process for fixing archived content that was previously inaccessible for
 visually impaired users.
</p>
<p> 
 Trimble concluded with the following observations: “We should be making
 decisions from the user’s perspective, as opposed to what we think the
 user should want or need. If it turns out that anything we try is not
 best serving the intended community, we’ll go where that community is and
 make our products better from their perspective.”
</p>
<p> 
 Following on was Matthew Cock, CEO of the VocalEyes charity, which
 provides audio description services in theatres, museums and galleries.
 He discussed a VocalEyes project that audited 1,700 UK museum websites,
 to examine the online access information provided on these sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Cock explained that the study was based on the theory that a lack of
 access information for disabled visitors will mean lower attendance at
 that museum. He said: “Using a website is a vital step in the
 decision-making process for many people. Without answers to key access
 questions beforehand, people are less likely to visit.”
</p>
<p> 
 The study found that 27% of UK museums have no access information on
 their website, and a further 43% have some access information, but make
 no mention of visually impaired people. “That’s 70% of museums that are
 not catering for blind or partially sighted people,” Cock said.
</p>
<p> 
 Reflecting on the forum after a day of thought-provoking talks, it seems
 that e-accessible culture is finally being pushed, gradually, into the
 spotlight. Though some sessions uncovered a worrying lack of accessible
 cultural practices, suggestions and solutions were also offered to
 attempt to fix the situation.
</p>
<p> 
 Sometimes these solutions were based around innovative new technologies,
 sometimes simply through better use of existing technologies. Either way,
 let’s hope these solutions are taken on board, fully opening up cultural
 spaces, projects and resources to a far wider audience.
