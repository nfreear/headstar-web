<h3 id="i193-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Gaming Industry Takes One Special Day Out To Raise £100,000.</h3>
<p>
 The video games industry is being asked to raise &pound;100,000 in a single day
 later this month, to boost and support the number of gamers with
 disabilities.
</p>
<p>
 Organised by gaming charity SpecialEffect, the One Special Day
 fundraising project takes place on September 29. The organisers are
 asking developers and other companies from across the video games
 industry to donate revenue from games sales and in-app purchases on the
 day.
</p>
<p>
 Mark Saville from SpecialEffect told e-Access Bulletin that the idea for
 One Special Day came from a mobile games developer, who saw how much
 industry support was given to the ICAP Charity Day, where financial
 services company ICAP donated all revenue for one day to selected
 charities. Out of a desire to replicate this success for gamers with
 disabilities, One Special Day was born.
</p>
<p>
 So far, over 40 companies are partnering the event, raising funds through
 donations and all kinds of other activities, such as bake sales, said
 Saville.
</p>
<p>
 Companies can also donate prizes for a fundraising auction that takes
 place on the day. Prizes include VIP tours of top gaming studios and the
 chance for one winner to have a character from a game modelled on them.
</p>
<p>
 Saville said that SpecialEffect are hopeful of raising the target amount
 of &pound;100,000. Asked how the funds will be used to support gamers with
 disabilities, he said: “The money raised will be spent on supporting our
 core work, visiting and supporting gamers with disabilities across the UK
 and loaning specialist equipment.”
</p>
<p>
 Saville continued: “A great example is Marley, who uses four chin
 joysticks to play his games. A spinal injury affects movement below his
 neck, but he’s got great head movement. We set up three chin-controlled
 joysticks for him and with the addition of some custom voice controls,
 he’s started playing ‘World of Warcraft’ again. We want people to play to
 the very, very best of their abilities.”

<h3 id="i193-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Google Maps Calls On Millions Of Users To Boost Access Info.</h3>
<p>
 The Google Maps team has requested its extensive user community help
 improve its accessibility listings.
</p>
<p>
 As reported in previous issues of e-Access Bulletin, Google has taken
 various steps to increase its accessibility offerings in maps during
 previous months (see e-Access Bulletin December 2016: <a href="http://eab.li/7v">http://eab.li/7v</a>
 ) ( <a href="http://headstar.com/eablive/?p=1278">http://headstar.com/eablive/?p=1278</a>
 ). Now, however, the Google Maps team have explicitly asked that its ‘Local Guides’ – a community of
 millions of users who voluntarily collect data – proactively add in
 wheelchair-accessible location information to maps.
</p>
<p>
 As the Local Guides system works primarily by users answering questions
 (these questions help gather new data sets that help improve maps), the
 following calculation is made on a Google blog post announcing the
 call-out:
</p>
<p>
 “If each of our tens of millions of Local Guides answers three of these
 questions [about wheelchair-accessible locations] every day for two
 weeks, we can gather nearly two billion answers to help people who rely
 on this information every day.”
</p>
<p>
 The blog post was written by Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, a software engineer
 for the Google Maps, Content and Community team, who also uses a
 wheelchair. Read the Google blog post in full at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/7w">http://eab.li/7w</a>
 . ( https://www.blog.google/products/maps/better-world-wheels-google-maps/ )
</p>
<p>
 As Blair-Goldensohn points out in the post: “Because anyone can identify
 and label wheelchair-friendly locations directly on [a Google Map], it’s
 easy to share this knowledge around the world. But not everyone knows
 this tool exists.”
</p>
<p>
 The post then lets readers know how to add in this information: “First,
 make sure your Google Maps Location History is turned on. Then visit
 ‘Your contributions’ in the upper-left menu, tap ‘Answer questions about
 a place,’ and indicate whether businesses you’ve visited are
 wheelchair-friendly.”
</p>
<p>
 Those using devices on the Android operating system can also search for
 nearby areas around them that don’t have this accessibility info, so that
 it can be added.

<h3 id="i193-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Global Committee Comes To The Uk In New Inclusive Tech Event.</h3>
<p>
 The UK chapter of an international accessibility organisation will
 formally launch at a new conference in London in November.
</p>
<p>
 The TechShare Pro conference will host the introduction of the UK branch
 of the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP),
 alongside a programme of talks, workshops and activities on digital
 inclusivity.
</p>
<p>
 Founded in the United States in 2014, IAAP is a non-profit membership
 group that aims to help embed accessible products, services and content
 globally, by supporting individuals and organisations wanting to improve
 their accessibility. It became part of G3ict (the Global Initiative for
 Inclusive ICTs) in 2016, and the new UK branch was founded by technology
 inclusion charity AbilityNet, Barclays, Lloyds, TextHelp and IT services
 company Atos.
</p>
<p>
 Speaking to e-Access Bulletin about this new development, Nigel Lewis,
 CEO of AbilityNet and co-founder of the UK Chapter of IAAP, said: “The
 IAAP brings accessibility experts together to define, promote and improve
 the accessibility profession through networking, education and
 certification. We’re launching our UK Chapter at TechShare Pro as the
 conference is aimed specifically at digital accessibility and UX
 professionals – it’s the perfect platform for us to talk about the
 professionalisation of digital accessibility.”
</p>
<p>
 TechShare Pro is a new event that has evolved from the TechShare Europe
 events organised by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)
 in previous years. The new conference is organised by RNIB and
 AbilityNet.
</p>
<p>
 The event will explore how digital products and services are being
 designed to become more inclusive, both for people with disabilities and
 in a wider sense for all users.
</p>
<p>
 A range of topics will be covered at the conference, but there will be a
 focus on how evolving technologies are increasing opportunities for
 accessibility, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented
 and virtual reality.
</p>
<p>
 Speakers announced so far include representatives from Google, O2, Orcam
 and Microsoft. O2 will be discussing voice-driven media players with
 RNIB, Google will be talking about how smart home developments can
 potentially aid independent living, and Orcam will be exploring wearable
 technologies and using the Amazon Echo for accessibility purposes.
 Microsoft will be leading an ‘inclusive hack’ throughout the conference.
</p>
<p>
 Further speakers and a full programme will be announced nearer the event.
</p>
<p>
 TechShare Pro takes place on November 23 at IBM’s office in South Bank,
 London. Tickets cost &pound;150 or &pound;75 for those from non-profit organisations.

<h3 id="i193-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Age is No Barrier:</h3>
<p>  Smartphone use among older people (in this case classed as 55-75 year olds) increased by 42 per cent over the last five
 years, new research has found. The ‘State of the smart’ report, conducted
 by Deloitte, also found that while ‘over-usage’ of smartphones among
 older people was much lower than in younger age groups, one in eight
 65-75 year olds believed they used their smartphone ‘excessively’.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Interview. – Matthew Cock, VocalEyes chief executive.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i193-06"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Opening Up The Arts.</h3>
<p>
 Matthew Cock is the chief executive of VocalEyes, a charity that works to
 make the arts more inclusive for people with disabilities, primarily
 through audio description services at theatres around the UK. He helped
 lead VocalEyes’ work on State of Museum Access, a report that delved deep
 if and how 1,700 UK museums publicised their access information online.
</p>
<p>
 Matthew is also one of the organisers of the Jodi Awards. This annual
 event celebrates positive use of technology to widen access to
 information and resources in museums, libraries and other cultural
 organisations for people with disabilities. E-Access Bulletin caught up
 with Matthew to find out more.
</p>
<p>
 - Tell us more about VocalEyes’ work:
</p>
<p>
 “VocalEyes delivers live audio description for around 180 theatre
 performances each year, for between 80 and 100 UK theatres. We also
 audio-describe opera and dance, open-air theatre, circus and even
 fireworks displays.”
</p>
<p>
 “We work with around 30-40 museums on different projects each year –
 training staff in visual awareness, guiding and the skill of audio
 description, so that the museum can programme audio-described tours of
 their exhibitions and galleries.”
</p>
<p>
 “We’ve recently expanded our offer into producing large print descriptive
 guides and tactile drawings with Braille. We also support arts venues in
 attracting blind and partially sighted audiences, including through a
 free listings service on our website that any arts organisation can use
 to publicise their audio-described event.”
</p>
<p>
 - How have audio description services in the arts and cultural sectors
 changed or improved over the years?
</p>
<p>
 “I think that museums have become more aware of the broader context of
 the visitor experience, and more specifically for disabled visitors.
 VocalEyes did some research in 2009 that has informed our offer since –
 museums not only need support developing audio-descriptive skills, but
 also designing the events and an overall programme, marketing and
 ensuring front of house and other staff are trained in awareness and are
 knowledgeable about the museum’s access offer.”
</p>
<p>
 - Tell us more about the Jodi Awards:
</p>
<p>
 “Through championing and celebrating best practice initiatives and
 projects, we promote barrier-free access to cultural collections for
 disabled people. The panel of judges take a holistic approach, assessing
 projects and the organisation in multiple ways.”
</p>
<p>
 - What institutions have been previous winners of Jodi Awards?
</p>
<p>
 “Previous winners range from large national museums and organisations –
 such as the British Museum and Tate Modern – to smaller local museum and
 library services around the UK, such as Hampshire and Leeds. We’ve also
 had inspirational winners from across the world, including Berlin für
 Blinde in Germany, the Sign Language eLibrary of Finland and the Canadian
 Museum of Human Rights. The most recent winner is the Roald Dahl Museum
 and Story Centre (in England) for their work with Signly, delivering
 smart BSL-signed content directly to the user’s device.”
</p>
<p>
 - How did the State of Museum Access report come about?
</p>
<p>
 “We know that there is lots of good practice and fantastic resources
 around the country, but there was no overall picture of what access
 information and resources museums offered. We undertook the report so
 that we could use it as a benchmark to campaign for improvements in the
 sector, and do more to bring to an end the exclusion of disabled people
 from museums.”
</p>
<p>
 - How was the work carried out?
</p>
<p>
 “A group of volunteers visited the website of around 100 museums each to
 find its access information (or not), and completed an audit on what was
 covered or not. It wasn’t an audit of the website’s technical
 accessibility, we simply followed the route that most members of the
 public do when planning a cultural trip – and our report is based on that
 premise: if a museum doesn’t address access barriers or promote access
 resources on their website, they may as well not have them at the museum
 itself, because people will decide not to visit. Lack of good information
 online effectively excludes disabled people.”
</p>
<p>
 - What were the findings?
</p>
<p>
 “Overall, 27% of UK museums provide no access information on their
 website for disabled visitors planning a visit. Only 30% of UK museums
 provide information on their website that would be useful for a blind or
 partially-sighted person. And when it comes to specific resources that
 they could use, the figures are even worse: only 18% publicised labels or
 information for their exhibits in large print, and only 10% publicise
 live audio-described tours and handling sessions.”
</p>
<p>
 - How can museums and other cultural spaces go about improving their
 accessibility offerings if they don’t know where to start?
</p>
<p>
 “Ask the community. Set up an access panel of disabled people; get in
 touch with local groups and invite them in. Ask them to use your website,
 and take a tour around your museum with you. There are also some amazing
 community sites in DisabledGo.com and Euan’s Guide, which have access
 audits and reviews.”
</p>
<p>
 - What emerging technology in the arts and culture will become important
 areas for accessibility developments?
</p>
<p>
 “Chatbots and the underpinning AI engines present an amazing opportunity
 for museums to engage with audiences, and I believe could be a fantastic
 way for reassuring visitors that their access needs will be met, and what
 resources or events might be available for their visit. The chatbots
 could be in text or voice format, offering accessible alternatives for a
 wide range of users.
</p>
<p>
 “Secondly, virtual and augmented reality. We need to ensure that as with
 all formats, they are developed with inclusive and creative approaches.
 It’s an incredibly exciting area – marrying three-dimensional sound tech
 with VR – and an amazing challenge and opportunity for AD (audio, or
 verbal description).
</p>
<p>
 “However, while new technology changes the landscape all the time, we
 mustn’t forget that millions of regular images of museum objects and
 artworks online still lack descriptions that can open them up for blind
 and partially sighted people, something that is only being addressed by a
 handful of museums across the world. A project developed by the Museum of
 Contemporary Art in Chicago called Coyote could be the model that enables
 this to change, at scale.”
