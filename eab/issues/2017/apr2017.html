<h3 id="i189-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Age Doesn’T Bridge The Digital Skills Chasm, New Research Reveals.</h3>
<p> 
 Americans with disabilities are using technology at a lower rate than those
 without a disability – including teenagers and younger citizens –
 research has found.
</p>
<p> 
 In the report, conducted by the United States-based Pew Research Center
 (which defines itself as a “nonpartisan fact tank”), those with
 disabilities in the two age groups measured (18-64 and over 65) showed
 similarly low levels of technology ownership, compared to those without
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 67% of respondents with a disability aged 18-64 owned a desktop computer or
 laptop, compared to 84% of people without a disability – a difference of
 17%. In the ‘over 65’ group, this difference figure was 16%.
</p>
<p> 
 Similarly, 70% of disabled respondents aged 18-64 owned a smartphone,
 compared to 87% of those without a disability – a difference of 17%
 again. For those aged over 65, the difference was 13%.
</p>
<p> 
 To give some context to these findings, the report explains that “the
 disabled population” is disproportionately comprised of seniors, an age
 group which has lower levels of digital adoption than the rest of the
 United States. However, despite the fact that younger disabled Americans
 are more likely to have home broadband and own digital devices, this group
 is still much less likely to use digital technology than those without
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The report also found that adults with a disability are less likely to own
 multiple digital devices that allow them to get online. The report states:
 “One-in-four disabled adults say they have high-speed internet at home, a
 smartphone, a desktop or laptop computer and a tablet, compared with 42% of
 those who report not having a disability.”
</p>
<p> 
 Another key finding from the report was that Americans with disabilities
 are almost three times more likely to say they never go online as those
 without a disability: 23% compared with 8%.
</p>
<p> 
 These results are based on two surveys conducted by Pew in 2016. At that
 time, figures from the Census Bureau claimed 16% of adults reported living
 with a disability – defined in the research as a “health problem,
 disability or handicap currently keeping you from participating fully in
 work, school, housework or other activities.” That number is now
 estimated to be 19%. As the Pew research points out, “It is important to
 note that there are various forms of disabilities, often ranging in
 severity, so this question is meant to be a broad look at disabled
 Americans.”

<h3 id="i189-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Countdown To The Uk Release Of The First Braille Smartwatch.</h3>
<p> 
 The first Braille smartwatch for visually impaired people is planned to be
 shipped out to customers in May, after initially taking around 140,000
 orders from customers around the world.
</p>
<p> 
 The Dot Watch lets users read messages through four Braille characters on
 the watch face. It connects to a user’s phone via Bluetooth and can then
 receive messages and notifications from services and apps on the phone,
 such as WhatsApp, Google Maps or traditional SMS texts.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can send messages, scroll through notifications and switch between
 functions using two buttons and a dial on the side of the device. As well
 as featuring traditional watch functions (such as a stopwatch and alarm),
 the Dot device also alerts users to incoming phone calls and lets them know
 who is calling.
</p>
<p> 
 The Dot Watch was designed by South Korean technology startup Dot, founded
 by Eric Kim. The device has been in development for several years, and has
 gone through various changes and improvements after being tested by
 visually impaired users.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the watch is available to pre-order, it has not yet been publicly
 released or shipped out in the UK, as further testing is still taking
 place. Alex Lee, Sales and Marketing Director at Dot, told e-Access
 Bulletin that the company is “awaiting further beta test feedback from
 various institutions and individuals from across the globe” before
 confirming an exact release date, but said that Dot is working towards
 shipping watches to customers in mid-late May.
</p>
<p> 
 Lee said that pricing for the Dot Watch in the UK will be &quot;starting from
 &pound;350 and subject to changes pending software and hardware improvements
 before release.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about other future Dot projects, Lee said that other “lifestyle
 improvements for the vision-impaired and deafblind communities” were
 being explored. Lee claimed that the cell technology used in the Dot Watch
 is leading the company towards a ‘full-fledged tablet-like device that
 will be our next flagship project.”

<h3 id="i189-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Let’S Educate The Supply Chain, Says Barclays Head Of Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Suppliers to businesses often struggle with the concept of accessibility,
 particularly when providing technology products and services, the head of
 accessibility at a major UK bank told delegates at a recent event.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at a technology-focused session at the Business Disability Forum
 (BDF) Conference on ‘Disability-smart suppliers and partners’, Paul
 Smyth – head of accessibility at Barclays – said that there is a need
 for businesses to explain the principles behind accessibility to their
 suppliers: “[Suppliers] are new to accessibility, so we need to spend a
 lot of time talking about the ‘why’, what we mean by accessibility and
 about why it’s important to us.”
</p>
<p> 
 One reason for this was a lack of understanding of accessibility
 requirements, Smyth said, citing the widely used Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG) as an example. He said: “[WCAG] is very long and
 technical. ‘Techies’ understand it, but salespeople and suppliers
 don’t, project managers and business people don’t. So [Barclays] has
 spent a lot of time re-engineering and creating better summaries, to create
 a consistent understanding [for those people].”
</p>
<p> 
 Smyth also said that accessibility is often still seen as a hassle by some,
 who meet minimum accessibility requirements out of obligation, and little
 more: “I think that in the tech space, accessibility has got a bad
 reputation. It comes from a history of seeing accessibility as a
 bureaucratically burdensome compliance checklist,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Smyth went on to point out that accessibility can also offer significant
 business benefits, which not all suppliers realise. “As our accessibility
 agenda has matured, as our thinking has matured, we have come to realise
 that, yes, [accessibility] is a legal obligation, but there is a huge
 commercial opportunity of finding innovation from the edges … It’s
 about providing a positive experience for a greater number of people and
 avoiding unwitting exclusion, and making sure that in the shiny new digital
 channels and content and apps and cash machines we’re building, no one
 gets left out or left behind.”
</p>
<p> 
 Smyth also talked about the importance of thorough user-testing to ensure
 that digital products and services are usable by as many customers as
 possible, whether those customers have a disability or otherwise: “We
 have to involve and consult with a wide range of users, and actually we
 need to shift our perspective. It’s not just about disabled people, but
 about designing for difference.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Sounding Out The Web.</h3>
<p> 
 By David Swallow.
</p>
<p> 
 - Editor’s note:
 This is a condensed version of a two-part article originally published on
 the blog of The Paciello Group, an international accessibility agency.
 Links to the original posts can be found at the end of this article. David
 Swallow is an Accessibility Associate at The Paciello Group.
 - Editor’s Note ends.
</p>
<p> 
 The largely visual nature of the web means that there’s a lot of focus on
 supporting people who are blind or partially sighted. But deaf and hard of
 hearing people are often overlooked. Ruth MacMullen, a copyright and
 licences officer at York St. John University, explains her experience of
 being deaf and how it affects her use of the web.
</p>
<p> 
 “It’s a matter of quite ferocious debate at times,” says Ruth on the
 topic of preferred naming for deafness and hearing loss. “For me, it
 depends on what sort of mood I’m in. If I’m feeling a bit shy about it,
 I think ‘hearing impaired’ sounds softer than ‘deaf’. Sometimes I
 say ‘hard of hearing’. That’s usually enough to tell people that
 you’ve got a problem hearing, that you need a bit of extra
 consideration.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ruth was born profoundly deaf, meaning she has little to no residual
 hearing. Powerful hearing aids later gave Ruth some hearing, and with the
 support of a speech and language therapist, she learned to speak. A
 combination of cochlear implants and hearing aids gave Ruth what she
 describes as “pretty reasonable hearing”.
</p>
<p> 
 Although Ruth now has access to a variety of sounds, her hearing loss still
 affects her day-to-day life. She cites the example of working in a busy
 open-plan office, where spontaneous and informal conversations spring up.
 Ruth says: “A lot of information is shared by accident. I’m aware I
 miss all that. If there’s something important, people should try and draw
 you in, but it’s impossible to do that all the time. Accessibility is
 often built around structures and planning, isn’t it? So I think
 ‘unplanned accessibility’ is a really hard thing.”
</p>
<p> 
 A similar lack of structure and planning among many developers hinders
 Ruth’s ability to use the web. The growing number of videos shared
 online, particularly through Facebook Live, are rarely subtitled. Ruth
 says: “If subtitles aren’t possible, then at least provide a
 description of what the video is about. That’s increasingly missing as
 people get more casual about posting content.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ruth recalls a video of Aretha Franklin that a friend shared on Facebook:
 “I see her playing the piano and think, ‘What song is she playing?
 There’s no description. It’s not that I need to hear every word, but
 sometimes I have no idea what’s happening.”
</p>
<p> 
 Here, Ruth explains more about what makes life easier for her online.
</p>
<p> 
 - Provide subtitles/captions.
</p>
<p> 
 “Subtitles, that’s the really obvious one,” says Ruth. The term
 ‘subtitles’ typically refers only to spoken content, whereas
 ‘captions’ also includes descriptions of non-speech sounds, such as
 music, applause and laughter. Outside of North America, the terms are often
 used interchangeably.
</p>
<p> 
 - Check the accuracy of captions.
</p>
<p> 
 In the United States, YouTube and Facebook offer free automated video
 captioning, but since there aren’t any humans involved, the captions they
 produce can be wildly inaccurate. “I’ve seen captions where irrelevant
 and inappropriate words came up, including expletives,” says Ruth. “I
 was surprised there was no protection or filtering to stop that.”
</p>
<p> 
 Google provides clear instructions on how you can review and edit automated
 captions on YouTube
 (link below to Google’s captioning advice:
 <a href="http://eab.li/5x">http://eab.li/5x</a>
 ), but you also need to take the time to edit them, because automated captions
 are notoriously terrible to begin with. Ruth explains: “It makes such a
 difference to a deaf person if a little bit of effort has been made to
 clean up subtitles. You can see that they are so much more accurate.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Make sure that captions are synchronised with the audio.
</p>
<p> 
 One advantage of using automated captioning is that the captions are
 automatically synchronised to the audio. Some video makers choose to
 generate their captions from an existing transcript. And if you do that,
 you need to make sure that each line appears on screen at about the same
 time as the audio is heard. “When you’re deaf, you want the captions to
 run in time,” explains Ruth.
</p>
<p> 
 - Provide a summary of audio and video content.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier, Ruth explained how a brief summary of what a video is about can be
 just as important as captions or a transcript. A video’s summary may be
 as simple as a list of topics or songs that the video includes, which Ruth
 likens to “alternative text for someone with a hearing impairment”.
</p>
<p> 
 Ruth recalls watching a concert on YouTube: “There’s a piano player
 playing Gershwin songs and I’ll think, ‘Which one do I want to listen
 to?’ I can’t skip through and listen to fragments, I need to know
 what’s in there before I make a choice to watch it. And I feel like I
 don’t have that choice if I don’t know what’s in it.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Make sure that audio doesn’t play automatically.
</p>
<p> 
 Deaf and hard of hearing people may have a difficult time gauging how loud
 videos are, particularly when they play automatically and unexpectedly. If
 it’s unavoidable for audio to play automatically, make sure that users
 have an easy way to turn it off. “You see a video on your Facebook feed
 and there’s no sound”, explains Ruth. “If you click on it to make it
 big, the sound plays, but you don’t realise. Sometimes I have my hearing
 aid off and I feel like the video is blaring out sound.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Structure your content.
</p>
<p> 
 “I rely so much on visual information,” says Ruth. “The more clearly
 it is structured and explained, the better.” Using semantic HTML helps
 websites remain flexible and extensible. It makes the content reusable and
 conveys more meaning to assistive technologies. As Ruth points out, “This
 is good practice generally, but for people who are completely reliant on
 visual information it’s even more important.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Keep your content flexible.
</p>
<p> 
 Underlying each of these suggestions is an emphasis on clear communication
 and flexibility of content. Mobile technology has proven particularly
 useful to Ruth in this respect. “I think if you speak to any person with
 a disability, they will tell you that an iPhone or an Apple Watch is a game
 changer,” says Ruth.
</p>
<p> 
 The benefit for Ruth is being able to curate information in a way that
 suits her. “I can’t hear a radio very well if it’s in a room, but if
 I plug in my Bluetooth headphones to my iPhone, I can listen to a radio
 programme. It’s a bit of a lifesaver in terms of being able to get
 information and content, and modify it in a way that works for me.”
</p>
<p> 
 Content that’s flexible enough to be delivered by captions, indexed by
 transcripts, enlarged by screen magnifiers, and rendered by screen-readers
 is a key principle of web accessibility. And while many of the tips in this
 post are useful for deaf and hard of hearing people, they ultimately
 benefit everyone.
