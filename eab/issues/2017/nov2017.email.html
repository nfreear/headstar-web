<h2 id="main"><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>

<h3 class="p4"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New online platform aims to be a
  game-changer for accessible ICT.</h3>

<p>An accessibility resources platform that claims to be ‘the first of
its kind in the world” has been launched.</p>

<p>DeveloperSpace aims to be a comprehensive portal for information on
inclusive digital content and systems, for a wide-ranging audience.
Although primarily aimed at developers, designers and anyone building
digital systems or content, the site has been created to foster
collaboration between different industries and disciplines, in the hope
of creating and sharing what the site calls ‘accessible solutions’ to ICT
accessibility problems.</p>

<p>To identify and address these problems effectively, computer-users
with a range of impairments were involved at all stages of building
DeveloperSpace.</p>

<p>Key features of the site include an ‘Accessibility Masterlist’ (which
gives information on a range of ICT accessibility features, such as
alternative computer settings and audio enhancement), ‘Quicksheets’
(summaries of topics such as social media accessibility and PDF readers)
and tutorials on a range of topics, such as inclusive e-publishing and
accessible web games.</p>

<p>Other features include a question and answer forum and a ‘Challenges’
section, where people can volunteer to solve accessibility tasks,
sometimes for prize money or funding. One challenge is based around
improving a ‘photosensitive seizure tool’ (which detects flashing web
content that could cause seizures in some users) so that it can be
released as open source, carrying a reward of $10,000.</p>

<p>DeveloperSpace was created as the main outcome of the European
Commission-funded Prosperity4All project and is part of the Global Public
Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII), both of which aim to drive forward
inclusive technology development and access to these technologies.</p>

<p>Gregg Vanderheiden – Prosperity4All’s Technical Coordinator and
Director and Professor of the Trace R&amp;D Center at the University of
Maryland – told e-Access Bulletin that as well as providing key
resources, another aim of DeveloperSpace is to collate knowledge and
ideas from across the board. He said: “A goal is to bring together input
from consumers and all members of a development team – specialists,
testers, teachers, researchers and more – to provide individual guides
about particular aspects of the site that may be helpful to them.”</p>

<p>Speaking about what makes the platform the ‘first of its kind in the
world,’ Vanderheiden said: “The DeveloperSpace differs from other sites
in that it looks at the problem comprehensively, providing tools for all
types of information and communication technologies – including anything
with a digital interface.”</p>

<p>DeveloperSpace has already been used to help build and improve a
number of accessibility projects, some of which are highlighted on the
site. These include printing services for visually impaired students and
a programme to create accessible video for refugees in the
Netherlands.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Funkify plugin reveals impaired browsing to all
users.</h3>

<p>A new browser plugin that distorts web pages to simulate the online
experience for users with impairments is aiming to encourage developers
to create more accessible websites and apps.</p>

<p>The Funkify tool features a range of filters, which intentionally make
it difficult to read and navigate online content. The intention is to
recreate how users with visual, print and motor impairments experience
the internet.</p>

<p>Funkify was developed by a team of accessibility enthusiasts from
companies and startup projects in Sweden. A prototype was created for a
‘hackathon’ competition in 2016 and was awarded a joint first place in
the event.</p>

<p>The group then successfully applied for innovation funding to build
the plugin during 2017. A new beta version has just been released for
testing.</p>

<p>The team worked with people with a range of impairments, to develop
the Funkify simulations, which imitate effects of sight loss (including
blurry vision, tunnel vision and central vision loss), ‘trembling hands’,
dyslexia and colour vision deficiency.</p>

<p>For example, the ‘tunnel vision’ filter blanks out a large part of the
user’s screen, leaving only a small area to read text on the page, while
the ‘trembling hand’ filter causes the cursor to judder constantly.</p>

<p>To make the simulations as authentic as possible, the team
“interviewed, brainstormed and tested” with people with different
impairments.</p>

<p>Speaking to e-Access Bulletin, one of Funkify’s co-founders, Lena
Furberg, said: “We strive to make the experience as memorable as
possible, so that people remember it and have accessibility in mind the
next time they create a colour palette, choose font sizes or decide on
the height of click targets.”</p>

<p>She added: “Of course, everyone experiences things differently, and
we’re not saying that people will understand exactly what life is like
with – for example – a tremor if you try the ‘trembling hand’
simulator.”</p>

<p>Reactions from users without impairments using Funkify have been
positive, but the goal remains to drive forward inclusive web design and
content by sharing the tool with developers. “It’s nice to see some
people get the point of ‘design for all’ and accessibility for the very
first time when they use Funkify,” Furberg said. “We hope to reach as
many web and app developers as possible and make them understand the
importance of making their products accessible, and prioritise this
higher than they do today.”</p>

<p>As a follow-up to the project, the team behind Funkify are also
building a separate tool that will simulate cognitive impairments,
including ADHD and autism, which will launch in December.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: New site guides businesses towards accessible
tourism.</h3>

<p>Tourism businesses in England and Scotland, such as hotels,
restaurants and sightseeing attractions are being encouraged to produce
‘accessibility guides’ online to let visitors know about access
facilities.</p>

<p>VisitEngland and VisitScotland, the official tourist boards for both
countries, have launched a website that gives organisations a template
for creating a guide. The result is a single, standardised page
containing comprehensive access information for users.</p>

<p>This information is available in simple menus, telling users which
areas in a venue have level access for wheelchair use, where there are
hearing loops for visitors with hearing aids, and what facilities exist
for visually impaired visitors, such as alternative print format
menus.</p>

<p>Also on the page are contact details for each venue, travel and
arrival information (such as accessible parking facilities and
wheelchair-friendly ramps), and the option to download the page as a Word
document.</p>

<p>Any business can use the site to produce a guide. Users just need to
register through the site and are then guided through the process
step-by-step. This includes looking at example guides, answering a
questionnaire on access facilities at the venue and uploading photos.</p>

<p>Once the guide has been created, the business is given a unique URL to
publish and share, allowing everyone to view the page. As the page is
created through a standardised template, visitors can easily familiarise
themselves with the format.</p>

<p>VisitEngland’s head of business support, Ross Calladine, told e-Access
Bulletin that the guides enable potential visitors to make informed
decisions about where to visit and stay, based on their individual needs.
Calladine said: “One in five of the UK population has accessibility
requirements, meaning that about 20% of potential customers would like to
have practical information on accessibility. Furthermore, with an ageing
population, those with accessibility requirements are likely to represent
an even larger section of the potential customer base. An accessibility
guide helps businesses to future-proof their venue.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><b class="Ps">++</b>News in Brief:</h2>

<p><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Inclusive Accommodation: Airbnb has taken a series of steps to
make its services more accessible for users with disabilities. The online
accommodation rental platform will incorporate listings from accessible
accommodation platform Accomable (which has been acquired by Airbnb) and
use new ‘accessibility needs’ checklists, (which allow hosts to provide
more detailed access info about their property for travellers with
disabilities), as well as working to make its website and mobile app
easier to use for all.</p>

<p><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Mobile Knowledge: A free guide on mobile accessibility features
for iOS and Android devices has been released by accessibility
consultancy The Paciello Group. The ‘mobile testing’ guide explains how
to use built-in accessibility apps and settings (such as Android’s
TalkBack and VoiceOver on iOS, including control gestures and shortcuts),
as well as how to test mobile web content for accessibility. The document
is aimed at anyone working with mobile apps and those who simply want to
know more about accessibility features on their smartphone.</p>

<p>The Mobile Accessibility Guide is available in accessible PDF at <a
href="https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2017/11/mobile-accessibility-testing-guide-for-android-and-ios-free/">The
Paciello Group’s website</a>.</p>

<p><b class="Ps">+</b>06: Digital Developments: The UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS)
Accessibility team have made a number of accessibility improvements
across its operations. One of the steps has been to publish and update a
series of guides, including an introduction to making services
accessible, information on testing websites for accessibility and
understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. The
changes have been informed by various pieces of research (including the
2016 GOV.UK assistive technology survey) which looked at how government
teams approached accessibility and the challenges they faced.</p>

<p><b class="Ps">+</b>07: App Happy: In last month’s Inbox, Tony Moss got in touch from
Manchester to ask for advice on the accessibility pros and cons of
iPhones and Android phones, and the apps for each device. Tony, who is
registered blind but has some vision in his left eye, wanted to know
which phone would be more useful for him before making a purchase.</p>

<p>Several readers contacted the Bulletin to flag up resources for Tony,
including Sophie Grattidge from sight loss charity Henshaws:</p>

<p>“Henshaws has recently created a free e-book with the 24 best
apps for people with a visual impairment, which I hope Tony or others may
find useful. We’ve divided the apps by topic and it covers
identification, social networking, navigation, shopping, work, reading
and entertainment.</p>

<p>“We also provide free one-to-one training and assessments for visually
impaired people in Manchester and Liverpool to guide them on what
technology to use and how to use it. If Tony needs any support, he can
get in touch by phoning 0161 872 1234 or emailing <a

<p><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Device Doctor: Another reader, Hannah Bailey, offers Tony more
advice on the iPhone vs Android issue, highlighting some other useful
resources:</p>

<p>“Re: Apple vs Android, I think budget needs to be considered.
Frustratingly, while accessibility settings have certainly improved,
there is little consistency across brands as to how they are laid out and
the terminology used in descriptions.</p>

<p>“I also suggest making sure any type of voiceover technology has a
quick shortcut option for toggling on and off, as it can be difficult to
navigate to it quickly in settings.</p>

<p>“The organisation I work for, Berneslai Homes [a social housing
landlord managing properties on behalf of Barnsley Council], has made
overview videos on Apple’s VoiceOver feature and apps for different
sensory impairments. The videos are available on the <a
href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCvuoSEIj2wIxjGZsSTQti5w">Berneslai
Homes ‘Device Doctor’ YouTube channel</a>. We can take requests
for app overview videos as well.</p>

<p>“RNIB’s excellent <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/online-today">Online

<h2 class="p4"><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Report.</h2> <p>– AI at TechShare Pro
2017.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Artificial intelligence and accessibility: the voice
of things to come.</h3>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) was high on the agenda at the recent
TechShare Pro 2017 conference in London. Hosted by AbilityNet and RNIB,
the event explored a wide range of topics and ideas around digital
accessibility and accessible technology, with a range of speakers
discussing key ideas and developments.</p>

<p>One of the most popular themes of the event was AI and its potential
benefits for accessibility. AI technologies have evolved at a tremendous
pace over recent years and are now being used in everything from stock
market trading to email management – but how can these technologies be
utilised to help people with disabilities and impairments?</p>

<p>As delegates at the event heard, numerous innovative systems and
projects using AI are being developed, which could have a huge impact in
the near future, but as some speakers pointed out, AI is also being used
to benefit people right now, in devices and apps that many people use
every day. Here’s a summary of how AI was covered throughout the
event.</p>

<p>Paul Smyth, Head of ICT Accessibility at Barclays, talked about the
future of banking from an accessibility point of view and how AI is
helping to enable this. Processes are becoming simpler, Smyth said, which
helps users to complete tasks with fewer issues. As an example and to
show how mobile banking is evolving, he then demonstrated a
voice-operated payment system through an app.</p>

<p>“Rather than users having to learn increasingly complicated systems,
there’s been a paradigm shift, where those systems now learn about users,
which is very powerful,” Smyth said.</p>

<p>Smyth also talked about the increasing use of biometrics systems in
banking, such as fingerprint recognition on apps, alongside voice and
facial recognition to identify customers.</p>

<p>He said: “These things are simple and secure, we just need to get more
comfortable in using them and the technology needs to evolve too.”</p>

<p>Smyth also talked about how technology is increasing personalisation
within banking and how this can improve user experience: “The exciting
bit in terms of AI is how it can power predictive insights,” he said,
explaining that AI will increasingly be used to advise customers on how
they can manage their money more effectively.</p>

<p>Following on from Smyth’s presentation was a panel discussion on ‘What
does AI mean for the future of accessibility?’, hosted by Robin
Christopherson, Head of Digital Inclusion at AbilityNet. Ellie Southwood,
Chair of RNIB, spoke about how various devices and apps are helping make
life easier for people with visual impairments. She explained how her
Amazon Echo Dot ‘smart speaker’ (which responds to voice commands and
questions from users) makes it simpler to find information, before
talking about a new talking camera app, Seeing AI.</p>

<p>She said: “The app’s ability to recognise not just text, but also
people and scenarios, is incredibly exciting, because in order to make
decisions about the world, you have to interpret it – and if you can’t
see, the interpretation you have is usually somebody else’s.”</p>

<p>Hector Minto, Technical Evangelist for Accessibility at Microsoft,
then explained how he thinks AI will change accessibility. He said: “One
of the challenges we have is to make accessibility matter to a wider
audience and this is one of the roles that AI can fulfil. Rather than
expecting somebody to provide information in an accessible format,
hopefully AI will mean that all documentation becomes accessible in the
future.”</p>

<p>Minto also spoke about Seeing AI and how he believes the app, and
other similar technologies, can change interactions for people with
disabilities. He said: “Seeing AI can recognise text, it can recognise
people and emotion, and recognising something changes the social dynamic
around disability.”</p>

<p>Explaining how someone who is blind could use the app to quickly
identify who is around them, Minto said: “It empowers people to enter a
room with their disability and take control, and that is a leveller.”</p>

<p>Following the discussion, an audience member asked the panel about
potential difficulties in using AI-based voice technologies, particularly
for people with cognitive impairments, and how these systems could be
made more accessible.</p>

<p>Responding to the question, Ellie Southwood said that there are still
“gaps” in the technology, but that using voice-operated AI systems to
carry out complicated tasks “has to be the future.” She explained that
these systems need to be customer-led and built around specific needs of
users to ensure they work effectively.</p>

<p>Hector Minto agreed with this point, claiming that: “People with
disabilities are going to lead the knowledge base on voice
interaction.”</p>

<p>Later on in the day, Gareth Ford Williams, Head of Accessibility for
Design and Engineering at the BBC, hosted a session on ‘The BBC
Accessibility Journey and the Impact of Artificial Intelligence.’
Williams discussed how new and emerging technologies are being used by
the BBC to make its operations more accessible for users.</p>

<p>He explained how AI can be used in ‘object-based broadcasting’ to
learn about users’ viewing habits and tailor how programmes are delivered
to them based on their requirements.</p>

<p>Speaking more generally about the potential of AI systems, Williams
said: “Disenfranchised audiences are really going to benefit. For older
audiences and others who struggle to use some assistive technologies,
having something more humanistic as a mode of interaction is going to
create a lot of opportunities for them.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Kiran Kaja, Technical Program Manager for Search
Accessibility at Google, gave some insights on current and future use of
AI. He pointed out that “AI is everywhere. It’s already being used quite
widely – for example, in speech recognition, which is based on ‘neural
networks’. This uses ‘machine learning’ to replicate how the human
nervous system works.”</p>

<p>He explained that improvements to text-to-speech and predictive text
systems are being made using AI, before discussing ‘computer vision’, in
reference to the kind of image recognition that apps like Seeing AI use.
Kaja said: “Being able to use computer vision to recognise objects and
find the relationship between the objects – those things have really big
potential for helping people with disabilities.”</p>

<p>Kaja also addressed a key issue that delegates had been discussing
throughout the day: ease-of-use of AI systems, particularly for users
with impairments. He said: “The great thing about all of this is that as
a user, you shouldn’t need to worry about what AI is and what it can do –
it should all just work for you. That’s the hallmark of great UX [user
experience] design.”</p>
