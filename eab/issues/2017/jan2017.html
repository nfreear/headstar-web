<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Closure Threat For Digital Inclusion Charity Seeking £20,000 Tosurvive.
</h3>
<p> 
 A UK charity offering digital skills training to hundreds of people with
 disabilities will be forced to shut unless &pound;20,000 of running costs are
 provided urgently.
</p>
<p> 
 Cambridge Online provides 4,000 one-to-one tutorials by ‘digital
 champions’ for over 300 disabled, disadvantaged and older people each
 year from around Cambridgeshire and beyond. The charity teaches learners a
 wide range of digital literacy skills, including beginners’ online
 courses, online shopping, services and job-hunting, Facebook and social
 media use, and individual training requested by learners.
</p>
<p> 
 Established in the mid-’90s, the charity currently relies on a mix of
 grants, donations and fees from a range of organisations, including
 Cambridge City Council and Good Things Foundation. These funds allow most
 services to be offered for free, with others at a low cost. Most of the
 skills training sessions and personal tutorials are given by a volunteer
 team of 30 digital champions.
</p>
<p> 
 However, in the last few years the charity has “struggled to make ends
 meet,” Andrew Entecott, Cambridge Online’s Chief Executive, told
 e-Access Bulletin. Entecott explained that raising the charity’s &pound;70,000
 annual running costs has not been possible due to a lack of business
 sponsorship, with only one business supporting the charity.
</p>
<p> 
 Separate grant and fee income for the charity is scheduled for April, but
 the situation has become urgent. Entecott said: “Cambridge Online only
 has a few weeks of running costs remaining. Although grants and fees are
 due to arrive in April, the charity does not currently have enough money to
 pay costs in February and March.”
</p>
<p> 
 Anyone interested in helping Cambridge Online continue to provide its
 services can contact the charity’s Chief Executive, Andrew Entecott, at
 the following email address:
 <a href="mailto:andrew@cambridgeonline.org.uk">andrew@cambridgeonline.org.uk</a> .</p>

<h3 id="i186-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: City Mobility Apps Trialled To Fight Blue Badge Fraud Across Europe.</h3>
<p> 
 A three-year pan-European project to improve urban transportation for
 mobility impaired citizens – featuring a smartphone-based parking card to
 stop fraud – is drawing to a close and preparing recommendations for the
 European Commission.
</p>
<p> 
 The aim of the SIMON project is to increase independent living for people
 in cities with mobility impairments. Two mobile apps were developed as part
 of the process: an ‘ICT-enhanced parking card’ for drivers, and a
 journey-planning app.
</p>
<p> 
 The parking card is effectively an updated version of the current
 European-approved Blue Badge held by drivers with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Illegal copying of Blue Badges has become a problem in recent years, and
 the SIMON parking card aims to eliminate this by using contactless
 technology. The new card features a chip and QR code that connect to a
 mobile app, meaning that parking enforcement staff can scan the card from
 outside the vehicle and check the identity of the card owner, preventing
 misuse and fraud.
</p>
<p> 
 The mobile app allows citizens to plan accessible journeys across a city,
 based on their needs. Routes can be adapted to suit wheelchair-users,
 people with visual impairments, and different walking speeds. For example,
 the app can tell users about wheelchair ramps at metro and subway stations,
 or where to find disabled parking spaces.
</p>
<p> 
 An ‘international consortium’ of nine partners across five countries
 (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany and the UK) are taking part in the
 project, with large-scale pilots in Madrid, Parma, Lisbon and Reading. At
 the moment, the SIMON mobile app (available to download for free on iOS and
 Android) is only usable in these four pilot cities
</p>
<p> 
 Planned as a three-year scheme, SIMON finishes at the end of March, and
 project leaders are drawing up conclusions from the work. The mobile app
 will continue to be available to download and use after SIMON ends. The
 project team are encouraging people in the pilot cities to continue using
 the app and leaving feedback on how it can be improved.
</p>
<p> 
 SIMON Project Manager Eva Muñoz Navarro told e-Access Bulletin about some
 of the key findings and conclusions: “We have found out how useful it is
 to have the end-users [older and disabled citizens] as part of the design
 process. We have also realised that even if the ICT parking card is welcome
 and everybody is happy to have a fraud-fighting tool, not everybody is used
 to mobile apps and technology – particularly the elderly.”
</p>
<p> 
 The last phases of the project include drawing up guidelines on how SIMON
 can be used elsewhere. Navarro said that the team is already working with
 other cities in Europe interested in using the SIMON platform to make their
 mobility systems more inclusive.
</p>
<p> 
 The project team are also preparing a recommendation for the European
 Commission to explain how the current parking card for mobility impaired
 drivers could be adapted, using the increased security measures trialled
 during SIMON. Navarro said: “The European Commission might decide to
 update the current recommendation, from 1998, and to consider the
 possibility of modernising the parking card based on SIMON proposals.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: One Third Of Councils Fail Web Accessibility Testing In Uk-Widesurvey.
</h3>
<p> 
 An annual review of council websites across the UK has revealed that one
 third of local government sites failed first-stage testing to find out how
 accessible their websites are for users with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Carried out by Socitm (the Society of IT Management), the Better Connected
 survey is a nationwide examination to evaluate local authority websites on
 a range of factors.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility of those websites for users with impairments is always
 examined. This includes assessing how users with low vision, sight loss,
 mobility impairments, colour blindness, dyslexia and others using assistive
 technology or keyboard navigation can access council websites.
</p>
<p> 
 However, this year Better Connected introduced a new two-stage process for
 the accessibility assessment. The first stage examined all 416 council
 website homepages, based on 14 criteria.
</p>
<p> 
 These included: appropriate text alternatives for images (this is essential
 for screen-reader users); ability to resize text to 200% without loss of
 content (this helps a range of users with partial sight loss); and
 “present and functioning skip links,” (these allow screen-reader users
 to arrive directly at a web page’s main content).
</p>
<p> 
 Councils that failed to meet seven or more of these points on their
 homepages were not allowed to enter the next stage of Better Connected.
 Additionally, if any homepages were found to have ‘keyboard traps’
 (elements that make it impossible for keyboard-only users to move around
 the screen) or lack of ‘visible focus indicators’ (these allow users to
 recognise where on a page they are navigating to and from – again crucial
 for keyboard-only users and people with certain visual impairments), the
 sites failed stage one immediately.
</p>
<p> 
 However, sites that did fail were given the opportunity to resolve their
 accessibility problems before the end of January.
</p>
<p> 
 These initial accessibility tests were carried out in December 2016 by
 non-profit social enterprise Digital Accessibility Centre, by users with a
 range of disabilities and impairments. These assessments found that around
 one third of the 416 councils tested failed to meet seven or more of the
 essential accessibility requirements. This means they are ineligible for
 the full assessment, unless the issues are fixed and the councils apply for
 re-testing.
</p>
<p> 
 The next stage of Better Connected testing will take place in February.
 This second stage will feature a broader accessibility examination for all
 councils that passed the initial test.

<p>

Section Three: Interview – Accessible gaming.
</p>
<p>  making a whole universe accessible.</p>
<p> 
 As the accessible gaming community grows at a rapid pace, so too does the
 number of games being developed with accessibility for all users in mind.
 ‘Tau Station’ is a fascinating example of good practice in this area.
</p>
<p> 
 A free, text-based MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)
 with a science fiction theme, ‘Tau Station’ gives players an entire
 universe to explore – a universe which its developers have taken great
 care to make accessible for players with impairments, through a huge range
 of features.
</p>
<p> 
 Still currently in development, anyone wanting to play ‘Tau Station’
 can register their interest in testing the game before the launch by
 signing up on the official ‘Tau Station’ blog – details and links at
 the end of the article.
</p>
<p> 
 e-Access Bulletin chatted to Lainie, one of the game’s developers, to
 find out more about the quest to make ‘Tau Station’ accessible for all.
</p>
<p> 
 ¬- Please tell us about ‘Tau Station’:
</p>
<p> 
 “We don’t really think of ‘Tau Station’ as a game. It’s universe
 to explore and a place where people can make a life for themselves online.
 The setting is several hundred years in the future, not long after a
 mysterious event called the Catastrophe has occurred. Survivors are
 struggling to put civilisation back together again.
</p>
<p> 
 “What players do and who they are is up to them. They can explore the
 galaxy, start a career, fight other players, help rebuild civilisation or
 profit from its downfall, make friends, set up a social network, and much
 more. Some people take missions or interact with characters to get clues
 about what caused the Catastrophe. It’s a complete world, ready for
 people to experience.
</p>
<p> 
 “‘Tau Station’ is a text-based universe, but it’s more than just
 words on a screen. To create an immersive environment, we’ve supplemented
 the narrative with a user-interface and custom artwork that give it a
 strong science fiction look and feel. There are no moving graphics,
 downloads, or special controllers needed, so you can play it on any device
 with a browser.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How and when was the concept for ‘Tau Station’ developed?
</p>
<p> 
 “Curtis Poe came up with the idea in 2010. He’d been playing text games
 online and liked that their emphasis was on thinking and planning rather
 than reacting to action with lightning-fast reflexes. Having grown up
 reading authors like Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury, he
 enjoyed the grand vision of space opera and started thinking about how he
 could bring it to the text-based game environment.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Did you design accessibility features into the game as it was being built
 or add those elements in afterwards?
</p>
<p> 
 “We decided to make ‘Tau Station’ accessible after working with Job
 van Achterberg. Job is a strong advocate for accessibility, and he’s the
 one who made us realise we weren’t taking part of the population into
 account with our development. This realisation made the decision simple.
</p>
<p> 
 “A few weeks later, Rinchen Emma Ridley and Job joined us on the project,
 and they took everything apart to make ‘Tau Station’ accessible. After
 that, it simply became part of the process. Now, accessibility is taken
 into consideration with everything. It’s not an afterthought, it’s just
 our normal design process thanks to Emma and Job.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What measures have you taken to make ‘Tau Station’ accessible for
 players with disabilities and impairments?
</p>
<p> 
 “Our goal with ‘Tau Station’ is to be as inclusive as possible. This
 means building the game from a progressively enhanced and responsive point
 of view, as well as incorporating WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Beyond that, we
 consider a variety of users when adding features.
</p>
<p> 
 “We ask ourselves all kinds of questions, like: ‘What is this feature
 for? Can the player disable or customise it? Would it work without
 JavaScript? What happens when the player uses browser zoom? Can players use
 this feature via keyboard, mouse, touch, and voice? Are there any known
 browser or assistive technology bugs we should be aware of?”
</p>
<p> 
 - Were there any big challenges in terms of accessibility?
</p>
<p> 
 “The more challenging elements of the game have been the navigation, and
 elements that require a lot of user-interaction and feedback. Designing the
 training sliders in the gym and our interactive star map are good examples.
</p>
<p> 
 “Probably the most challenging element is to ensure that processes are
 accessible from start to finish. We have to make sure that the context and
 flow is not lost at any point to any user, regardless of how they interact
 with the game.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Why was it so important to make ‘Tau Station’ as accessible as
 possible?
</p>
<p> 
 “That’s simple; when someone shows you that you’ve been ignoring a
 part of the population for a huge part of your life, you can’t go back.
 ‘Tau Station’ is accessible, as will be any other game that we develop.
 It’s not that difficult to make it happen. You just have to want it, and
 surround yourself with the right people.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Are games developers thinking more about accessibility nowadays?
</p>
<p> 
 “We’d like to think so, but it’s hard to see from within the
 ‘accessibility bubble’. But seeing conferences like #GAconf
 (Read about the conference at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/4o">http://eab.li/4o</a>
 ) and websites dedicated to the subject, such as Game Accessibility.com
 (found at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/4p">http://eab.li/4p</a>
 ) and Game Accessibility Guidelines.com
 (found at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/4q">http://eab.li/4q</a>
 ) leads us to believe that there’s increasing awareness.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How do you want ‘Tau Station’ to develop, and how will you keep it
 accessible as it evolves?
</p>
<p> 
 “‘Tau Station’ is going to evolve as stories in books evolve, with
 different chapters; chapters that we write for the players and the ones
 that they will write for themselves.
</p>
<p> 
 “Asking us how we’ll keep ‘Tau Station’ accessible is a little like
 asking us if it will continue to be a science fiction game as it evolves!
 ‘Tau Station’ is accessible and will stay accessible. It’s the choice
 that we’ve made and also part of the design process, so any new
 functionality that we implement will be accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 “With the right team, with the right people, there is no reason for that
 to change. Accessibility is a state of mind, and the fact that the
 technology evolves doesn’t change anything. We will evolve with it.”
