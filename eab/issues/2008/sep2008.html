<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Target Agrees Six Million Dollar Accessibility Case Settlement.
</h3>
<p> 

 Following a two-year legal battle, US superstore chain Target has

 agreed to pay six million dollars to settle a class action brought against

 it for the inaccessibility of its website.

</p>
<p> 

 The company also agreed to make changes to its site to ensure it is

 accessible, to pay for regular independent accessibility testing of its

 site, and to pay the legal fees of those who brought the case, although it

 does not accept liability or agree that the website is inaccessible (

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/target1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/target1</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 The case was brought in 2006 by Bruce Sexton, a blind student from

 the University of California Berkeley, then aged 24, with the support of

 the National Federation of the Blind (NFB - <a href="http://www.nfb.org/">http://www.nfb.org/</a>
). Two
 other individuals subsequently joined the case, Melissa Williamson and

 James Marks.

</p>
<p> 

 The plaintiffs had alleged that Target's website

 ( <a href="http://www.target.com/">http://www.target.com/</a>
 )
  was inaccessible to visually impaired screenreader users in what

 amounted to "systemic civil rights violations" by the company

 ( <a href="http://www.nfbtargetlawsuit.com/">http://www.nfbtargetlawsuit.com/</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 They told a district court in San Francisco that the site "contains

 thousands of access barriers that make it difficult if not impossible for

 blind customers to use the website...Target thus excludes the blind

 from full and equal participation in the growing Internet economy that

 is increasingly a fundamental part of the common market place and

 daily life."

</p>
<p> 

 Although Target did not admit to liability, or accept that it had broken

 the law or that its website was inaccessible, many analysts feel the size

 of the payment may be enough to cause other website owners to

 improve accessibility now rather than risk being forced to make similar

 payments.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Navigation Aid Among Insight Radio'S 'Vision 2008' Reports.
</h3>
<p> 

 A new device called STEP-HEAR (

 <a href="http://stephear.com/">http://stephear.com/</a>
 ),
 enabling blind and partially sighted people to navigate in public places,

 is among technologies reviewed by the RNIB's radio station Insight

 Radio as part of its reporting from Vision 2008

 (<a href="http://www.vision2008.ca/">http://www.vision2008.ca/</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 Vision 2008, held this summer in Montreal, Canada, is the world's

 biggest conference on low vision.

</p>
<p> 

 STEP-HEAR is a relatively low cost device consisting of two parts. A

 base station includes a speaker and a small recording device onto

 which the user can record, re-record or store sounds and messages. The

 second part, a remote control, can be worn as a pendant, strapped to the

 wrist or carried in a pocket. When a blind person carrying the remote

 control walks within range of the base the remote vibrates, prompting

 the user to press a button to hear the message or sound recorded.

</p>
<p> 

 In an interview with Insight Radio Nurit Neustadt-Noy, of the device's

 Israeli manufacturer Consultation and Rehabilitation Services, said it

 could help people distinguish between men's and women's toilets, or

 determine what number bus has arrived at a stop. Another feature

 could alert the bus driver that a blind person is trying to enter the

 vehicle so assistance could be offered.

</p>
<p> 

 Other possible uses if purchased by individuals could be to help blind

 people identify their own suitcase on an airport carousel, or to help

 people navigate back to their hotel room by hanging the base station on

 the back of the door.

</p>
<p> 

  "Or see here in this hall, how many blind people need assistance just

 to know who are the presenters?" said  Neustadt-Noy. "If we put a

 device in each of the booths, as you walked by it would vibrate and

 you could press the button and you would know which company is

 represented there."

</p>
<p> 

 The interview and a wide range of others from the conference can be

 heard at Insight Radio's website:

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/insight2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/insight2</a>
 .
</p>
<p> 

 Other coverage includes an interview with Vincent Lebec from

 Haptecs, discussing force feedback devices for mobile phones and

 refreshable tactile graphics devices allowing blind students to access

 mathematical diagrams in schoolbooks.

</p>
<p> 

 Insight Radio - the Glasgow-based station formerly known as VIP On

 Air - is now broadcast on the web, on Sky channel 0188 and 101 FM

 in Glasgow. A blind presenter and producer from the station, Michael

 Hughes, came second in last week's final of the TV show 'Big

 Brother'.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Call For Research Into Elderly Access To Mobile Phones.
</h3>
<p> 

 Mobile phones and other mobile technologies have great potential to

 help older people, but existing methods of evaluating older people's

 access requirements for such technologies are inadequate, according to

 a paper presented at last week's British HCI (human-computer

 interaction) 2008 conference at Liverpool John Moores University (

 <a href="http://www.hci2008.org/">http://www.hci2008.org/</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 The paper, by Sofianiza Malik and Alistair Edwards from the

 Department of Computer Science, University of York, was presented at

 a workshop on HCI and the older population.

</p>
<p> 

 "Many of the commonly-used techniques of requirements capture for

 mobile technologies are inappropriate for use with older people, for a

 variety of reasons," it says. "These may be related to problems

 associated with age, cognitive complexity and motivation. The result is

 to restrict the potential of mobile technologies to provide support to

 older people."

</p>
<p> 

 The York team is currently undertaking research to identify user

 requirement methods that are suitable and appropriate for older people

 using mobile technology.

</p>
<p> 

 Other papers presented at Liverpool covered issues including web

 access for older people; and inclusive design for older people. All the

 workshop papers can be accessed online at:

</p>
<h3 id="i105-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Spam Tips:</h3>
<p>  A further spam-fighting tip has emerged from the
 ongoing debate on our E-Access Bulletin Live blog about the use of

 inaccessible 'CAPTCHA' anti-spam

 tools by some websites.

</p>
<p> 

 David O'Brien writes: "We recently relaunched our site and used

 server-side validation on forms, rather than javascript. Content spam

 has dropped dramatically (almost disappeared, in fact) since. The

 validation scripting is quite time-consuming, but if you subtract the

 amount of time colleagues are not dealing with spam, it is probably

 worth the effort (though I haven't done the sums yet).

</p>
<p> 

 "We get about 100 enquiries a month through forms on our site. We

 completely rejected the option of CAPTCHA (although it had been

 requested by some colleagues) because of the accessibility issues; but

 also because it makes it harder for everyone to use, not just those with

 disabilities. I have 20/20 vision and I sometimes have difficulty

 deciphering CAPTCHAs.

</p>
<p> 

 "Another possibility we considered was simply to classify any form

 submission with a URL in it as spam. Over 95% of the spam we used

 to receive contained a URL. So just add a note in the label of your

 form inputs to say 'do not enter a URL', and write a script so that any

 submission containing the string '<a href="http://'">http://'</a>
 is rejected."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: The Six Million Dollar Question.
By Majeed Saleh And Dan Jellinek.

</h3>
<p> 

 For years the web accessibility community has been waiting for clear

 legal precedent to be set enforcing the accessibility of websites for

 people with disabilities, but to date the wait has gone largely

 unrewarded.

</p>
<p> 

 The ruling cited most often dates back to 2000, when blind web user

 Bruce Maguire won 20,000 Australian Dollars from the organisers of

 the Sydney Olympics for failing to address the inaccessibility of the

 games' website (for case details see <a href="http://contenu.nu/socog.html">http://contenu.nu/socog.html</a>
 and
 E-Access Bulletin back issues including August 2008). But the ruling

 was that of an equal opportunity commission rather than a full court,

 and has little resonance outside that country.

</p>
<p> 

 Since then, a series of cases brought in the UK and elsewhere have

 been settled out of court with payments made to plaintiffs, often in

 secret. Such settlements are frustrating: for while it is understandable

 that complainants, many of whom are people with disabilities, are

 inclined to accept offers of financial compensation in return for

 dropping their claims, only completed court cases can set a legal

 precedent.

</p>
<p> 

 On the other hand, if the settlement is large enough, and is made

 public, then even if it comes with a disclaimer of liability, other

 website owners may sit up and take notice: no-one wants to have to

 make large payouts.

</p>
<p> 

 Enter Bruce Sexton, a blind student from the University of California

 Berkeley. In 2006, when Sexton was aged just 24, he brought a class

 action over website inaccessibility against the American superstore

 chain Target, with the support of the National Federation of the Blind

 (NFB - <a href="http://www.nfb.org/">http://www.nfb.org/</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 Sexton, with the NFB and joined by two other individuals, Melissa

 Williamson and James Marks, filed a case centred on the

 inaccessibility of the Target website to visually impaired screenreader

 users ( <a href="http://www.nfbtargetlawsuit.com/">http://www.nfbtargetlawsuit.com/</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 Target runs more than 1,500 stores in the US, and its online store (

 <a href="http://www.target.com/">http://www.target.com/</a>
 )
 receives around 25 million unique visitors a month, according to

 figures from compete.com. The plaintiffs alleged "systemic civil rights

 violations" by Target. They told the United States District Court, San

 Francisco Division, that "Target.com provides to the public a wide

 array of the goods, services, price discounts, employment opportunities

 and other programs offered by Target. Yet, Target.com contains

 thousands of access barriers that make it difficult if not impossible for

 blind customers to use the website.

</p>
<p> 

 "In fact, the access barriers make it literally impossible for blind users

 to even complete a transaction on the website. Target thus excludes the

 blind from full and equal participation in the growing Internet

 economy that is increasingly a fundamental part of the common market

 place and daily life."

</p>
<p> 

 After two years of wrangling, Target has finally agreed, in a settlement

 announced on 27 August, to pay the plaintiffs 6 million dollars plus

 legal fees. The company also agreed to make changes to their site to

 ensure it is accessible (

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/target1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/target1</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 It is true that Target does not admit to liability, or accept that it was

 breaking the law or even that its website was inaccessible. On the other

 hand, the size of the payment is enough in itself to send shivers down

 the spine of anyone offering large-scale services online.

</p>
<p> 

 Struan Robertson, Legal director at solicitors Pinsent Masons, told E-

 Access Bulletin that the ruling would have the strongest influence in

 California, meaning any website selling to customers in that state

 would have to make accessibility a real consideration. That influence,

 however, does not extend to other parts of the US, so much uncertainty

 remains.

</p>
<p> 

 "If it encourages other sites to improve accessibility then it's a good

 thing, and it's encouraging that the comments of the judge were

 supportive of the need for accessibility," Robertson says.

</p>
<p> 

 Peter Abrahams, expert on accessibility and usability at technology

 research consultancy Bloor, says companies faced with the possibility

 of a similar lawsuit are likely to look at the settlement and decide that

 it may make more sense for them to make the necessary changes to

 their websites now. "I would be surprised if people go to court again,"

 he says.

</p>
<p> 

 Interestingly the standards of accessibility to which Target is bound to

 comply are not the most widely recognised ones such as the World

 Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

 (WCAG), but standards developed by Target themselves. These

 'Target Online Assistive Technology Guidelines'

 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/target2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/target2</a>
 )
 contain similar guidance as other accessibility standards such as the

 requirement to use alternative text for images, but make no reference to

 WCAG or any other generally accepted standards.

</p>
<p> 

 Abrahams told the E-Access Bulletin that this was not necessarily a

 problem. WCAG standards are highly technical, he said, and the Target

 standards are written in a way that people working at the company will

 understand and can implement. "It's a good document, a good example

 of what people should do," says Abrahams. "People should take

 advantage of the fact that it this document is now publicly available."

</p>
<p> 

 As part of the agreement, the NFB will perform quarterly automated

 tests on the Target website to ensure it is meeting its obligations. Every

 year an accessibility consultant will perform a detailed examination of

 the site and the NFB will conduct user tests with the JAWS

 screenreader, reporting the findings to Target. All this testing will be

 paid for by Target.

</p>
<p> 

 So from where might the next court action come?

 Interestingly, the technology behind Target's website is provided by

 Amazon Enterprise Solutions

 ( <a href="http://www.amazonservices.com/amazoncommerce/">http://www.amazonservices.com/amazoncommerce/</a>
 ),
 An offshoot of the online retailer Amazon which provides e-commerce

 solutions to various other companies including Sears Canada

 ( <a href="http://www.sears.ca">http://www.sears.ca</a>
 ),
 Marks and Spencer

 ( <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com">http://www.marksandspencer.com</a>
 )
 and Mothercare

 ( <a href="http://www.mothercare.com/">http://www.mothercare.com/</a>
 ).

 Could these other sites be vulnerable? Not necessarily. In March 2007,

 Amazon.com and the NFB signed an agreement which would see them

 "work together to develop and promote technologies that improve web

 accessibility for the blind." This agreement however covers the website

 Amazon.com, and not explicitly the technology that Amazon provides

 to other e-commerce sites

 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nfb1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nfb1</a>
 ).

 Only time will tell if other cases will be brought and settlements

 reached. But the incentive is there: six million dollars is an attractive

 carrot for potential plaintiffs, and a big stick for potential defendants.
