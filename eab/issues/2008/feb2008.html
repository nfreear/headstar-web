<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i98-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Work Begins On British Standard For Accessible Websites.</h3>
<p> 
 Work has begun on the development of a full British Standard for
 developing accessible websites, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The move follows the publication by the British Standards Institution
 (BSi) in March 2006 of initial guidance known as a 'PAS' or 'Publicly
 Available Specification'. This was 'PAS 78: a guide to good practice
 in commissioning accessible websites'.
</p>
<p> 
 A new technical committee IST/45 is now being assembled to oversee
 the development of a full standard, of which the chair elect is PAS78
 lead author Julie Howell, former RNIB digital access campaigner and
 currently head of accessibility at the digital agency Fortune Cookie.
 Other members of the committee are likely to be drawn from
 organisations represented on the PAS78 steering group such as the
 British Computer Society; Cabinet Office; and the former Disability
 Rights Commission (DRC), now part of the Equality and Human
 Rights Commission.
</p>
<p> 
 When finished, the British Standard will be available for purchase from
 the BSi at a price comparable with other standards, usually between
 £30 and £100. PAS78 was made available for free download by DRC,
 which sponsored its development and bought a distribution licence,
 though this type of arrangement is not possible for full standards. The
 PAS has been downloaded more than 54,000 times to date.
</p>
<p> 
 The new standard will relate to procurement or development of
 accessible websites. It will not set out the technical requirements of
 accessibility, but will outline a process developers can follow to ensure
 they are taking all the right actions to make their websites and services
 as inclusive as possible. In an exclusive interview with E-Access
 Bulletin published in this issue, Julie Howell says BSi would like the
 standard to be based on PAS78 but she is also keen to widen it to
 embrace some of the new types of web service such as social
 networking. Other issues to be revisited from the PAS include the need
 for user testing of websites by disabled people; and the need for
 organisations to produce an accessibility policy.
</p>
<p> 
 The standard is likely to be published in the first quarter of 2009,
 Howell says, and the committee IST/45 could eventually produce other
 work such as leaflets and training materials, some of which might be
 made available without charge.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: For the full interview with Julie Howell see Section Three, this
 issue.
</p>
<h3 id="i98-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Public Bodies 'Face Assistive Technology Legal Action'.</h3>
<p> 
 An increasing amount of research showing that large numbers of staff
 with dyslexia and other disabilities can benefit from assistive
 technology mean that public sector bodies face the likelihood of legal
 action this year or next under the Disability Discrimination Act, a
 leading analyst said this month.
</p>
<p> 
 David Evans, Education development manager at computer access firm
 Microlink PC (<a href="http://www.microlinkpc.co.uk/">http://www.microlinkpc.co.uk/</a>
), told the Dyslexia and the Civil Service conference in London that research carried out by his
 company in schools had found that some 28% of pupils could benefit
 from assistive software.
</p>
<p> 
 A large amount of similar research, coupled with ever-falling costs of
 assistive technologies such as screen filters, text to speech and voice
 recognition tools, mean it is only a matter of time before public sector
 employers are forced to implement assistive technology through legal
 action, Evans said.
</p>
<p> 
 Under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act public sector
 employers must make "reasonable" adjustments to facilities to allow
 access by all staff, he said. "So what information is available to
 employers at the moment? We know at least 10% of the workforce is
 dyslexic. We know there is a truckload of technology out there that can
 help, for probably less than 1% of the employment costs of the
 individual. So the information is there, it is public knowledge, the
 resources are there and they know people will benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 "So the judge will say - yes, that was reasonable, why wasn't it done?
 There are going to be some landmark cases, this year or next year."
</p>

<h3 id="i98-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Kurzweil Unveils Smallest Text Scanner And Converter.</h3>
<p> 
 The smallest ever portable device allowing users to scan printed text
 and convert it to speech has been unveiled by KNFB Reading
 Technology. The KNFB Reader uses software installed on a Nokia
 N82 multi-function mobile phone handset weighing only 114 grams
 (<a href="http://www.knfbreader.com/">http://www.knfbreader.com/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The device allows users to take pictures of printed materials using the
 phone's integrated camera while the KNFB software, which includes
 intelligent imaging and character recognition, allows the text to be
 resized, tracked and highlighted on-screen or converted into synthetic
 speech. In addition the screen reader software can help a visually
 impaired user to access more of the phone's features which include a
 calendar, internet access, music player, voice recorder, GPS navigation
 and PDF viewer.
</p>
<p> 
 KNFB is a partnership of the National Federation of the Blind in the
 US and Kurzweil Technologies, the company set up by celebrated
 inventor and futurologist Raymond Kurzweil, pioneer of Optical
 Character Recognition and text-to-speech technology in the 1970s.
</p>
<p> 
 The software is available in the UK for 1,080 pounds, with a package
 including software, a Nokia handset and half a day of training available
 for 1,725 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 In May Kurzweil will be further enhancing his reputation as a man of
 the future when he appears as an interactive hologram to be the
 keynote speaker at a charity dinner. The Children's Vision Awards
 Dinner is organised by the Association for Retinopathy of Prematurity
 and Related Diseases (<a href="http://www.ropard.org/">http://www.ropard.org/</a>
) and Kurzweil's hologram will use 'digital teleportation' technology developed by
 Teleportec (<a href="http://www.teleportec.com/">http://www.teleportec.com/</a>
).</p>

<h3 id="i98-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Flash Encouragement:</h3>
<p>  Julie Howell, Director of Accessibility at Fortune Cookie (and interviewee elsewhere in this issue of E-Access
 Bulletin for her work on a British Standard for developing accessible
 websites), writes in with feedback on last month's articles on the
 accessibility of Adobe Flash web multimedia technology. She says:
 "Your report on accessible Flash was extremely encouraging. Many of
 us remember the days when a Flash site was an inaccessible site.
</p>
<p> 
 "But how many Flash developers are aware that they can make the
 Flash they code more accessible? For its efforts to produce real
 success, Adobe must invest energy in educating web developers in how
 to create accessible Flash.
</p>
<p> 
 "I also hope that Adobe will do more outreach with blind and partially
 sighted web users, many of whom remember the dark days of Flash
 only too well and who will need a bit of encouragement (training and
 persuasion!) to give it another go. I've lost count of the number of
 times I've heard blind web users say 'That site's not accessible to me
 because it's in Flash,' without actually trying to access it.
</p>
<p> 
 "The stigma that still surrounds Flash must be challenged. I hope
 Adobe will extend its outreach activities beyond Techshare, so blind
 and partially sighted people will understand that a Flash site can be an
 accessible site.
</p>
<p> 
 "Adobe's accessibility heroes (Andrew Kirkpatrick and Greg Pisocky)
 are based in the USA. Perhaps Adobe should consider recruiting an
 outreach person for the UK and Europe. Even a short burst of effort
 would help to bring all those who live in 'Flash accessibility limbo' up
 to speed.
</p>
<p> 
 "The hard work of making Flash accessible has been done. The task
 before Adobe now is in encouraging blind and partially sighted people
 to use it: a win for Adobe, a win for Flash developers, a win for any
 company that has a Flash web site and a win for blind and partially
 sighted web users."
</p>
<p> 
 [Further comments please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i98-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Poor Show:</h3>
<p>  Also on the topic of Flash, Jude DaShiell, a computer programmer in the US civil service from Lexington Park, Maryland,
 had an indignant reaction: "No! At least not the way it gets
 implemented by whoever prepares mandatory training using it for my
 employer. So far there's one persistent problem. Buttons you have to
 click on keep getting put on slides. Screen readers see these slides as
 single graphic objects so it takes sighted assistance to do the clicking
 whenever this happens.
</p>
<p> 
 "My employer is now using alternative media solutions for
 presentations for screen reader users the problem is so bad. What
 they're using are pdf files but at least you can get the text extracted out
 of that trash then delete those files. My employer continues guzzling
 that Adobe Kool-Aid though and until that stops and the employer
 figures out how to prise its data out of the forms it used it's going to
 continue losing the taxpayer's money. But after all who cares so long
 as it's the taxpayer's money not management's salaries that get lost?"
</p>
<p> 
 [Editor's note: for non-US readers, Jude's reference to 'guzzling that
 Kool-Aid' adapts the American expression, 'drinking the Kool-Aid',
 meaning to blindly following a belief.]

<h3 id="i98-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Leopard Displays:</h3>
<p>  Our tireless correspondent, Jude DaShiell, has also written in this month to continue our discussion about support for
 refreshable Braille displays by the new Apple operating system
 'Leopard'.
</p>
<p> 
 Jude provides a link to a list of supported displays, from Apple's own
 website:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/apple1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/apple1</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 And Jude also forwarded a relevant notice from earlier this month:
</p>
<p> 
 "Today, Apple released the Braille Display Update 1.0 for VoiceOver
 in Leopard. VoiceOver, part of the Universal Access family of
 accessibility tech, allows blind or visually impaired users to hear
 what's on the screen. Via the new update, when you connect a
 compatible Braille display, "VoiceOver automatically detects it and
 sends it information about what is displayed on the screen."
</p>
<p> 
 "This update adds new support for certain Braille displays, including
 the HandyTech Braille Star 8, GW Micro BrailleSense, and more. This
 update is available for users of Mac OS X Leopard by using Software
 Update (Apple menu > Software Update) or by downloading the
 installer package from the Apple support downloads site. If you're
 currently using a Braille screenreader under Leopard - or you were
 waiting for support for your screenreader via this update - drop us a
 comment to let us know if the update makes a difference for you."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: News Analysis- Web Accessibility Standards.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Raising The Standardby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 Although awareness of the importance of web accessibility is now
 relatively high after years of struggle by disability campaigners,
 website owners and developers still face a confusing task in trying to
 ascertain exactly what they should do to make their sites accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 There are a variety of guidelines and standards, and the main
 recognised international standard, the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG) from the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI), is now outdated. A new version -
 WCAG 2.0 - might appear next year, but no-one is holding their breath
 since already almost a decade of wrangling and delays has passed since
 the appearance of WCAG version 1.0.
</p>
<p> 
 Into this minefield strides the British Standards Institution (BSi), the
 UK's national standards body, now in the process of establishing a new
 technical standards committee to oversee the development of a
 standard which all organisations will be able to follow in procuring or
 developing an accessible website. It will not in itself set out in detail
 the technical requirements of accessibility, but it will aim to outline a
 thorough process developers can follow to ensure they are taking all
 the right actions at the right time to make their websites and services as
 inclusive as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 The work will build on BSi's existing 'PAS 78', where 'PAS' stands
 for 'Publicly Available Specification'. A PAS is an initial
 specification, developed in a consultative manner, which marks the
 first step on the way to a full British Standard, and indeed many
 members of the team which developed the PAS for BSi will join the
 new technical committee. Chief among these is Julie Howell, head of
 accessibility at web design agency Fortune Cookie and long-term web
 accessibility campaigner on behalf of RNIB and others. Howell drafted
 PAS 78 and is chair elect of the new technical committee 'IST/45'.
</p>
<p> 
 The work will be the culmination of almost a decade of hard work,
 Howell told E-Access Bulletin in an exclusive interview to announce
 the new project.
</p>
<p> 
 "The story starts back in 1999, when four things happened," Howell
 says. "WAI published the first draft of the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines; the UK government published its white paper
 'Modernising government', with targets for moving public services
 online; I was appointed internet campaigns officer at RNIB; and Part
 III of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) came into force, which
 extended the act's provisions to services and service providers,
 including websites.
</p>
<p> 
 "So there was quite a lot going on: noise was being made in Whitehall,
 things were starting to happen."
</p>
<p> 
 The work was taken up by the UK's then Disability Rights
 Commission - now part of the expanded Equality and Human Rights
 Commission - which issued a code of practice on the DDA in 2002
 expanding on its application to websites and then, in 2004, launched a
 formal investigation into web accessibility in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 The commission engaged City University to undertake research into
 1,000 UK websites, published later that same year as 'Disabled people
 and the web'. The research found that only 19% of websites met level
 'A' of WCAG 1.0, says Howell, and that a significant percentage of
 problems experienced by disabled people could not be met by WCAG.
</p>
<p> 
 "Through the research the commission found there was a gap - that
 there was a high level of goodwill to people with disabilities, but a
 failure to act," she says. In all the report made 16 recommendations, of
 which one was the production of new guidance to bridge a gap in
 understanding.
</p>
<p> 
 "Another was to launch a public awareness campaign, which it never
 has," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 It was in relation to the recommendation on guidance that DRC was
 approached by BSi, which said it had a product and a process that
 could help. The results was that DRC sponsored the process of creating
 PAS78 - a PAS is always sponsored, though full standards are funded
 and owned by BSi itself - and the commission turned to Howell for
 advice and support in forming a steering group and drawing up the
 specification.
</p>
<p> 
 "A PAS is part way on the journey to a standard, but it does not require
 consensus, so it can be published quickly," Howell says. "It was
 consultative, we consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, but did
 not require consensus like the WCAG revision process, so it was
 possible to produce within a year."
</p>
<p> 
 To begin with, Howell had to assess what role the PAS would play in a
 field where guidelines already existed. "I was the one with a blank
 sheet of paper, who decided what it should include. BSi and DRC had
 drawn up the scope, but the steering group changed it, because it had
 been intended for developers, and it became obvious to us that we
 already had technical guidelines - WCAG - and what was needed was
 guidance on procurement."
</p>
<p> 
 As the PAS was developed - and there were strict BSi rules to be
 followed, including the Kafkaesque BS0, the standard for writing
 standards - it was redrafted twice by a steering group which had
 representation from a variety of organisations: AbilityNet; BBC;
 British Computer Society; Cabinet Office; DRC; IBM; RNIB;
 Tesco.com; University College London; and the Usability
 Professionals Association.
</p>
<p> 
 At the end of this process, it set out a robust generic process for
 creating an accessible site, emphasising site testing by disabled people;
 the need for organisations to produce an accessibility policy for
 internal use; and publication of an accessibility statement on each
 website site for the benefit of users with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 After a wider consultation process with more than 100 stakeholder
 organisations such as Adobe and WAI, the PAS was launched in
 March 2006. Although the specification was made available by BSi for
 a £30 download charge, DRC bought a licence for open publication so
 the PAS could be made available for free public download from its
 own website (now the website if its successor body, the Equality and
 Human Rights Commission), resulting in a rush of interest that has led
 to download figures of some 54,000 to date.
</p>
<p> 
 BSi rules state that after two years a PAS has to be reviewed with a
 view to becoming a full standard, though Howell says that at first,
 when this deadline was approaching and the institution contacted her
 with the next step in mind, she and her fellow committee members
 were not sure if the time was yet right to move towards a full standard.
</p>
<p> 
 "With the two-year mark is approaching, at first we were resistant to
 talk of it becoming a standard. I felt not enough had been done when
 the PAS was published to promote awareness of it. To have 54,000
 downloads is not bad, but my fear was that we had released something
 that had been downloaded and that was all. It was not necessarily being
 used.
</p>
<p> 
 "On the other hand, with a PAS you always have to explain to
 everyone what a PAS is, whereas people have heard of a British
 Standard. So I was persuaded, but at the same time daunted - while the
 creation of a PAS does not require full consensus, a BS does. There is
 an awful lot of work to be done."
</p>
<p> 
 The fledgling new committee IST/45 will be charged with looking at
 the area of web accessibility in general, including e-commerce and
 social networking sites, with other work beyond the initial BS also
 possible, Howell says. "There might also be leaflets and training
 materials." She is currently in the process of finalising initial
 membership of the committee, with representation confirmed from
 many of the bodies involved with drawing up PAS 78, and others
 invited. Further members will be co-opted to advise the committee on
 an ad-hoc basis as its work progresses, Howell says.
</p>
<p> 
 But the committee's chief task, and its first piece of work, will be to
 draw up the British Standard. Initially to be drafted by a sub-group of a
 few committee members, Howell says BSi would like the standard to
 be based on PAS78 but she is also keen to widen it to embrace some of
 the new types of web service that were not around just a couple of
 years ago when the PAS was drawn up.
</p>
<p> 
 "PAS78 was before Web 2.0, before social networks, before rich
 internet applications. We will have to look at these."
</p>
<p> 
 As with all British Standards, the completed standard will be wholly
 owned by BSi, and therefore, unlike with the DRC-sponsored PAS78,
 there will be a price attached to it, Howell says. But it will be aimed at
 a fairly specialised, professional audience who should be able to afford
 the price, and the committee will also be likely to produce other more
 general materials that might be free, such as additional documentation
 and training.
</p>
<p> 
 The committee's aim is to get the BS out within a year - in the first
 quarter of 2009 - a far swifter process than the seemingly endless
 debate over the creation of WCAG 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 "We've all agreed this has to be fast - I don't want it to be so
 collaborative and consultative that it takes a decade," Howell says.
 "BSi will not let it drag on, and I will not let it drag on. I am a
 disability campaigner. I want to see change."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Conference Report- Dyslexia and the Civil Service.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Premonitions Of Judgment Dayby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 It is impossible to state a definitive number for the percentage of
 people who suffer from dyslexia because there is no single definition
 of dyslexia, delegates heard at this month's conference on Dyslexia
 and the Civil Service.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is a spectrum, a continuum," Rachel Davies, National Institute of
 Adult Continuing Education (NIACE), told the conference, hosted by
 the Adult Dyslexia Organisation.
</p>
<p> 
 "If you set the bar low, 40% may have some indications, but the most
 commonly quoted figures are around 4% for severe dyslexia and
 around 10% for mild and severe dyslexia," Davies said.
</p>
<p> 
 "But it's also important to remember that lots of people who don't
 have dyslexia will find the adjustments that you make useful."
</p>
<p> 
 David Evans, Education development manager at specialist computer
 access firm Microlink PC (<a href="http://www.microlinkpc.co.uk/">http://www.microlinkpc.co.uk/</a>
), said some 74% of disability recorded in the UK is dyslexia-related, making
 dyslexia by far the biggest single disability issue.
</p>
<p> 
 Evans said that research carried out by his company in schools had
 found that the average take-up of software designed to help people
 with dyslexia was around 28% of pupils per day. "I don't know if it
 was the same 28% - we will test for that next time - so the true figure
 of total pupils helped could be even higher. But schools actually only
 budget for about 4% of pupils who need assistance."
</p>
<p> 
 Other factors which could increase the number of people benefiting
 from software designed to help people with dyslexia include people
 with English as their second language (about 18% of entrants to the
 workforce, many of these suffering from dyslexia in their own
 language as well); attention deficit disorder sufferers; people with
 impaired vision; and people who prefer to learn in a more visual way.
</p>
<p> 
 "My inclination is that the true proportion of people who could be
 helped by access software is probably closer to 40%," Evans said. "But
 even if we accept that only approximately 10% of the UK workforce
 can understand and present data much more quickly than they can read
 or write, it is clear that much talent is being wasted."
</p>
<p> 
 One practical definition of dyslexia is simply the condition whereby
 people are able to understand spoken information faster than they are
 able to absorb it through reading or set it down in writing, he said. I
 know one extremely bright individual at Cardiff university who will
 get a first class degree, got three As at 'A' level, and can mentally
 process around 700 words a minute, but can only manage six words a
 minute reading, and even less writing. The average for dyslexia is
 around 20 words a minute.
</p>
<p> 
 "But we can harness technology to enable people to access data at a
 speed which reflects their ability to process and absorb it," Evans said.
 "Technology can help get data into your mind, and out of your head
 and onto paper, at speed."
</p>
<p> 
 Low-cost solutions that can help people with dyslexia use computers
 include colour overlays to alter the colour and contrast of text and
 background. "The difference they can make is stunning", Evans said.
 "A digital one is free, if you want it profiled it is still very cheap."
</p>
<p> 
 Text to speech software including screen-readers has also become
 cheaper, better quality and easier to use in the past few years, he said.
 And voice recognition software, which can be of enormous assistance
 to people with dyslexia as well as those with impaired vision, has taken
 a giant leap forwards with the latest version of 'Dragon' software.
</p>
<p> 
 "When Dragon version 9 came out it was as if we had jumped from
 version 8 to version 80 - it now has 90% accuracy. It actually works
 better the faster you talk," Evans said. "Its processing power is
 awesome, though it needs a good computer to use it. At around £120
 for the basic version, it's affordable, and it can be used with digital
 note-takers such as the Olympus DS-40. I'm not dyslexic, but I use it
 every day."
</p>
<p> 
 Other software tools that can be useful include 'mind-mapping' tools
 that help portray ideas and build documents in 3-D visual diagrams
 rather than as linear notes. "Some of the new mind-mapping tools are
 fantastic, and they can convert back to a nice linear structure at the
 press of a button," he said. "And they are not as conspicuous for
 someone to use as a screen-reader, it is not as obvious that they have a
 disability."
</p>
<p> 
 With all these low-cost technology options available and a growing
 body of research showing how many people could benefit, it is only a
 matter of time before more employers are forced to implement far
 more technology through legal action, Evans said.
</p>
<p> 
 Under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act public sector
 employers must make "reasonable" adjustments to facilities to allow
 access by all staff. "What is 'reasonable adjustment'? The reactive
 definition in common law is retrospective - it is what a judge believes
 was reasonable given the circumstances and the information that was
 available," Evans said. "So what information is available to employers
 at the moment? We know at least 10% of the workforce is dyslexic.
 We know there is a truckload of technology out there that can help, for
 probably less than 1% of the employment costs of the individual. So
 the information is there, it is public knowledge, the resources are there
 and they know people will benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 "So the judge will say - yes, that was reasonable, why wasn't it done?
 There are going to be some landmark cases, this year or next year."
</p>
<p> 
 Some public bodies may say that the money to make adjustments is not
 there in their budgets, but they could go and bid for it from the centre.
</p>
<p> 
 "There must be a cost-benefit analysis, could be technology for £100
 that increases productivity by 20%. It will only take a strong test case
 to change people's attitudes."
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the strongest reason for employers and educational
 institutions to start to make wider use of assistive technology is not
 simply to avoid legal action or to comply with regulations but to make
 the best use of their employees' or learners' talent, improving their
 productivity, Evans said.
</p>
<p> 
 "In my experience, more than 90% of assessments in the workplace are
 compliance driven. It wasn't 'how can we harness this person's talent?'
 It was 'How quickly can we tick a box?'"
</p>
<p> 
 But being 'employee-centred' does not just mean reacting to individual
 problems, he said. "An individual-centred approach is not about
 compliance, employers should be saying 'We ought to do this, because
 we will get more from our staff. It is active talent management."
</p>
<p> 
 In a lot of organisations, it will be a lot easier to take a decision based
 on this kind of high level approach, he said. Research from the
 University of Southampton has identified that nearly 90% of people
 using assistive technologies reported an improvement in their
 performance. "Go back to your unions, begin to ask questions."
</p>
<p> 
 As part of his session, Evans told the story of one 15-year-old student
 whose experiences were both inspirational and sobering. "I was there
 at a school and we were doing some testing with screen filters and this
 boy just went mad. He went crazy, we had to pull him down off the
 ceiling. But he wasn't angry because it didn't work - he was angry
 because a free colour contrast tool did work, and it was so easy After
 20 minutes of using it, he could read.
</p>
<p> 
 "And he said, why has it taken so long to find this? He was angry at the
 time that had been wasted."
