<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Inaccessible Recruitment Websites 'An Emerging Scandal'.</h3>
<p> 
 The inaccessibility of job advertising websites to people with
 disabilities is an "emerging scandal" which could expose companies to
 legal challenge, according to the head of one of the world's leading
 bodies promoting equal opportunities in the workplace.
</p>
<p> 
 Susan Scott-Parker, founder and chief executive of the Employers'
 Forum on Disability (<a href="http://www.efd.org.uk/">http://www.efd.org.uk/</a>
), said this month that inaccessible recruitment sites pose a "huge problem" to jobseekers
 with disabilities, particularly since many employers were now
 recruiting exclusively online.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the e-Inclusion Ministerial Conference hosted in Vienna
 by the European Commission earlier, Scott-Parker cited inaccessible
 online psychometric tests and internet job application forms as two
 examples of features that could exclude jobseekers with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 "If you put a sign up saying no disabled people need apply, people
 would get cross. But thousands of jobs are like that. Surely if an
 employer chooses not to allow a disabled person to apply online, this is
 an employment rights issue?"
</p>
<p> 
 Companies need to ensure they provide alternative routes to job
 application that are taken as seriously as applications received online,
 Scott-Parker said. It was no good providing alternatives if applications
 received via those routes are perceived as second-class, she said.

<h3 id="i108-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Guidelines Create Landmark Month For Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 The long-anticipated publication of new international web accessibility
 standard WCAG 2.0 has coincided with the release of a draft British
 Standard for managing web accessibility, in a landmark month for
 internet inclusion.
</p>
<p> 
 WCAG 2.0 ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/</a>
 ) is the new version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the World Wide Web
 Consortium (W3C), accepted as the main benchmark for ensuring web
 content is usable by people with disabilities
</p>
<p> 
 The new 'recommendation' - the consortium's term for a full standard
 - was finally released on 11 December 2008, nine years and seven
 months after the adoption of its predecessor WCAG 1.0. The delay was
 caused by the W3C's desire to consult as widely as possible on every
 stage of the complex guidelines' development; and to ensure the
 standard is as generic and flexible as possible so it will remain relevant
 as web technologies develop.
</p>
<p> 
 A wide range of implementation and explanatory guidance has been
 published alongside the new guidelines, and W3C says websites which
 met the WCAG 1.0 guidelines should need little or no adjustment to
 meet WCAG 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin shortly after publication, Judy Brewer,
 director of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, said one of the keys
 to WCAG 2.0 was improved flexibility, and an approach which
 emphasises generic outcomes rather than specific technical
 checkpoints. "They apply to all web technologies - we wanted
 developers to have fewer constraints in areas like scripting, and to be
 able to innovate," Brewer said.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile the consultation draft of a new British Standard for
 developing accessible websites has been published on the website of
 BSI, the UK's national standards body (
 <a href="http://drafts.bsigroup.com/?i=245">http://drafts.bsigroup.com/?i=245</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The eventual standard BS 8878, entitled 'Web accessibility - building
 accessible experiences for disabled people', will be based on the
 previous Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 78 (see E-Access
 Bulletin issue 98 - <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=159">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=159</a>
 )</p>
<p> 
 It will not set technical specifications for accessibility, instead offering
 recommendations on upholding existing specifications, notably WCAG
 2.0, and involving disabled people in developing and testing websites.
</p>
<p> 
 Julie Howell, chair of the BSI technical committee IST/45 which
 produced the draft, said: "This standard will be a fantastic tool for
 organisations wishing to understand their responsibilities in enabling
 disabled people to use web content."
</p>
<p> 
 Ironically, many of the comments posted on the draft to date have
 focused on the relative inaccessibility and inflexibility of the document
 itself, and on difficulties with the registration process. Consultation
 continues to 31 January and the release of BS 8878 is expected in
 summer 2009.

<h3 id="i108-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Global Online Accessibility Resource Set For 2009 Launch.</h3>
<p> 
 An online resource of open source, royalty-free assistive technology
 tools, accessible and usable at any time and across the world, is to be
 launched next year by a consortium of more than 30 US and European
 IT and disability organisations and leaders, the European Commission
 e-Inclusion conference heard this month.
</p>
<p> 
 Addressing the Vienna conference Dr Gregg Vanderheiden, director of
 the Trace Research and Development Centre at the University of
 Wisconsin-Madison (<a href="http://trace.wisc.edu/">http://trace.wisc.edu/</a>
), said the rationale for the project was to ensure that the societies of the future did not create a
 global disconnected underclass.
</p>
<p> 
 "Tomorrow will not look like today. IT will be like electricity is today
 - you won't be able to find a place, a room, a vehicle where it is not
 available," Vanderheiden said. "It is like the electric light switch -
 people used to have to carry their light with them, to carry lantern into
 a room. They would have laughed if you had said to them in the future
 you won't have to, there will be light in every room," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 So the world will be one of IT convenience, Vanderheiden said,
 "Unless we have a disability that prevents us from using the default
 interfaces provided, or they are too complicated for us to understand.
 Then we won't be able to operate in the world as it is
 designed...somehow we have to figure out a way that we can
 economically deliver accessibility to a wide variety of interfaces...to
 build accessibility into the internet."
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Raising the Floor' project will seek to address this problem by
 creating a collaborative, international virtual community of businesses,
 public sector agencies, charities and others to create a bank of open
 source virtual assistive technologies, he said. Tools would be
 "localisation-friendly, and culturally open and agnostic," and offline
 access would be possible for those who cannot afford to get or stay
 online, for example using e-book readers downloaded to mobile
 phones.
</p>
<p> 
 The initiative received its first grant in October from the US
 Department of Education and will have its formal launch at the UN
 next year, Vanderheiden said. For a link to a copy of his Vienna
 presentation see:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Interview- Susan Scott-Parker OBE.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Fighting Talk From Taskforce Commanderby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 The inaccessibility of job advertising websites to people with
 disabilities is an "emerging scandal," delegates heard earlier this month
 at the e-Inclusion Ministerial Conference hosted in Vienna by the
 European Commission.
</p>
<p> 
 The source of this stinging rebuke was Susan Scott-Parker OBE,
 founder and chief executive of the Employers' Forum on Disability
 (<a href="http://www.efd.org.uk/">http://www.efd.org.uk/</a>
). In a world where, increasingly, employers are choosing to advertise positions solely online, inaccessible
 recruitment sites pose a "huge problem" to jobseekers with disabilities,
 Scott-Parker said.
</p>
<p> 
 "We see inaccessible psychometric tests, application forms that don't
 work if you have dyslexia. If you put a sign up saying no disabled
 people need apply, people would get cross. But thousands of jobs are
 like that. Surely if an employer chooses not to allow a disabled person
 to apply online, this is an employment rights issue?"
</p>
<p> 
 Combative words, but from a surprising source perhaps? After all the
 EFD, which Scott-Parker founded in 1991, is funded by and serves the
 very companies she appeared to be excoriating. Its 400 current
 members between them employ eight million people, or some 20 per
 cent of the UK's workforce, including many global players such as
 Barclays, whose group CEO John Varley is current EFD president.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin a short while after delivering her
 Vienna speech, however, Scott-Parker said it was in her members'
 interests to realise the scale of this problem and take corrective action.
</p>
<p> 
 "We'd like to tip off members that there might be legal challenges,"
 she said. "It is best practice, if millions of people are not being
 excluded. Firms need to require people like online psychometric testers
 to prove they are accessible before they use them, particularly where
 they insist people can only apply for jobs online, which is increasingly
 the case, even for jobs that don't require computer literacy."
</p>
<p> 
 Companies need to ensure they provide alternative routes to job
 application that are taken as seriously as applications received online,
 Scott-Parker said. It was no good providing alternatives if applications
 received via those routes are perceived as second-class, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Use of inaccessible recruitment sites were not the only corporate IT
 failures to come under fire from Scott-Parker in Vienna. Another was a
 failure by some organisations to make proper and timely adjustments
 to internal IT systems for employees with disabilities or who became
 disabled through the process of ageing or accidents.
</p>
<p> 
 This represented a costly waste of resources: "All the investment in the
 individual fails if employers choose not to make adjustments, and the
 employee moves onto benefits instead of remaining at work," Scott-
 Parker said.
</p>
<p> 
 A third key issue was a failure by employers and the IT industry to
 train IT staffing accessibility issues and the use of assistive technology,
 she said. "People shouldn't be accredited: how can you be accredited
 as an IT professional if you can't adapt a system so everyone can use
 it? And if you've got assistive technology but the IT department
 doesn't know about it, there is no point."
</p>
<p> 
 Training costs could be controlled by building it into the existing
 regular retraining programmes undergone by programmer and
 technicians, Scott-Parker said.
</p>
<p> 
 "In each course they do, there needs to be something about adapting
 for the human. I don't think it would cost much for Microsoft to put on
 [their training] curriculum how their technology could be adapted so
 everybody could use it.
</p>
<p> 
 "We'll never crack this if the IT profession don't know how to use
 accessible technology. All we'll do is have better and better kit that just
 sits there."
</p>
<p> 
 Technology companies have a double responsibility, to be suppliers of
 accessible technology and to be accessible employers, Scott-Parker
 said. And in today's tight financial climate, an integrated approach to
 accessibility could give ICT suppliers a competitive edge, she said. "I
 would like to see the ICT industry itself an exemplar of employing
 disabled people. The timing is now right, because the more disabled
 people you employ inside an IT giant, the better understanding you
 have of the needs of a client such as Lloyds TSB, which employs
 hundreds of disabled people."
</p>
<p> 
 Although the EFD works across all aspects of employment, IT
 accessibility has been placed among its top priorities recently, with the
 creation of a Business Taskforce on Accessible Technology (see E-
 Access Bulletin, issue 102, June 2008).
</p>
<p> 
 To date the taskforce has met three times, and is still building its
 membership, which stands at around 20 organisations including
 Accenture, GlaxoSmithKline, HM Revenue and Customs, the BBC and
 Sainsbury's Supermarkets.
</p>
<p> 
 The group is working with accessibility charity AbilityNet to collect
 examples of the benefits to business of an accessible approach, "We
 are trying to produce a compelling rationale for businesses," Scott-
 Parker said.
</p>
<p> 
 Also in the pipeline, though still in its infancy, is a paper-based audit
 tool allowing major organisations to check where they are on a scale of
 1-5 in terms of their current ICT accessibility practices.
</p>
<p> 
 "It will be a maturity model, from nowhere to excellent, looking at
 business processes and governance systems," Scott-Parker said. "If an
 organisation is at level 1-2, they could face legal exposure. We would
 not expect anyone at level 5 yet: I would fall over."
