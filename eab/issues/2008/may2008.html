<h3 id="i101-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Digital Tv Switchover Help Scheme Package 'Misunderstood'.</h3>
<p> 
 A lack of understanding of the digital TV switchover help scheme
 package for the elderly and disabled has been found in the official
 report into the first live UK digital switchover in Whitehaven in
 Cumbria.
</p>
<p> 
 The Whitehaven report (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/copeland1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/copeland1</a>
 ) is published by Digital UK, the broadcaster-funded body charged with
 overseeing the switchover from analogue to digital TV signals across
 the UK between now and 2012.
</p>
<p> 
 It found that on the whole Whitehaven residents were well informed
 about switchover when it took place last November, with 95% of
 people in the area aware of the process a year before it happened.
</p>
<p> 
 However, while many were also aware of the existence of the help
 scheme which provides a digital set-top box and installation assistance,
 the system of charging for help was not well understood.
</p>
<p> 
 The help scheme is offered free to those on certain benefits and to
 other eligible TV users for a payment of 40 pounds. However many
 people did not realise that the 40 pound charge is subsidised, and
 provides a range of assistance worth far more than the charge
 including an accessible set-top box; installation and advice; and, where
 necessary, the installation of a new aerial (which alone can cost more
 than 80 pounds).
</p>
<p> 
 The misunderstanding of the scheme's value could help explain an
 extremely low take-up of the subsidised scheme, which totalled just
 14% of eligible households, the report finds. In contrast, take-up
 figures of 50% were reported among those on lower incomes who were
 eligible for completely free assistance under the scheme.
</p>
<p> 
 A programme of community engagement was undertaken to in
 Whitehaven spread the word about the switchover and sources of help.
 Digital UK opened four help centres, while the charity Age Concern
 organised over 100 small drop-in sessions in different community
 locations.
</p>
<h3 id="i101-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Web Access Focus Will Shift To Isps, Analyst Predicts.</h3>
<p> 
 Responsibility for ensuring web content is accessible will have to shift
 in future from content publishers to internet service providers (ISPs), a
 leading accessibility analyst has warned.
</p>
<p> 
 "Because the internet is global, regulation will have to shift from the
 country of production to the country of consumption", Kevin Carey,
 director of digital inclusion charity humanITy, told the recent E-Access
 '08 conference (
 <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess08/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess08/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 This means that regulation of accessibility as well as issues such as
 security and child protection will have to pass to the local ISPs
 providing access to the sites, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "The globalisation of production and publishing will sound the death
 knell for accessibility unless we can forge alliances with those
 concerned with security, privacy, child protection and public service
 content to achieve a public stake in the way we filter and receive
 content. But if ISPs are to become pornography, security, virus and
 accessibility police, they are going to need paying through a
 combination of consumer and public sector revenue."
</p>
<p> 
 Some of the costs of policing may have to be borne by the content
 providers and ISPs, he said, but small companies should not be
 expected to pay as much towards making content accessible as large
 firms; and it would also be necessary to take into account the purpose
 for which the multi media enterprise has been established, Carey said.
 "We might allow, for example, that a BBC television channel should
 be required to provide 100% accessibility, whereas a student blog
 should not."
</p>

<h3 id="i101-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Umbrella Specification For Web Standards Published.</h3>
<p> 
 An umbrella specification for website standards, including references
 to usability and accessibility standards, has been published by the
 British Standards Institution (
 <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/">http://www.bsi-global.com/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 124, entitled 'Defining,
 implementing and managing website standards,' covers 11 separate
 categories of website quality, of which accessibility and usability are
 two. It was commissioned from the BSi by website content
 management software provider Magus (<a href="http://www.magus.co.uk/">http://www.magus.co.uk/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The BSi had already produced a more focused specification on website
 accessibility, PAS 78, which is now being developed into a full British
 Standard number BS8878. Julie Howell, Director of Accessibility at
 Fortune Cookie which commissioned PAS 78, has been appointed to
 chair the technical committee tasked with developing the standard (see
 story 01, E-Access Bulletin Issue 98, February 2008).
</p>
<p> 
 Howell told E-Access Bulletin this month that people looking for
 accessibility guidance should look to PAS 78, which "contains all the
 guidance site developers and owners should need on how to ensure
 disabled people can use their sites. PAS 124 references PAS 78 but
 does not seek to build on it."
</p>
<p> 
 And according to Simon Lande, founder and CEO of Magus, PAS 124
 references PAS 78 because the intention of PAS 124 was not to
 "reinvent the wheel". It is the first complete set of website
 specifications of its kind in the world, he said, and was created after
 Magus' research found many large companies either do not have or fail
 to stick to formal technical standards governing their websites.
</p>
<p> 
 The specifications are available for download from the BSI website for
 £85:

<h3 id="i101-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Public Failure:</h3>
<p>  A third of government websites are failing to meet their own accessibility standards, according to a report from the House
 of Commons Public Accounts Committee. Moving more services to
 the central government service portals Directgov for citizens and
 Businesslink.gov.uk for businesses - as the government is committed
 to do - ought to improve the situation as those sites are accessible, the
 report finds. According to 'Government on the internet: progress in
 delivering information and services online', the government has made
 it a priority to consult on how its other websites can be made more
 accessible, though this work may be hindered as "[it] does not know
 exactly how many websites it operates":

<p>  Our Inbox items this month were posted as comments to the E-Access Bulletin Live blog (

 Darrell posted a comment on our recent feature on the five most
 common accessibility errors made by web designers, extracted from
 the local government Society of IT Management (Socitm) publication
 on web accessibility, and written for that document in turn by Robin
 Christopherson of Abilitynet.
</p>
<p> 
 Darrell wrote: "I object to the suggestion in item number 5 [the use of
 website features without an accessible alternative] that an email or
 telephone based alternative to the CAPTCHA is acceptable. It is
 patently unacceptable to be forced to wait anywhere from hours to days
 or weeks for something that is granted our sighted peers instantly if
 only one is able to physically see a CAPTCHA image.
</p>
<p> 
 "At a bare minimum, all sites should now feature an audio CAPTCHA
 playback. There's really no excuse for omitting this feature now that
 services such as ReCAPTCHA.net exist as turn key solutions for web
 developers.
</p>
<p> 
 "At this point, failure to provide at least an audio playback on any
 CAPTCHA represents nothing less than a "no blind people allowed"
 sign."

<h3 id="i101-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Subtle Approach:</h3>
<p>  Another recent blog post from Martin Kliehm, who works as a Senior Web Developer in Frankfurt, Germany and runs
 the web standards and accessibility blog 'Learning the World' (
 <a href="http://learningtheworld.eu/">http://learningtheworld.eu/</a>
 ). Martin referred to the current prevalent approach to website accessibility of measuring sites against the main
 international 'WCAG' standards of level A, AA or AAA and stating
 whether or not they pass or fail the test.
</p>
<p> 
 "I don't think this binary approach of passed or failed is helpful," he
 says. "Just because a website failed level A or AA doesn't necessarily
 mean it is inaccessible to people with disabilities. Also it would be
 interesting how badly they failed.
</p>
<p> 
 "In Germany people often use the 'BITV-Test' [German website at:
 <a href="http://bitvtest.de/">http://bitvtest.de/</a>
 ] based on our legislation of WCAG. It is a well-documented site with
 much discussion of how to apply the tests. For a quick check, only
 three pages of different types are chosen, like the home page, a content
 page, and a contact form.
</p>
<p> 
 "Each criterion is assigned with a severity: major, normal, or minor.
 Starting with a total of 100 points, for each failed criterion either 3, 2,
 or 1 points are subtracted, half of the points when a criterion is
 partially fulfilled. A website is highly accessible when the total is 95 or
 above, well accessible at 90-94 points, and badly accessible below 90.
 Also a few checkpoints can change the result into "inaccessible", no
 matter what the actual score was. Think of navigational images without
 alt-text.
</p>
<p> 
 "So what we have here is a score that can be benchmarked with other
 websites, a more precise result how accessible a website is. I think
 that's a better approach."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Workshop Report- Accessible Publishing.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Are They Receiving You, Loud And Clear?By Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 Public sector bodies should draw up accessible publishing strategies
 that integrate their approaches to web and print publishing thereby
 ensuring dissemination of their most important messages to the most
 relevant audiences, delegates heard at last month's E-Access '08
 conference.
</p>
<p> 
 Katie Grant, director of the accessible communications consultancy
 Raincharm Communications and former publications manager at the
 Disability Rights Commission, told a workshop session
 that'accessibility' is a term used to describe the degree to which a
 device, service or working environment is accessible by as many
 people as possible. Within that definition, 'accessible' has three
 meanings: able to be accessed; friendly and approachable; and easily
 understood or appreciated.
</p>
<p> 
 There are certain key steps which need to be followed within any
 accessible publishing strategy, Grant said. These are:
 - Do you need to publish?
 - If so, which audience or audiences are you trying to reach?
 - What formats are you going to produce?
 - How will the information you produce inform and influence?
 - How does what you publish fit within the overall strategy of your
 organisation?
 - How will the information be disseminated?
 - How do you measure success?
</p>
<p> 
 The task of designing accessible information goes far beyond the more
 obvious and technical aspects such as how information is conveyed or
 illustrated using images, Grant said. It is important to begin by
 considering the audience you are trying to reach even before you select
 a format and design a document.
</p>
<p> 
 "Ask yourself who is your target audience, and did you consider their
 needs when setting up your website, for example? Publishing formats
 should always be based on user research, and a balance struck between
 accessibility and functionality."
</p>
<p> 
 Clearly budget issues will affect what formats can be delivered, and
 how much information can be published, Grant said, but in looking at
 affordability, organisations should look at the cost versus value
 delivered in terms of improved service. A business case for
 accessibility should also investigate the urgency of each type of
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 As part of an interactive exercise during the workshop, delegates
 produced their own examples of issues to consider when developing
 the business case for an accessible publishing strategy. These included
 ensuring there is no ambiguity in stated business requirements;
 developing a flexible and scalable strategy; and to implement constant
 reviews and evaluation to keep up with changes in technology.
</p>
<p> 
 A range of cultural and 'people' issues were also highlighted by
 delegates. These included the need to ensure broad ownership of the
 strategy, with buy in from both production/marketing staff and senior
 budget holders and managers.
</p>
<p> 
 "You need to establish a publishing team at the planning stage,
 involving the people who are going to be producing the work - web
 people and marketing people - and others from across the
 organisation," Grant said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Then to ensure proper implementation, who need to work out who is
 responsible for each bit," she said. "It needs to be built into job
 descriptions."
</p>
<p> 
 "Access to clearly designed, easy to read information should be a
 fundamental right for everyone. Building and embedding an accessible
 publishing strategy into an organisations communications culture
 should be at the forefront of any business planning process.
</p>
<p>

 Headstar Training course, 'Designing for all', designed to introduce

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Time For A New Beginningby Kevin Carey.
</h3>
<p> 
 There is an elegant correspondence between the amount of information
 in circulation and its accessibility which can be expressed in two
 formulae.
</p>
<p> 
 First, that the greater the quantity of information, the lower its cost of
 production; and second, that the lower the cost of production, the
 greater is the additional percentage cost of making it accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Take television. When spectrum was limited, the medium was
 analogue and the labour was unionised, the cost of producing television
 was high; so was the cost of producing accessibility services such as
 captioning, audio description and signing; but the percentage cost of
 these special services was relatively low.

 Now think about the explosion of television since 1990 when satellite
 was introduced and project this forward to internet television: there
 will be no spectrum and therefore no scarcity, and digital production is
 cheap. Smaller and smaller players will find a toe-hold with niche
 products, but the smaller the player, the higher the relative percentage
 cost of accessibility services will become.
</p>
<p> 
 This scenario can be extended to multi media channels and on-demand
 services. So the question is, do we expect multi media providers to
 provide a full range of accessibility services, regardless of their
 economic capacity?
</p>
<p> 
 If we want to look for a rational answer to this question, the starting
 point is the way that television accessibility has been regulated. The
 2003 Telecommunications Act obliged Ofcom to regulate accessibility
 services. It set rational percentages of compliance, taking into account
 the percentage of turnover they would need to spend in order to
 comply. If the percentage was too high, the broadcaster was exempt.
</p>
<p> 
 That is a good starting principle, but it does not go far enough. A
 second factor which we need to take into account is the purpose for
 which the multi media enterprise has been established. We might
 allow, for example, that a BBC television channel should be required
 to provide 100% accessibility, whereas a student blog should not.
 Between these two there are all kinds of information providers who
 need to be subjected to a rational principle in addition to their
 economic capacity. I suggest that the principle should be that the
 degree of accessibility required should depend on the public purpose of
 the information provider. We might argue that a major retailer should
 be under a higher obligation than a wholesale supplier of nuts and
 bolts.
</p>
<p> 
 There is a principle which directly relates both to economic capacity
 and public purpose, and that is reach. If we are going to insist on a
 level of accessibility, it should relate to the number of people likely to
 benefit. This does not simply involve producing a ball-park figure for
 blind and visually impaired people or deaf and hearing impaired
 people; the evidence has to be based on actual behaviour rather than on
 some wild estimate of uptake.
</p>
<p> 
 If we combine the organisation's mission, economic capacity and
 reach, we are getting closer to a rational way of understanding the
 relationship between the supplier and the customer requiring an
 accessibility service.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, we need a new approach to accessibility which is
 proportionate, evidence-based and economically viable. That, however,
 is not the end of the matter. One of the key features of the digital
 information age is that production and publishing are becoming global.
 If regulation is too harsh in one political sphere then companies will
 move.
</p>
<p> 
 This, in turn, means that regulation of content will have to shift from
 the country of origin to the country of consumption, which would
 mean enormous cost shifts from publishers to internet service providers
 (ISPs) and information brokers. If ISPs are to become pornography,
 security, virus and accessibility police, they are going to need paying
 through a combination of consumer and public sector revenue.
</p>
<p> 
 This is an important discussion because the globalisation of production
 and publishing will sound the death knell for accessibility unless we
 can forge alliances with those concerned with security, privacy, child
 protection and public service content in order to achieve a public stake
 in the way we filter and receive content.
</p>
<p> 
 In summary, then, the old game is over. We will no longer be able to
 rely on national or even European regulators, to deliver accessibility
 from the publisher. We are going to have to switch to information
 brokers, distributors and deliverers, working out some mechanism for
 imposing obligations similar to those which no doubt governments will
 ultimately impose for the purposes of national security and child
 protection. We have wasted almost twenty years waiting for each other
 to act and now we are entering very tough times. We need a new
 approach, we need to make a new start. This will not be easy, but it
 will have to be done.
