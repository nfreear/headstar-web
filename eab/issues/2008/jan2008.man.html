<h3 id="i97-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: February Milestone On Road To Web Access Guidelines.</h3>
<p> 
 Another step towards publication of the long-awaited international
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) will be
 reached on 1 February, with the closing of the call for public comment
 on a final working draft.
</p>
<p> 
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the web standards body
 responsible for WCAG 2.0, says the project "may" now be completed
 in 2008. It will have been a long journey: the first working draft was
 published in 2001 and since then eleven different versions have been
 produced addressing more than 2,500 issues raised in public
 consultation. Previously promised publication targets have come and
 gone several times.
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines are the main international benchmark for accessibility
 of websites to people with disabilities. According to W3C, WCAG 2.0
 will apply more broadly to different web technologies as they develop
 in the future. The WCAG 2.0 requirements will also be more testable,
 and better guidance for compliance will be issued.
</p>
<p> 
 The three current levels of compliance - 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA' - will
 remain, although the series of prioritised 'checkpoints' of WCAG 1.0
 will be replaced by 'success criteria' which can be graded by level. For
 example, for on-screen text, a colour contrast ratio of at least 5:1 would
 meet level AA requirements, while 7:1 would meet AAA.
</p>
<p> 
 Most web sites that conform to WCAG 1.0 should not require
 significant changes in order to conform to WCAG 2.0, and some
 organisations have already started to use the draft guidelines, according
 to W3C. Issues and comments on the latest draft may be submitted
 until 1 February 2008, at:

<h3 id="i97-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Uk Equality Commission Gears Up For Action.</h3>
<p> 
 The UK's new Equality and Human Rights Commission is likely to be
 a more effective ally for those lobbying for better access to technology
 by people with disabilities than its predecessor Disability Rights
 Commission, a senior official told E-Access Bulletin this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The new commission (<a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com">http://www.equalityhumanrights.com</a>
) was formed as an interim organisation in October 2007, with its full active
 launch set for April 2008. Covering England, Scotland and Wales, it
 replaces, unites and adds to the work of three former agencies: the
 Commission for Racial Equality; the Disability Rights Commission;
 and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Its statutory disability
 committee is chaired by Baroness Jane Campbell.
</p>
<p> 
 Sarfraz Khan, senior legal officer at the new commission, said the
 work of his former employer the Disability Rights Commission (DRC)
 in the area of championing access to technology would be continued by
 the new body.
</p>
<p> 
 "The new commission offers an opportunity for a joined-up approach,
 not necessarily just considering technology access issues from one
 particular group, or piecemeal, but allowing us to deal more
 holistically," Khan said. "It could pick up on issues that might
 demonstrate multiple disadvantages, for example older people and
 disabled people."
</p>
<p> 
 The new organisation will also have deeper pockets, he said. "It has
 greater resources than the previous commissions individually and
 collectively, which will probably mean it is in a position to do much
 more work, and access a greater number of areas. It also has a broader
 remit, covering human rights, and we will see how this applies to
 access to technology."
</p>
<p> 
 The commission's duties include to fight discrimination in the fields of
 age, disability, gender, reassignment of gender, race, religion of belief,
 and sexual orientation; and to promote awareness, understanding of
 and protection of human rights. Next month, it will publish a
 consultation draft of a three-year strategic plan for 2009-2012 covering
 legal assistance; research; codes of practice; and inquiries and
 investigations.
</p>
<h3 id="i97-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Study Finds Mixed Response To Digital Tv Switchover.</h3>
<p> 
 The 'help scheme' on offer to people with disabilities to assist with the
 UK-wide switchover to digital TV works well, though many users will
 find digital services harder to use, research from the RNIB has found.
</p>
<p> 
 The institute surveyed a group of 30 people with impaired vision in the
 Whitehaven area of Cumbria, where a live digital TV switchover pilot
 is underway. Under a help scheme funded by the Department for
 Culture Media and Sport with the BBC, eligible households, including
 those where people have disabilities, can receive a Freeview set-top
 box with audio-description and other special access features for just
 £40, including installation and some training (see
 <a href="http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/helpscheme">http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/helpscheme</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 In the run up to the Whitehaven pilot, information was made available
 to people in their preferred format on the options available to them. Of
 the 30 respondents to the RNIB survey, seven had already switched to
 digital television before the pilot, and the remaining 23 took advantage
 of the help scheme. All the respondents who used the scheme agreed it
 offered good value for money. Help scheme staff were praised as
 friendly and helpful, although some respondents felt that certain
 aspects of the technology, in particular the audio description option,
 had not been explained adequately.
</p>
<p> 
 But while the respondents thought that on the whole digital television
 is a good thing, and they appreciated the increased number of channels
 on offer, they found that digital television is more difficult to use.
 Currently no digital service offers a set-top box with a voice-output
 menu and the use of on-screen menus make it difficult for a visually
 impaired user to navigate. As a consequence some users are reluctant
 to venture beyond the traditional channels for fear of being unable to
 find their way back.
</p>
<p> 
 RNIB Media and Culture Department Manager Leen Petr&#195;� says voice-
 output technology could become readily available, and is working with
 manufacturers to develop an affordable solution. The decision on
 whether set-top boxes with voice-output will be included in the help
 scheme will be made by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media &
 Sport next month (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 95, November 2007).
</p>
<p> 
 Nationwide digital TV switchover is due to start at the end of 2008 in
 the Scottish Borders and sweep across all regions over five years,
 ending in the Channel Islands in 2013. For more details of the RNIB's

<p>  Following our call for information about the accessibility of Apple products, Jude DaShiell, a computer
 programmer in the US civil service from Lexington Park, Maryland,
 writes: "I'm totally blind and own and use a mac mini computer
 running tiger with VoiceOver on it. I haven't upgraded to Leopard yet,
 but expect to sometime in 2008.
</p>
<p> 
 "The Apple web site, which is important here because Apple sells .mac
 accounts, is inaccessible in the .mac sign up area, [but] this is known
 by Apple and I understand that is something Apple is working to fix.
 People who have problems signing up for .mac accounts can call up
 Apple and get a technician to do it for them while on the phone. A
 reason to get this done is that isync, which is accessible and can copy
 your contacts on your cell phone and save them for you, now does it on
 a .mac account rather than on your local computer.
</p>
<p> 
 "I haven't got all of iTunes working but hopefully accessibility will
 have improved in Leopard. There is now an accessible spreadsheet for
 Apple computers not made by Apple and I've been using that on a trial
 basis. It's a little different from Microsoft Excel, but an Excel
 background will be helpful in learning to use it. The terminal
 environment in Leopard did improve over what it was in Tiger, but it's
 still useable in Tiger.
</p>
<p> 
 "The biggest problem for software accessibility any new Mac user will
 have to contend with is not the operating system accessibility, it's the
 extra software, since not all of [it] is accessible yet. Developers are not
 interested in many cases, so don't use the accessibility resources made
 available by Tiger to make their add-on software accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 "It took three years for the first of the spreadsheet applications to
 become accessible and that spreadsheet comes from a German software
 developer, not from anyone in America. It's called x-tables and you
 need to download the latest beta edition and toggle VoiceOver on with
 command-f5 to see how well or poorly it works.
</p>
<p> 
 Another suggestion would be to go to [the technology access advice
 site] 'ICanWorkThisThing':
 <a href="http://www.icanworkthisthing.com">http://www.icanworkthisthing.com</a>

 and use the VoiceOver link on that page's instructions to set up
 VoiceOver first before doing any live testing of it since those
 instructions optimise VoiceOver accessibility settings. The
 MacVisionaries [Apple accessibility company website]
 <a href="http://www.macvisionaries.com">http://www.macvisionaries.com</a>

 has a sign-up link for a
 <a href="mailto:discuss@macvisionaries.com">discuss@macvisionaries.com</a>
 email list which is one place new users and those not so new can go for
 help and advice." Jude warns that this email list is high volume,
 however.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special Technology Focus- Flash and Accessible Video, Part One.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: In this month's special two-part feature, this section looks at
 the accessibility of Adobe's 'Flash' web video and multimedia
 software, interviewing independent expert Niqui Merret; while the next
 section delves deeper into the accessibility features of Flash, as related
 by the company's own responsible senior engineer Andrew
 Kirkpatrick.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: A Positive School Of Thoughtby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 The multimedia software 'Flash' has been around since the early days
 of the web. Originally developed by Macromedia, now part of Adobe,
 it became one of the most commonly used ways of creating and
 playing video and animation content over the web.
</p>
<p> 
 Flash has become a de facto web standard due to its large numbers of
 users. The Flash player, which allows users to view Flash content, is
 now in its ninth version and is built into many web viewing platforms.
</p>
<p> 
 In the accessibility community, however, the software has not always
 been viewed with pleasure. As a largely visual medium, websites
 which make extensive use of Flash animation and video at the expense
 of text have generally been perceived as completely inaccessible to
 people using text-based access devices such as screen-readers.
</p>
<p> 
 Nevertheless the software's developers have been working hard for
 some time to make it accessible in a variety of ways, such as tagging
 animation content with text.
</p>
<p> 
 Someone who has been following developments closely for many
 years now, and has had a hand in shaping them, is Niqui Merret, a UK-
 based consultant and developer.
</p>
<p> 
 "With Flash, there have been two schools of thought," Merret says.
 "The first is that Flash just cannot be accessible. This prejudice tended
 to prevail in the access community. And when you say it actually can
 do this or that, they say yes well, but it can't do X.
</p>
<p> 
 "But a lot of people are starting to tolerate it now. In the past year there
 has been a huge change of attitude towards Flash."
</p>
<p> 
 This change is attributable to the fact that Flash has now become
 almost completely accessible by most accepted web standards, she
 says. "There is very little now that Flash doesn't do from the point of
 view of access."
</p>
<p> 
 In August 2007 Merret posted onto her blog a list of all the outstanding
 accessibility issues with Flash of which she was aware. The list, which
 was focused on the Flash player which works within web browsers - in
 other words, the way in which the user receives Flash content, rather
 than the way in which developers make the content - was not intended
 to be complete, but after being widely discussed by developers, Adobe
 and others seems to be as near definitive as possible. It has generated a
 great deal of discussion online, and been cited by other influential
 groups such as the Web Standards Project, a grassroots coalition of
 developers pushing for open and accessible standards.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Accessibility in Flash bug and issue list' has two important
 features. First, it is short: there are just nine items on it. Second, many
 of the issues are not actually within Adobe's remit to fix: of the nine, in
 fact, Merret says two are caused by issues within Microsoft Windows
 and related software and interfaces; one is a problem caused by the
 Firefox browser; and one is now fixed. This leaves five outstanding
 issues for Adobe to work on - not that many for a complex piece of
 software which has been scrutinised for years by the demanding
 accessibility community.
</p>
<p> 
 "Adobe has seen the buglist," Merret says. "They clarified one point.
 One bug was caused by Mozilla [the open source producers of
 Firefox], which did not have Flash keyboard access - you can't tab into
 a Flash movie, you have to click on it first. There is nothing Adobe can
 do to fix that. Though a Mozilla developer has since got in touch and
 apologised for it!"
</p>
<p> 
 In contrast, the manufacturers of screen-reader software and other
 special access tools are extremely hard to pin down in discussions
 about adapting products to work with Flash. "Screen reader
 manufacturers don't respond to emails," Merret says. "It is  impossible
 to get them to do anything at all."
</p>
<p> 
 She anticipates that in the long term, all the outstanding problems will
 be fixed, though it does take time to introduce new features, and for the
 results to filter through as new players are upgraded and downloaded.
</p>
<p> 
 In the meantime, other tools are being developed that may try to take
 away some of Flash's user base, such as 'Silverlight', Microsoft's
 cross-platform browser plug-in for video, animation, and interactive
 content that supports various programming languages.
</p>
<p> 
 For the moment however, Flash would appear to have a headstart on
 Silverlight in terms of accessibility, Merret says.
</p>
<p> 
 "Silverlight is not accessible - it doesn't talk to screenreaders, and
 keyboard access is very basic. In Flash, if you tab, you know where
 you are, but in Silverlight, you can't see where you are unless you
 programme it in. Flash is now very accessible by default. But I hate to
 compare Silverlight to Flash, because Flash is version 9 and this is
 version 1."
</p>
<p> 
 There are also other software areas where Microsoft's solutions are
 more accessible than their Adobe equivalents, Merret says. "[The
 website creation tool] Microsoft Expression Web,
 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/">http://www.microsoft.com/expression/</a>

 their equivalent to Adobe's Dreamweaver, complies with web
 standards. Accessibility is built in from the word go."
</p>
<p> 
 In the world of accessibility, nothing is simple.

Section Four: Special Technology Focus
- Flash and Accessible Video, Part Two.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Flexible Guides To A World Of Sound And Visionby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 There are three elements to accessible video content: an accessible
 interface for controls such as pausing and stopping the video; audio
 description; and text subtitles or captions.
</p>
<p> 
 These three elements were reviewed as they related to Flash video, the
 popular web plug-in software, at the recent Techshare conference
 hosted in London by the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The session 'Accessible video with Flash technology' was led by
 Andrew Kirkpatrick, Corporate Accessibility Engineering Lead for
 Adobe Systems. Adobe now owns Flash after buying its inventor
 company Macromedia - Kirkpatrick's former employer - in 2005.
</p>
<p> 
 Flash content has encountered criticism in the past in relation to
 accessibility, but it now covers all the three elements outlined above,
 Kirkpatrick said.
</p>
<p> 
 Using the 'Flex' tool for building rich internet applications based on
 the Flash platform, developers can customise the Flash Player
 interface, adding control buttons and keyboard shortcuts to simplify
 processes and make them more accessible, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Number keys can be used to change sound volume, for example,
 although access to the 'slider' - a visual tab which is dragged along a
 line to track backwards and forwards through a video - is "a
 challenge," Kirkpatrick admitted.
</p>
<p> 
 Moving to the second element of accessibility, audio description, Flash
 can be set up to detect that a screen reader is being used and run audio
 description automatically, Kirkpatrick said. The software will work
 with the JAWS screen reader, for example, as long as it is JAWS
 version 4 or newer.
</p>
<p> 
 'Cue points' can be use to trigger sounds to be played for audio
 description at the appropriate times, and developers can also tweak the
 user interface to add a toggle button to turn audio description on and
 off, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Perhaps the most vital aspect of making video accessible is the third
 element to be reviewed - text captioning and subtitling.
</p>
<p> 
 Flash has always been able to deliver text equivalents to audio,
 Kirkpatrick said, but improvements in recent versions of the Flash
 Player for parsing XML have brought new possibilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The software uses DFXP (distribution format exchange profile), a
 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard for encoding and
 exchanging Timed Text Authoring Format (TT AF) information, which
 is textual information linked to timed points in audio or video content.
</p>
<p> 
 As with audio description tracks, subtitling and captions can be
 triggered by timed 'cue points' created using "ActionScript", an
 object-oriented programming language built into Flash. Caption style
 information can also be embedded. Other options include viewing
 large captions with full-screen video, and the ability to view a
 transcript on its own without viewing the video at all.
</p>
<p> 
 "Anyone with minimal experience with FLVPlayback [the component
 of Flash Professional 8 which allows developers to use ActionScript
 and customise the video player interface] can have subtitles
 functioning in under five minutes," Kirkpatrick said.
</p>
<p> 
 Captioning of video can benefit a huge range of users, and not only
 those with disabilities, he said. As well as the deaf and hard of hearing,
 people who are working in a noisy environment such as a factory floor;
 people in a quiet environment such as an office where they do not want
 to turn up the sound; and people watching video with poor quality
 audio will all find captions useful.
</p>
<p> 
 The biggest challenge with adding captions is the initial generation of
 the text, Kirkpatrick said. Those attempting to caption video manually
 themselves, perhaps because buying in a professional service is too
 expensive, will find that transcription takes between 5 to 10 hours per
 hour of video, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Once a transcript is written, there are automated sync software
 solutions that will match up the text with the spoken word in the video
 automatically. This is much quicker than manual synchronisation, but
 is still not as good as using a professional captioner, Kirkpatrick said.
 And at the far end of the automation scale are voice recognition
 technologies that will generate text automatically from spoken words,
 but these do require correction, often extensively.
</p>
<p> 
 Kirkpatrick played an excerpt from an example of an online captioned
 Flash video created by the King Tut exhibition currently showing at
 London's O2 arena. The video player has been fully customised to fit
 in with the style of the website, and the captions appear automatically
 (see:
 <a href="http://www.kingtut.org//flash/video/tut_cc.html">http://www.kingtut.org//flash/video/tut_cc.html</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Answering a question from the floor about the possibility of
 simultaneously running different kinds of text, Kirkpatrick said: "You
 could have multiple caption tracks with the ability to switch between
 them, for example one for children and one for adults. It can also
 support multiple characters [for different languages] using Unicode."
</p>
<p> 
 In conclusion, he said that Flash and its related tools comply with the
 W3C's WCAG 1.0 accessibility guidelines, and will comply with
 WCAG 2.0 once these appear.
