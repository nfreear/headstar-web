<h3 id="i100-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Launch For Digital Tv 'Easy To Install' Badging Scheme.</h3>
<p> 
 A new scheme to badge certain digital TV products as 'easy to install'
 for older people and people with disabilities has been launched this
 week by the independent research charity Ricability.
</p>
<p> 
 Ricability - the former research arm of the consumer body Which? - is
 running the project in association with Digital UK, the broadcaster-
 funded body charged with overseeing the switchover from analogue to
 digital TV signals across the UK between now and 2012.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Easy to install' research programme will test a wide range of
 digital TV recorders, set-top receivers and interactive digital TV sets
 (iDTVs) to identify those which are easy to install and retune at home
 without specialist assistance.
</p>
<p> 
 Product elements evaluated include packaging, labelling and
 instructions; accessories supplied such as leads and batteries; the user
 interface including on-screen menus and remote controls; the ease of
 first-time installation and retuning; and customer support including
 helplines and websites.
</p>
<p> 
 Ricability has issued its first 'Easy to install' badges to six Freeview
 Playback Digital TV recorders following tests earlier this year ahead of
 the full project launch. The six are the Digihome DTR160; the
 Goodmans GHD1621F2; the Humax Duovisio PVR-9200TB; the
 Technika AEDTR160S7; the Topfield TF5810PVRt and the
 Wharfedale 160DTR. Summary and detailed test reports for the six can
 be found online at:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ric2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ric2</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 In May and June the charity will be testing and awarding further
 badges to a range of set top boxes and iDTVs. The scheme is for self-
 installed products but the chairty also notes that many satellite, cable
 and phone based services like Sky, Virgin and BT Vision will install
 equipment for users, and some electrical retailers will also install
 equipment at a cost.
</p>

<h3 id="i100-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: E-Learning Access Research Project Comes To Uk.</h3>
<p> 
 A European research programme to improve access to e-learning
 platforms and courses by people with disabilities, with a special focus
 on distance learning, is to hold a consultation meeting in the UK next
 month.
</p>
<p> 
 The Accessible e-Learning Platform for Europe (ALPE) (
 https://adenu.ia.uned.es/alpe/) complements the European accessible
 learning programme EU4ALL ( <a href="http://www.eu4all-project.eu/">http://www.eu4all-project.eu/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The UK workshop is being hosted by the Open University in Milton
 Keynes on 7 May ( <a href="http://eu4all.open.ac.uk/alpe/">http://eu4all.open.ac.uk/alpe/</a>
). The project is focused on learning about creating accessible content and delivery,
 while the project's business partners will analyse the commercial
 aspects of the European accessibility market.
</p>
<p> 
 Other partners in ALPE include the leading Spanish IT solutions and
 consultancy Indra, which is leading the project; UNED, the Spanish
 equivalent of Open University; and the Greek research body MetisNet.
 "The ALPE project has been a great opportunity to share findings with
 other project partners to understand the differences between the
 different countries," Christopher Douce of Open University told E-
 Access Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 id="i100-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Councils Urged To Mix Technical Web Tests With User Tests.</h3>
<p> 
 Local councils should carry out both technical accessibility testing and
 user testing of their websites to minimise exclusion of people with
 disabilities, and not just take one or other approach, a new report from
 the local government Society of IT Management (Socitm) finds.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, a special supplement to Socitm's annual 'Better connected'
 review of all UK council websites, examines the reasons behind an
 alarming downward trend in accessibility in 2008. The accessibility of
 UK local council websites fell by almost 50 per cent since last year,
 with just 37 out of the UK's 468 council websites achieved the most
 basic technical standard of accessibility in 2008 - level 'A' of the
 World Wide Web consortium's web content accessibility guidelines
 (see E-Access Bulletin issue 99, March 2008 for further reporting on
 the Socitm findings).
</p>
<p> 
 The society's new supplement says that to avoid future problems
 councils should combine technical accessibility testing with user
 testing. The former is defined as measurable points that allow access;
 the latter as evaluation of actual attempts to perform tasks on a website.
</p>
<p> 
 "A site that offers good technical accessibility might not be usable by
 disabled people, if the layout and other issues do not take their needs
 into account," the report says. "It is not the case that organisations
 should follow one approach or the other. They should follow both.
</p>
<p> 
 "The one approach considers the key technical guidelines that should
 be adopted across the site. The other approach considers the many
 different perspectives of a website that depend on the tasks to be
 undertaken, the specific characteristics of the disability and the many
 different combinations of technology that one might be using.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is quite feasible that any failures in meeting technical guidelines
 may not apply in any single user experience, but they are very likely to
 apply in a significant percentage of user experiences. Equally, it is
 quite feasible that any failure in a single user experience may not relate
 to any of the technical guidelines and that this might be the case in a
 large number of user experiences."
</p>
<p> 
 The supplement also finds that five common errors account for 76% of
 all types of technical accessibility failure reported by RNIB, and that
 removing them would increase by up to 50% the number of technically
 accessible council sites.
 NOTE: For a full report on the five common errors see section four,
 this issue.

 from HTML formatting to PDF as the main way of viewing statements.
 According a recent Radio 4 Money Box programme, HTML versions
 are still available but harder to find:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bbc7">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bbc7</a>
 . In an update last week, the BBC reported that the person who raised
 the complaint with Money Box, Richard Godfrey-McKay, a blind
 solicitor from Perth in Scotland, was now threatening to sue American
 Express unless the problem was sorted out within days. A
 spokeswoman for American Express told the BBC the company was
 "working with Mr Godfrey-McKay to understand the problems" and

<p>  Last issue we published an enquiry from reader Patty Arnold about an apparently discontinued Access Technology
 Primer from the former National Library for the Blind, comprised of a
 series of free online training courses.
</p>
<p> 
 We have since received two helpful responses from staff at the RNIB,
 into which the NLB merged last year.
</p>
<p> 
 Jon Hardisty, Senior Librarian Digital Services at RNIB, said: "I'm
 sorry to say that the Access Tech Primer is no longer available. It was a
 funded project undertaken by National Library for the Blind several
 years ago, and the content was increasingly out of date, as the access
 tech packages covered were gradually updated by the software
 companies. This was perhaps reflected by the extremely low level of
 usage the site was receiving towards the end of its life.
</p>
<p> 
 "RNIB maintains a list of alternative sources of training and advice on
 the technology section of the RNIB website
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology">http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology</a>
), see particularly the 'information sheets' section."
</p>
<p> 
 And Steve Griffiths, Access Technology Trainer at RNIB, adds: "The
 Access Technology Primer has been discontinued.
</p>
<p> 
 "NLB and RNIB merged recently, and as part of that the NLB website
 has been incorporated into RNIB's. As an internal trainer in access
 technology I was asked to comment on the JAWS and ZoomText
 tutorials on the NLB site and my feeling was that they needed to be
 updated. We don't have the resources to do this update, and my
 understanding is that they were scrapped because of this.
</p>
<p> 
 "That's the bad news. The good news is that there is lots of material for
 the applications available from the relevant manufacturers.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="i100-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Design Hurdles:</h3>
<p>  David Bates, Chair of the National Federation of the Blind West Midlands Branch, writes in with a comment on website
 accessibility, particularly as relates to local councils, the subject of
 recent stories in E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 He writes: "Having recently lost my sight I access websites using a
 screen reader, and because I can't read the screen I usually turn it off to
 save power, navigating by listening to the voice, which reads onward
 from wherever the cursor has been placed by the web designer.
</p>
<p> 
 "Most council website staff could easily optimise their own websites
 for blind users by loading a screen reading programme onto their
 computer and thoroughly checking their own website by listening to
 the voice with their computers monitor turned off.
</p>
<p> 
 "They would then encounter the built-in difficulties, including
 continuity problems where a link opens a new page with the cursor in
 the wrong place, requiring several minutes of listening before the
 cursor reaches the chosen section, and trying to listen to the same piece
 a second time by returning an invisible cursor back to the start of the
 piece.
</p>
<p> 
 "Many web designers seem very reluctant to try the navigation hurdles
 which they set for their blind users, preferring to leave such checking
 tasks to blind people who are unlikely to understand the possibilities of
 the accurate cursor location which makes so much difference to
 accessibility. Can the experts design accessible websites, or must they
 be led by the blind?"

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Organisation in the Spotlight- Ricability.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: The Consumer'S Championby Majeed Saleh.
</h3>
<p> 
 With the switchover to digital TV rolling across the UK between now
 and 2012, blind people and people with impaired vision, who
 paradoxically are major watchers of TV, have more to cope with than
 most in finding and installing the best new receiving, viewing and
 recording equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 Although there is a national Digital TV Help Scheme offering
 (relatively) accessible digital TV receiver equipment and installation
 support at a low cost and free to people on benefits, people will often
 still be faced with tough choices about which equipment to choose or
 use when they want to buy outside of this scheme, or share a household
 with others.
</p>
<p> 
 It is fortunate then that one organisation has been testing every major
 piece of digital TV equipment to come on the market for the past three
 years with a specific focus on use by people with disabilities, and will
 continue doing so for some time to come. This organisation is
 Ricability (
 <a href="http://www.ricability.org.uk/">http://www.ricability.org.uk/</a>
), a unique charity whose origins date back more than 50 years to the
 birth of the UK consumer rights movement.
</p>
<p> 
 Ricability's roots are in the Consumer Association (CA) - now known
 simply by the name of its product comparison publication brand
 Which? - the body set up in 1957 by the activist, policymaker and
 entrepreneur Michael Young (later Lord Young of Dartington), who
 also invented the Open University. In 1963 the CA founded a research
 arm, RICA, to undertake research to a high academic standard in an
 eclectic mix of subject areas from estate agents to town planning. But
 the body soon found itself focusing on the specific needs of elderly and
 disabled consumers, a field that was to become its specialist area.
</p>
<p> 
 In the Seventies, RICA's work covered everything from medicines to
 special footwear, invalid mobility vehicles and ground breaking
 research into the sexual problems experienced by disabled people.
 Then a series of 13 comparative test reports launched RICA's central
 interest in the assessments of special equipment and mainstream
 products through laboratory tests and assessments carried out by
 disabled people, an interest which has carried through to today's digital
 TV tests.
</p>
<p> 
 RICA continued to be managed by the CA until 1991 when it became a
 fully independent product research and comparison charity known as
 Ricability - pronounced 'Ry-ka-bility' - with its own board of trustees
 and program of work. Through its trustees Ricability maintains a close
 association with Which?, and the latter still provides part of
 Ricability's core funding. The charity's other main source of funding is
 the Department of Health, and it also receives money for specific
 projects from various other companies, funds and organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 Recent Ricability reports -which are available online as well as in print
 and audio CD or cassette - have included 'Stay in touch', examining
 fixed and mobile telecoms equipment and services for older and
 disabled customers; 'What's new', a guide to the latest home gadgets
 and electrical goods for elderly and disabled people; and 'A guide to
 buying a textphone', for deaf people and people with impaired hearing.
 It will shortly be publishing reports on shopping trolleys and bath lifts.
</p>
<p> 
 In the area of consumer electronics, TV has been its strongest recent
 focus. Digital television can enhance a person's viewing experience in
 a number of ways, and new features such as Audio Description (AD)
 can radically improve access to programmes by the visually impaired.
 However the digital switchover will require many people to buy and
 install new equipment; more channels mean more complex channel
 navigation systems and more buttons on a remote control. Some set-top
 boxes incorporate AD while others don't; on some the feature is easier
 to use than others, some switch the feature off when the viewer
 changes channel.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2005 Ricability won the commission from the then DTI (now
 BERR) to carry out accessibility and usability testing on digital
 television products in anticipation of the digital switchover (
 <a href="http://www.ricability-digitaltv.org.uk/">http://www.ricability-digitaltv.org.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Since then the body has reviewed, recommended and produced
 detailed reports for consumers on more than a hundred iDTVs, set-top
 boxes, indoor aerials and digital television recorders. The government
 commission was renewed in December and testing will continue until
 at least 2009.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'ease of use' research is conducted for Ricability at the Milton
 Keynes laboratory of Intertek RPT (
 <a href="http://www.uk.intertek-etlsemko.com/">http://www.uk.intertek-etlsemko.com/</a>
), a global leader in testing and certification of electrical products with
 whom both Ricability and Which? have a longstanding relationship
</p>
<p> 
 This week Ricability and Digital UK have announced the launch of a
 new badge that will be applied to digital television products to identify
 those that are easiest to install (see News, this issue). Ricability has
 also been consulted over product design, one example being the SKY
 Digital remote control; information from testing is also fed back to the
 manufacturers in order to assist them improve their future designs.
</p>
<p> 
 As everyday consumer products such as television sets converge with
 more sophisticated information and computing devices, Ricability will
 continue to offer a helping hand to people with disabilities in the
 information age.

 of the five most common accessibility errors.
</p>
<p> 
 The society estimates that these five errors account for 76% of all
 website accessibility failures, and it asked Robin Christopherson, Head
 of Accessibility Services at the charity AbilityNet, to describe their
 impact. Robin is blind and uses the popular 'JAWS' screen reader
 software to access the web.
</p>
<p> 
 An edited version of Robin's assessment follows.
</p>
<p> 
 "Common failure 1 is to have no alternative text for images.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is an extremely common occurrence. I visit a website and am
 confronted with numerous unlabelled images. For mouse users this
 'alternative text' is what pops up when you hover over the image. The
 average web page has dozens of images, from photos and adverts to
 'eye-candy' such as spacing graphics and design flourishes. Many of
 these images are also clickable links or buttons, and not knowing what
 these are makes navigation impossible. Imagine trying to drive from A
 to B where the signposts at every roundabout or junction are blank. A
 disaster!
</p>
<p> 
 "Every single image on a website should be properly labelled. You
 don't need to begin captions by saying "Picture of.", as I already
 know it's a picture. You don't need to label 'spacer' or 'eye-candy'
 images (but give these a default caption so that the page still passes the
 accessibility checkers) and, above all, make sure that all images that
 are also links or buttons describe what will happen when you click on
 them, eg alternative text as "Marilyn Monroe - click to read her life
 story".
</p>
<p> 
 "As well as revolutionising the site for blind users, labelled images will
 also help those with dyslexia and literacy difficulties who use text to
 speech software (they hover their mouse over any text or image and the
 content is spoken out). It will also help those with images turned off
 (many hand-held users do not display images) and, last but by no
 means least, Google loves labelled images.
</p>
<p> 
 "Common failure Two is the inappropriate use of JavaScript.
</p>
<p> 
 "JavaScript is used to write mini-programs that are embedded in web
 pages and can enhance their functionality. They are very widely used
 and set to increase dramatically with 'Web 2.0' applications.
</p>
<p> 
 "My screen reader (JAWS) is one of the most sophisticated, but there
 are still many occasions when some uses of JavaScript leave me
 confused or frustrated, roaming at length to discover what bit of the
 page (if any) has changed after clicking that link, or finding that I am
 totally unable to access that shopping cart as selecting that button using
 the keyboard does nothing at all.
</p>
<p> 
 "It isn't enough to offer an alternative for those not using JavaScript,
 thinking that disabled users do not have JavaScript switched on as a
 matter of course. The vast majority of users of assistive technologies
 (such as screen readers, voice recognition, magnification, alternative
 keyboards and mice) can benefit from JavaScript functions as much as
 anyone, with the major caveat that there are certain uses of JavaScript
 that are not accessible to these technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 "The simple solution is to test your pages with these technologies to
 ensure that your particular application of JavaScript is not problematic.
</p>
<p> 
 "Common failures 3 and 4 are errors in simple and complex data
 tables.
</p>
<p> 
 "Thankfully, these days most websites use style sheets rather than
 tables to style and arrange the blocks of content on a web page. Where
 data tables are concerned, however, it is still the case that most are not
 coded in such a way that the relevant headings are spoken by a screen
 reader when moving from cell to cell. I hear '1327' and '1727' with no
 idea of whether these are sales of widgets or notable dates in history.
</p>
<p> 
 "The solution is to make sure that all headings of columns and rows are
 coded using the 'th' tag instead of the 'td' tag. A screen reader will
 then announce these along with the contents of the cell, putting the data
 in context (eg "Widgets sold in June, 1327").
</p>
<p> 
 "And finally, common failure 5 is the use of features with a lack of
 accessible alternatives.
</p>
<p> 
 "Here you are confronted with an inaccessible bit of content or
 function and you search for a way around the obstacle, but to no avail.
 A classic example is 'CAPTCHA'. A CAPTCHA is a type of security
 test used to determine whether the user is human (and so exclude
 automated spamming programmes). A common type of CAPTCHA
 requires that the user type the letters of a distorted image. Since the
 image is by definition unlabelled (as otherwise it can be read by
 malicious software) an alternative (such as an option to register by
 phone or email) is essential.
</p>
<p> 
 "When it becomes clear that you have content or function that cannot
 be made accessible, offer an accessible alternative. For example, the
 Google accounts sign-up process that uses CAPTCHA also has a link
 to an audio version of the code to be entered plus a link to contact
 customer services for those who cannot access either the visual or the
 auditory option.
</p>
<p> 
 "Always remember that an accessible site is a popular site - and not
 just for the disabled community. Research has shown that a site that is
 designed with accessibility in mind is also easier to use by all."
