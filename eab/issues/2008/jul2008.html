<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: British Standard For Web Access 'Aimed At Marketers'.
</h3>
<p> 

 The forthcoming British Standard for accessible websites, BS8878, is

 to be aimed at marketing departments of major retailers and suppliers

 of consumer goods and services, it has emerged.

</p>
<p> 

 At an open planning meeting hosted this week by the British Standards

 Institution (BSi -

 <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com">http://www.bsi-global.com</a>
 ),
 the committee charged with producing the standard consulted a range

 of other academic and technical bodies to ensure the new work will not

 repeat or compete with other guidelines.

</p>
<p> 

 Following the meeting, BSi technical committee chair Julie Howell

 told E-Access Bulletin that given the existence of other technical

 standards for web accessibility such as the international Web Content

 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), it had been decided to shift the

 focus towards the marketing departments and marketers at major

 retailers and suppliers of goods and services to consumers. There had

 not yet been a great deal of information on accessibility targeted at that

 audience, Howell said.

</p>
<p> 

 "There was a strong feeling that we should produce the standard in a

 language that marketers can understand. So what we're doing will not

 be aimed at a technical level - we already have WCAG for that - but it

 will reference marketing techniques, since the marketing departments

 at major corporations are usually where the website budgets are."

</p>
<p> 

 The standard will not be aimed at public sector bodies, Howell said,

 since they were already served by various guidelines including recent

 ones issued by the Central Office of Information (see E-Access

 Bulletin, June 2008 and Section Three, this issue). A first draft of

 BS8878 will be published by the end of August and released for public

 comment in September and October. Publication of the final standard

 is due for April 2009.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Charity Launches Manifesto For Digital Inclusion.
</h3>
<p> 

 More help is needed to ensure the 'struggling seventh' - the most

 disadvantaged 15 per cent of UK society - are reached by the benefits

 of the information society, according to a 'Digital inclusion manifesto'

 published by specialist consultancy humanITy

 (<a href="http://www.humanity.org.uk">http://www.humanity.org.uk</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 Contrary to expectation the so-called 'digital divide' has compounded

 exclusion among vulnerable groups, and while a lot of resources have

 been directed towards the improving the access of the 'final third',

 there is still more to be done for the most disadvantaged groups, the

 manifesto finds.

</p>
<p> 

 The poorest people in UK society are understandably sceptical about

 the benefits that they receive from new technology, it says. The

 government is focusing on online service provision but more than 80%

 of government transactions are undertaken by people who do not own a

 home computer.

</p>
<p> 

 The manifesto stresses the need for action across a range of technology

 platforms, from the home computer to mobile phones.

</p>
<p> 

 Often the IT skills that are provided to disadvantaged people are ones

 at the bottom of the scale which are becoming unnecessary due to the

 progress of automation, the manifesto says. A change in curriculum is

 required to correct this.

</p>
<p> 

 NOTE: For edited extracts from the manifesto see section four, this

 issue.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Disability Body Blasts Eu Anti-Discrimination Draft.
</h3>
<p> 

 A draft anti-discrimination directive from the European Commission

 has been criticised by a major disability lobby group for failing to

 cover technology accessibility standards.

</p>
<p> 

 The commission's proposal, 'Non-discrimination and equal

 opportunities: a renewed commitment', deals with discrimination

 against people on the basis of disability, race, religion, gender or

 sexual orientation and covers non-employment areas such as education,

 social security and health care (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur8">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur8</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 In a statement European disability Forum (EDF) President Yannis

 Vardakastanis said the draft directive omits "important issues for

 persons with disabilities as the concept of universal design, the

 necessity of European and national accessibility standards and the right

 to services ensuring inclusion."

</p>
<p> 

 In addition the document "leaves room for interpretation and will

 create legal uncertainties", Vardakastanis said (see

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/edf2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/edf2</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 The EDF was created in 1996 to give a voice in the European Union to

 Europe's 50 million disabled people (

<p>  An online toolkit for producing policies
 promoting ICT accessibility has been launched by the Global Initiative

 for Inclusive ICTs (G3ict) and the International Telecommunication

<p>  A service allowing blind users of screenreaders to
 report problems they encounter on web pages has been unveiled by

 IBM. The Social Accessibility Project is a collaborative system that

 allows visually impaired users to highlight web page faults such as

 missing metadata, using a shortcut key command. The system logs the

 reports on a central server and alerts sighted users known as

 'supporters' who can then investigate the issue and help correct it for

 future users. A short video explaining the process is available at:

<p>  Discussion has continued on our E-Access
 Bulletin Live blog about the use of inaccessible 'CAPTCHA' anti-

 spam tools by some websites, following our recent feature on the five

 most common web accessibility errors by Robin Christopherson of

 Abilitynet (see E-Access Bulletin, April 2008).

</p>
<p> 

 Tedd Sperling, a freelance programmer based in the US, posted a link

 to a group of different types of 'CAPTCHA' tools he has created:

 <a href="http://webbytedd.com/aa/assorted-captcha/">http://webbytedd.com/aa/assorted-captcha/</a>

</p>
<p> 

 Sperling says: "I realise that the first demo is not acceptable, but do

 any of the other examples work for those with disabilities? Granted

 some will not because they require sight, but blindness is only one of

 many different disabilities.

</p>
<p> 

 "Could a combination of different CAPTCHAs provide a solution, or is

 CAPTCHA just one of the things that cannot be resolved?"

<h3 id="i103-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Tag Precision:</h3>
<p>  James Coltham, Acting Intranet Development
 Officer in the Children and Families Department at City of Edinburgh

 Council, raises another point relating to the piece on the five most

 common web accessibility errors.

</p>
<p> 

 He says there is a slight inaccuracy in the original article, which said:

 "Make sure that all images that are also links or buttons describe what

 will happen when you click on them, e.g. alternative text as 'Marilyn

 Monroe - click to read her life story'."

</p>
<p> 

 But Coltham says: "This is not really correct. The alternative

 description of an image should be the exact equivalent of its

 appearance. So if it is a photo of Marilyn Monroe with no text in the

 image, it should just be 'Marilyn Monroe'. However, if that image is

 also a hyperlink, the title attribute of the link itself can be used to

 describe where the link goes to. I hope this might prove useful to your

 readers."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: News Focus
- Public Sector Web Accessibility Guidelines.

</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Buried Sticks And Mixed Messages
By Dan Jellinek.

</h3>
<p> 

 The new guidelines for UK public sector bodies on 'Delivering

 inclusive websites' (see E-Access Bulletin, June 2008) are a

 bewildering blend of the vague with the Draconian.

</p>
<p> 

 The guidance, published by the Central Office of Information (COI)

 under the reference number 'TG102' ( see

 <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=129">http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=129</a>
 ),
 stipulates that all new UK public sector websites must conform to at

 least 'AA' accessibility standards as specified by the W3C Web

 Content Accessibility Guidelines.

</p>
<p> 

 Existing central government department websites must conform to

 'AA' by December 2009. "This includes websites due to converge on

 Directgov or BusinessLink, unless convergence is scheduled before

 this date," the guidelines state. Sites of all other government agencies

 and non-departmental bodies must conform by March 2011.

</p>
<p> 

 The guidance is also strong and clear on the point of avoiding less

 accessible content formats wherever possible. Content formats not

 covered by WCAG 1.0 such as Flash, pdf and JavaScript "should only

 be used if it is determined that they are the most appropriate for the

 intended purpose. For example, this could be where the proposed

 content enhances the functionality or understanding for the intended

 audience."

</p>
<p> 

 Where such content formats are decided to be essential, "every attempt

 should be made to ensure that the accessibility features of the relevant

 authoring tool are used," the guidance states.

</p>
<p> 

 Other areas covered include a requirement for public bodies to submit

 website accessibility policies to the accessibility sub-group of the

 Digital People Network - a new forum set up by the COI for public

 sector managers working with digital media - by December 2008. The

 guidance also provides advice on planning, procurement, content

 design and maintenance and assessment of accessibility through the

 use of user testing and other methods.

</p>
<p> 

 So far, so comprehensive. But how strongly enforced will the

 guidelines be?

</p>
<p> 

 Though not mandated by law, the guidance warns that "Government

 websites owners are reminded to follow the conditions of use for a

 .gov.uk name (TG114). Websites which fail to meet the .gov.uk

 accessibility requirements may be at risk of having their domain name

 withdrawn."

</p>
<p> 

 This softens the warning contained in a previous draft version of the

 guidelines, which had used the stronger formulation: "websites which

 fail to meet the mandated level of conformance shall be subject to the

 withdrawal process for .gov.uk domain names".

</p>
<p> 

 Furthermore the 'conditions of use for .gov.uk name' referenced in the

 guidance, Cabinet Office document TG114, are vague on accessibility

 definitions.

</p>
<p> 

 They state: "Applications (web, email, etc) using a .gov.uk domain

 name must comply with current UK legislation and support channels

 that provide accessibility for disabled people, members of ethnic

 minorities and those at risk of social/digital exclusion. Legislation

 includes Copyright, Data Protection Act and Disability Discrimination

 Act. Abuse of [sic] will result in the name being withdrawn" (see

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/caboff1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/caboff1</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 How useful is this paragraph? It seems redundant for an official

 document to specify that any form of government activity 'must

 comply with current UK legislation'. And the suggestion that websites

 must 'support channels that provide accessibility' also amounts to

 little, since 'channels' - presumably, meaning media or technologies -

 do not in themselves generally provide accessibility: this depends more

 on how channels are used.

</p>
<p> 

 Perhaps more usefully, the .gov.uk conditions go on to state: "When

 you are using a .gov.uk domain name to deliver a web presence you are

 reminded that websites should comply with the e-Government

 Interoperability Framework, the Guidelines for UK Government

 websites and Framework for Local Government particularly on such

 issues as use of metadata, PICS labelling, accessibility and security."

</p>
<p> 

 Following this increasingly convoluted trail to the 'e-Government

 Interoperability Framework' (e-GIF) referenced here - and last

 updated as version 6.1 in March of 2005 - we find a strikingly familiar

 phrase in paragraph 2.23: "Government information systems will be

 designed to meet UK legislation and to support channels that provide

 accessibility for disabled people, members of ethnic minorities and

 those at risk of social/digital exclusion."

</p>
<p> 

 With e-GIF, however, paragraph 6.25 contains some sterner warnings

 associated with a failure to comply, namely that: "If a system fails the

 test on any of the aspects listed above, then a migration strategy will

 need to be produced and agreed by the e-Government Unit.Failing to

 comply and the absence of an acceptable migration strategy will lead to

 the following courses of action:

</p>
<p> 

 "- compliance with the e-GIF is one of the criteria that will be used

 when assessing/evaluating departmental e-business strategies and

 deciding on the release of funding by the e-Government Unit and HM

 Treasury.

</p>
<p> 

 "- new systems failing to comply with the e-GIF will not get project

 approval or funding from the appropriate bodies within their

 organisations;

</p>
<p> 

 "- systems seeking to link to Directgov, the Government Gateway or

 the Knowledge Network and failing to comply with the e-GIF will be

 refused connection;

</p>
<p> 

 "- suppliers who are not prepared to meet the e-GIF specific

 requirements or equivalents.will not meet [procurement]

 specifications."

</p>
<p> 

 Clearly here, at last, are some hefty sticks with which to beat those

 creating inaccessible websites. It is a shame, however, that they are

 buried in a trail of paperwork two documents removed from 'inclusive

 websites'.

</p>
<p> 

 Some rationalisation of all this advice is likely to be needed if the

 laudably high accessibility levels stipulated in the new guidance are

 ever to come close to realisation.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Opinion
- Digital Inclusion Manifesto.

</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Helping Hand For The 'Struggling Seventh'.
</h3>
<p> 

 Last month the digital inclusion charity and consultancy HumanITy

 published its Digital Inclusion Manifesto (see also news, this issue).

 We reproduce below an edited summary of the document:

</p>
<p> 

 Contrary to many Utopian predictions in the mid 1990s, the growth in

 the ownership of digital technology has had a disappointing impact on

 the 'Final third' of less advantaged people in our society, and even

 more so on what could be termed the 'Struggling seventh', the most

 disadvantaged 15 per cent of the population.

</p>
<p> 

 This manifesto sets out a broad range of proposals for dealing with the

 major outstanding problems in e-inclusion, emphasising the necessary

 shift from consumption to production and the need for a multi-platform

 approach.

</p>
<p> 

 Often new, major technologies are regarded as panaceas but they

 frequently create or exacerbate socio-economic differentials. This

 expectation greeted cheap, personal computing but the evidence of its

 real effectiveness has been limited; it has not been fully used in its

 areas of key capacity such as the enablement of creativity and

 convergence with broadcasting. Policy makers were aware of a

 potential 'digital divide', but thought people could be 'trained out' of it.

 This strategy has failed, partly because of a lack of incentive and an

 emphasis on skills rendered redundant by automation at the expense of

 emerging skills such as digital photography.

</p>
<p> 

 Poorer citizens have been rightly sceptical of the internet's benefits,

 seeing it as 'top down' and not relevant to their needs. The

 concentration on the PC-based platform and the problems of usability

 and accessibility of e-government sites have been serious obstacles to

 users; more than 80% of government transactions are undertaken by

 people without a home PC.

</p>
<p> 

 A neglect of 'soft skills', an emphasis on autonomous consumption

 rather than collaborative creation and a limited vision of creativity

 have all held back the benefits of the digital society. Government needs

 help to understand these phenomena.

</p>
<p> 

 Although there has been some political concentration on the 'final

 third', we are left with the 'Struggling seventh' which needs its own,

 resource-intensive policy agenda.

</p>
<p> 

 Each of our recommendations below is matched by a proposed strategy

 or project, listed separately under humanITy's partnership agenda,

 which can be found within the full manifesto on the web.

</p>
<p> 

 - Government needs help to make its services more usable by the vast

 majority of its service users; this means abandoning its underlying bias

 in favour of the PC platform.

</p>
<p> 

 - Government needs help in understanding the limited impact of the

 information revolution on behaviour; its potential in the area of

 collaboration and creativity; and its effect on the education system.

</p>
<p> 

 - The current model of intellectual property which rates all products,

 regardless of their economic value, in the same way, needs radical

 reform.

</p>
<p> 

 - Government needs help to integrate the most difficult cases (the

 'Struggling seventh' 15% of the population) but this will need a high

 concentration of effort beyond that reachable using government

 resources. This will require new ways of working with non-

 governmental organisations.
