<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Democracy Websites 'Inaccessible To Audio Browsers'.</h3>
<p> 
 Many government, politics and news websites present significant
 barriers to  web users with disabilities using special access
 technologies such as text to speech convertors, delegates heard at last
 week's E-Democracy '08 conference hosted by Headstar
 (<a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/edemocracy08/">http://www.headstar-events.com/edemocracy08/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Robin Christopherson, head of accessibility at technology access
 charity AbilityNet, presented a live audio demonstration of many of the
 difficulties that blind web users experience.
</p>
<p> 
 Among the sites he examined was the recently revamped Number 10
 Downing Street website, which while relatively accessible in many
 ways, still has various untagged links which read simply 'click here',
 offering the audio browser no clue as to what lies behind. The website
 also features auto-start videos, with unlabelled control buttons, so that
 blind users are confronted with video noise drowning out their own
 audio controls and cannot work out how to turn it off.
</p>
<p> 
 The use of 'Captcha' is an increasing problem for audio web users,
 Christopherson said (see our previous coverage at:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=183">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=183</a>
). Captcha seeks to prevent automated 'spam' software from registering accounts or filling in web
 forms by presenting a pattern of distorted letters and numbers that only
 sighted humans can decode.
</p>
<p> 
 Some captcha systems now offer 'audio captcha' alternatives for
 screen-reader users allowing blind users for example to hear a spoken
 code. Google is an example which uses an embedded QuickTime
 sound sequence to play a garbled numerical code over background
 noise which the listener is required to decipher in a similar way to the
 visual system
 (https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount?service=mail).
 However, these audio captcha files are also incomprehensible, as
 Christopherson demonstrated live to much amusement. In an attempt to
 foil audio recognition software, the sounds are so distorted that they
 cannot be recognised by humans either, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 A third option offered by Google to contact the site's owners directly
 for assistance did not work either: when Christopherson was eventually
 contacted two days after applying for this option he was informed that
 everyone had to register online.
</p>
<h3 id="i107-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: 'Digital Mentor' Trials Form Part Of Draft Inclusion Plan.</h3>
<p> 
 The government is to pilot a 'digital mentors' scheme to help people in
 deprived areas use technologies such as websites, podcasts and digital
 photography to make their voices heard, collaborate and improve
 access to services.
</p>
<p> 
 The initiative forms part of a new action plan for digital inclusion (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/action2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/action2</a>
 ), launched by Digital Inclusion minister Paul Murphy and the
 department of Communities and Local Government (CLG).
</p>
<p> 
 An estimated 17 million people over the age of 15 are not using
 computers and the internet, and there is a strong link between digital
 and social exclusion and disabled people with disabled people among
 those most excluded from the digital technologies at the heart of the
 developing knowledge economy, the plan says.
</p>
<p> 
 Referring to the findings of the disability rights commission in 2007
 the consultation says that of all people in Britain without any formal
 qualifications, over one-third were disabled, and that of all people of
 working age out of work, 40 per cent had a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 A proposed new charter for digital inclusion aims to tackle the barriers
 to citizen engagement with technology including lack of confidence,
 awareness, skills and support and the availability of infrastructure.
</p>
<p> 
 One initiative referred to in the consultation is the government funded
 development of 'sign video', a deaf and sign language led social
 enterprise providing instant and high quality sign language interpreting
 via videophone (<a href="http://www.significant-online.co.uk/">http://www.significant-online.co.uk/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The consultation also examines the indirect benefits that can be gained
 from uses of technology by public bodies on behalf of the
 disadvantaged. It says there is a risk some parts of government are not
 fully exploiting the opportunities available including to integrate
 services across government to support complex needs and reduce the
 amount of contact citizens need to have with government.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition to the charter the consultation announces the government's
 intention to establish the position of a digital inclusion champion to
 work independently with a taskforce of experts to provide strategic
 leadership and expert advice across all sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 Consultation on the draft action plan runs until 19 January 2009, and
 CLG is separately inviting tenders for organisations and consortia
 interested in participating in the digital mentors scheme, hosting a
 workshop for those interested in London on 19 November (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/dm1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/dm1</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i107-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Paper Urges Better Integration For Assistive Technologies.</h3>
<p> 
 A range of emerging technologies integrated with existing solutions
 could offer blind people and others with disabilities new ways of
 solving their everyday problems, according to a paper from Kevin
 Carey, director of the digital inclusion charity humanITy
 (<a href="http://www.humanity.org.uk">http://www.humanity.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The paper was presented at a recent inclusive digital economy
 conference at the University of York. In it Carey says: "There is
 enough technology to assist us with most of our problems but it is not
 integrated in the right way. If we spent more time, energy and money
 integrating rather than thinking up clever new, specialised and
 expensive assistive technologies, we would all be better off."
</p>
<p> 
 For example in the future, modular user interfaces "will allow us to
 couple a large, portable screen with a small mobile telephone, bring the
 sound of a television into a remote controller or cable-free ear phones,
 allow the use of a large screen to 'blow up' an image or show a small
 part of it in great detail."
</p>
<p> 
 And a combination of satellite and voluntary surveillance technologies
 such as webcam networks could be used "to transmit highly localised
 audio information, so that I can ask 'Where am I?' and receive an
 immediate answer," Carey says.
</p>
<p> 
 Other potentially useful new technologies include:
</p>
<p> 
 - hand-held devices to calculate whether it is safe to cross a street on
 the basis of the distance and speed of vehicles;
</p>
<p> 
 - 'Stereoscopic Lithographic Apparatus' (SLA) or 'fast prototyping'
 technologies [whereby objects are created or 'printed' live in three
 dimensions by building them up in layers of resin] to add a new
 dimension to tactile graphics and model making which will probably
 prove to be more valuable than the use of haptic force feedback;
</p>
<p> 
 - high definition data transmission through enhanced broadband and
 HDTV will transmit unmixed audio so that up to 32 parallel tracks can
 be differentiated, allowing more scope both to alter scale and
 deconstruct the layers of images.
</p>

<p>  Roger Wilson-Hinds, Director of Screenreader.net, entrepreneur and long-time E-Access Bulletin reader,
 writes in to get some thoughts off his chest following last issue's report
 that older people with impaired vision are disadvantaged in the
 workplace.
</p>
<p> 
 "Sometimes I feel very frustrated. Many times during the current issue,
 I read that things must change. I also read that RNIB has discovered
 that older visually impaired people are more disadvantaged in the
 labour market.
</p>
<p> 
 "Well, there's a surprise! I worked in the Ministry of Labour in the
 1960s and the same research discovered the same thing. Isn't it time we
 really made changes and stopped researching the bleeding obvious?
 Seeing is pretty useful at work and the reality is that very few jobs can
 be done totally without sight.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's kind of cosy to keep repeating the old clich&#195;�s every few years, but
 real change only comes when visually disabled individuals make a
 supreme effort to kick the cushy benefit trap and fight the battles of the
 work-place.
</p>
<p> 
 "I am as a statistic 68, hard of hearing and blind. As a person I work
 hard, enjoy every day and do a bit of good in the world too. My
 company delivers free talking software so that blind people anywhere
 can use a modern computer. And we have learned to fund it without
 whingeing and begging.
</p>
<p> 
 "Thankfully, there are many like me who just get on with it. I read the
 other day of a partially sighted couple who have launched Easy2See -
 greetings cards in a style which enabled older people with poor sight to
 be able to read the message and see the pictures. That's change and
 much better than the couple moaning and deploring the state of the
 labour market. OK. I feel less frustrated now and at least I have said
 something different."

</p>
<p> 
 Cost is the main driver, since open source software has few of the costs
 and licensing restrictions of traditional software. However, the area is
 complex, and the savings analysis - taking into account training, full
 cost of ownership, and other issues - can lead to confusion.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Focus- Access To The 2012 Olympics.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Running To Catch Upby Stephen Duckworth.
</h3>
<p> 
 Planning for the 2012 Olympic games in London began some time ago,
 and there are many considerations that have been sadly ignored by
 previous hosts when it comes to making the games accessible to people
 with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility issues relate not just to disabled spectators, but also
 disabled athletes. What are we doing for these groups? For example, is
 there technology that can help? I remember going to the Bird's Nest
 stadium in Beijing and watching the blind sprinters running with their
 guides. When they had run the 100-metre race and crossed the
 finishing line, they didn't have a clue whether they had come first,
 second or third. Is there an electronic wrist band that they could have
 that would indicate to them where they had come as they crossed the
 line? Surely it is technically possible to let them know.
</p>
<p> 
 Of course, their guide was a few paces behind as they crossed the line,
 because those are the rules, and he or she would tell them, and you
 would see a sense of euphoria or disappointment depending on where
 they had come.
</p>
<p> 
 In relation to the other customers, the paying customer and a
 significantly large number of non-paying customers. They are known
 as the Olympic or Paralympic family. They are treated like gods by the
 organisation, because essentially, without them, the host city would not
 have got the event.
</p>
<p> 
 What I was surprised about - because I became a member of the
 Paralympic family when I went to Beijing because of my involvement
 with London 2012 - is the red-carpet treatment that you get if you
 happen to belong to that family, and how there's a lower standard of
 treatment if you remove that particular badge - as I did for one day -
 and try and get in as a bog-standard punter, as it were. The disparity of
 treatment between the two types of customer was quite appalling, and I
 hope that, in 2012, we can get it right for both customer groups.
</p>
<p> 
 It's critical really because, in Beijing, there were very few local
 Chinese disabled people attending events. I saw a couple of elderly
 Chinese people who looked fairly affluent compared to the people that
 you would see out on the street, but very few disabled people in China
 attended the events at the Paralympic Games, and I am told also the
 Olympic Games.
</p>
<p> 
 I think that, when the event comes to London, at least 50 per cent of
 the spectators will be London-based. The other spectators in Beijing,
 the other disabled spectators in Beijing, were other athletes. So we are
 going to see double the number of disabled spectators than we were
 seeing in Beijing.
</p>
<p> 
 Now, the way that China overcame the problem of accessibility to
 technology and other issues was through their volunteers. They had 1.2
 million volunteers. We are looking at having roughly about 60 or
 70,000 in this country. I am told, also, that of those volunteers
 approaching half of them were either police or the secret service! And
 they wore different-coloured hats, that's the way that you could tell.
</p>
<p> 
 In some Beijing venues, platform stair-lifts were required to enable
 disabled people to enter the facility. On at least one occasion the lift
 broke, so it did take an awful long time to get in and out of that
 building. The reason being is that I used quite a peculiarly heavy
 wheelchair, but as technology develops in wheelchair design, electric
 powered wheelchairs at least will become heavier and heavier. We are
 hoping not to require this sort of platform lift going up a flight of steps
 technology in London because we are designing it in as we go along.
</p>
<p> 
 What we need to do in everything that we think about is design out the
 disabling barriers. How do you do that? One example is that of chip
 and PIN technology. The British banking association commissioned
 my organisation to develop a system to consult with disabled people
 about how to make chip and PIN technology as accessible as possible.
 We ran 35 focus groups, with 10 disabled people in each group, all of
 different impairment types all over the country, 350 people in total, to
 consult about the design of chip and PIN technology.
 So remember what disability is. It's nothing to do with our impairment.
 It's to do with the way that engineers, architects and others have
 historically built in barriers that restrict our opportunities to
 participate
 as equal citizens. Barriers that we feel we have a right not to encounter.
</p>
<p> 
 Now when we design and develop technologies for people, we have
 heard talk already about the digital divide. So as well as thinking about
 the design and development of the new technologies we have got to
 think about ways in which we develop that technology, to encourage
 users who are at the bottom of the ditch to engage with it.
</p>
<p> 
 Because otherwise we're only going to develop technologies for the
 more motivated, active disabled people who are doing things. The vast
 majority of disabled people still stuck in their passive and medical
 mode of thinking will not gain access to opportunities.
