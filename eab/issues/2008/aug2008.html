<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Beijing Games Website Inaccessible On Multiple Counts.
</h3>
<p> 

 The website for the Beijing Olympics is not accessible to people with

 disabilities, a leading accessibility expert has told E-Access Bulletin.

</p>
<p> 

 With the games in full swing this month, their official website which

 include a full results service could be among the most visited sites in

 the world (<a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/">http://en.beijing2008.cn/</a>
). But Henny Swan, senior web
 accessibility consultant at the RNIB, said the service is inaccessible in

 a number of key ways.

</p>
<p> 

 "There are.no text alternatives for multimedia which means many

 people, including mobile users, will be locked out of content. New

 windows also seem to open from within Flash movies, which is not

 only an accessibility but also a usability issue." Other findings include

 instances of animation that fails to stop moving after three seconds, she

 said. "This can be a distraction for people with reading problems or

 people with low vision.

</p>
<p> 

 Last year Swan undertook an initial advance study of the accessibility

 of the Beijing Olympics site, then still under development. While the

 findings of her work were not all negative, the indications at that time

 were that various improvements were needed before the website would

 meet even the basic level of compliance with international Web

 Content Accessibility Guideline.

</p>
<p> 

 Returning to the site this month, she said there had been some

 improvements, although "where one issue may have been fixed, others

 have taken its place." Overall her findings indicate that the organising

 committee for the Beijing games seem not to have developed a clear

 accessibility plan for the website.

</p>
<p> 

 Olympic websites have a mixed history in terms of accessibility. The

 site for the 2004 games in Athens raised few complaints, but the

 organisers of the 2000 Sydney Olympics were successfully sued for

 failure to make their website comply with accessibility standards.

</p>
<p> 

 NOTE: For our full report on the accessibility of the Beijing 2008

 Olympics website see section three, this issue.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Mobile Browsing Barriers Linked To Accessibility.
</h3>
<p> 

 Two new draft documents relating to accessibility and the future of the

 web have been published in the past month the World Wide Web

 Consortium (W3C - <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 The first, 'Shared web experiences: barriers common to mobile device

 users and people with disabilities', notes that many of the barriers

 faced by internet browsers on mobile devices are the same as those

 experienced by people with disabilities. The document provides

 examples of the barriers of access to web content for both sets of users

 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences">http://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/experiences</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 The second draft forms part of a series of guidelines from the

 consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative, the 'Accessible Rich

 Internet Applications suite', covering accessibility of advanced website

 functionality for disabled users.

</p>
<p> 

 The draft provides an "abstract model" for accessible interfaces which

 can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web

 content and applications (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 W3C is the body which produces standards which govern the web,

 including the main international measures for accessibility, the Web

 Content Accessibility Guidelines. The consortium will now refine the

 new drafts before publication in their final version.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Publishers Back Accessible Learning Materials Database.
</h3>
<p> 

 A web database helping UK education institutions to obtain learning

 materials from publishing houses in accessible formats has been

 launched by educational IT access agency TechDis.

</p>
<p> 

 TechDis is funded by JISC, the education sector's Joint Information

 Systems Committee, to support the sector in achieving greater

 technology inclusion. In an audio interview or 'podcast' published on

 the JISC website, TechDis director Sal Cooke said the Publisher

 Lookup UK service (<a href="http://www.publisherlookup.org.uk">http://www.publisherlookup.org.uk</a>
) had been
 developed in partnership with the Publishers Association.

</p>
<p> 

 The website allows people to search an online database in which

 publishers have entered a single point of contact for library staff or

 other staff seeking to support students with learning difficulties to

 obtain alternative formats. It is thought to be the first resource of its

 kind in Europe, Cooke said, though a similar service already exists in

 the US (<a href="http://www.publisherlookup.org/">http://www.publisherlookup.org/</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 "It's been quite hard for library teams to be able to know who in a

 publisher is the right person to speak to, how the library staff should

 request their materials, is it reasonable to ask for example for a word

 document, or what are the sorts of things they can ask for," Cooke said.

</p>
<p> 

 Help in accessing materials in different formats would not only benefit

 people with learning difficulties or disabilities but a wide range of

 other students such as those with different learning styles or those who

 do not have English as first language and may prefer to listen to a text,

 she said. The podcast can be accessed at:

<h3 id="i104-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Further CAPTCHA:</h3>
<p>  Discussion is still ongoing on our E-Access
 Bulletin Live blog about the use of inaccessible 'CAPTCHA' anti-spam

 tools by some websites.

</p>
<p> 

 Stuart Harrison of Lichfield District Council wrote: "We had loads of

 problems with spam on our contact form - some of it quite offensive,

 and, as some of it was going directly to frontline staff with

 considerably thinner skin than me, I had to do something about it."

</p>
<p> 

 The solution Stuart came up with was not to use a traditional

 CAPTCHA, but to use PHP to generate two numbers, one between 1

 and 50, and another between 1 and 5, and ask users to write down the

 total of the two added together when they submit the form.

</p>
<p> 

 "The second number of the first number never goes beyond 5, so the

 sum's answer never goes beyond the next 10 digit range (to make the

 sum easier)", he says. "This is all wrapped in a label, so screenreader

 users can see the link between the question and the form, and I've

 never had another bit of spam since!

</p>
<p> 

 "The only thing that worries me is that this might lock out users with

 poor numeracy - am I being too cautious? Here's the form for

 reference":

 <a href="http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/feedback2.php">http://www.lichfielddc.gov.uk/site/custom_scripts/feedback2.php</a>

</p>
<p> 

 Henry French from Access Journal at RNIB responds: "Should the

 whole idea of CAPTCHAs as a concept be abandoned? It seems that

 few web designers know about alternatives, especially for blind and

 partially sighted people. But even if we attempt to educate more

 designers about alternative CAPTCHAs, is spam software not going to

 soon improve to the point that it is too smart for CAPTCHAs anyway?

</p>
<p> 

 "My understanding has always been.that the standard CAPTCHA -

 obscure letters on a busy background - was introduced to beat software

 that could read standard text and 'know' how to fill in a form based on

 replicating a piece of text. This is why web designers do not use alt text

 tags - the same software could read that alt text and fill in a form.

</p>
<p> 

 "But I thought that artificial intelligence was moving forward quickly,

 including in the abilities of programs to understand images and audio.

 Stuart above seems to have found a good idea, but I wonder whether

 programs will soon be able to 'think' around this solution, or failing

 that, bombard developers like him with every potential solution to a

 question CAPTCHA.

</p>
<p> 

 "Am I being crazily futuristic? Or should we look forward to a future

 in which we are all - regardless of ability to interact with CAPTCHAs -

 left waiting for hours or days for a human to authenticate online forms?

 I could ask if there will be programs in the future which forge online

 forms and then interact with authenticators, over the phone for

 example. But that's crazy talk."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Web Accessibility
- Beijing Olympics.

</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Revisiting The Errors Of The Past
By Majeed Saleh.

</h3>
<p> 

 The Olympic Games are currently being followed avidly by sports

 fans, journalists and politicians worldwide, many of them using the

 official Beijing 2008 website (<a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/">http://en.beijing2008.cn/</a>
), the most
 comprehensive source of information on events.

</p>
<p> 

 Given the huge global interest the Olympics always stimulates, the

 demands and expectations on the Games website are high, and

 designing a site to please everyone is always going to be tough. Where

 accessibility for people with disabilities is concerned, however,

 previous organisers have not always got it right.

</p>
<p> 

 In one of the most celebrated legal cases ever to take place in any

 nation concerned with web accessibility, Bruce Maguire, a blind

 Australian web user, successfully sued the organisers of the 2000

 Sydney Games for not only failing to produce an accessible website

 but for refusing to make the changes required that would have enabled

 him and other blind users to use the website.

</p>
<p> 

 In a damning indictment, the Australian Human Right and Equal

 Opportunities Commission said the Sydney Games organising

 committee SOCOG "never seriously considered the issue and only

 when the hearing was imminent did it attempt to support its rejection

 of the complainant's complaint by resort to a process which was both

 inadequate and unconvincing." The committee was ordered to pay

 Maguire 20,000 Australian Dollars (for our reports on this important

 case see E-Access Bulletins issues 9-11, September to November

 2000; plus issue 17, May 2001. These is a also an excellent report on

 the affair on web access expert Joe Clark's archive website at

 <a href="http://contenu.nu/socog.html">http://contenu.nu/socog.html</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 Four years later, with the Greek organisers eager not to fall into the

 same trap, the site for the 2004 games in Athens was designed with

 accessibility to the fore, and few complaints were raised. But now the

 spotlight has turned on China, and the signs are that the Beijing

 organisers have taken a less thorough approach, and failed to heed the

 lessons of the past.

</p>
<p> 

 Last year Henny Swan, senior web accessibility consultant at the

 RNIB, conducted an initial study of the accessibility of the official

 Beijing Olympics website. At the time the site was far from reaching

 its final state and while the signs for accessibility were not all bad, the

 indications were that a range of improvements would be needed before

 the site would meet even the basic level of compliance with the

 international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.

</p>
<p> 

 Among the positives picked up last year, Swan cited an attempt to

 provide ALT text to images and a fairly logical heading structure. But

 the site also displayed many accessibility failures such as overuse of

 animated images; some missing ALT text; lack of alternatives for

 multimedia; inadequately described links, for example using just the

 one word 'more'; poor mark-up of data tables; inaccessible animated

 Flash objects; fixed font sizes;  and extensive use of JavaScript without

 alternatives (see

 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/beijing1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/beijing1</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 So how far has the site been improved in the intervening period?

</p>
<p> 

 Swan told E-Access Bulletin this week that, in the year since her initial

 assessment of the site, some of these issues have been corrected. For

 example, it is now possible to adjust the font size on pages. However,

 she said: "where one issue may have been fixed, others have taken its

 place."

</p>
<p> 

 "There is still a lot of animation that fails to stop moving after three

 seconds," she said. "This can be a distraction for people with reading

 problems or people with low vision. There are still no text alternatives

 for multimedia which means many people, including mobile users, will

 be locked out of content. New windows also seem to open from within

 Flash movies, which is not only an accessibility but also a usability

 issue."

</p>
<p> 

 These issues could have a wider impact than the restriction of access

 for people with disabilities, Swan said. "Many of the issues that

 adversely affect people with disabilities also affect many other users

 such as mobile users, users on dial up or older browsers. Had

 accessibility advice been followed the site would have opened up to

 significantly more people."

</p>
<p> 

 There are signs that the Beijing organising committee, BOCOG, may

 have concluded that web accessibility would not be as much of an

 issue for the Olympic Games as for the Paralympics, which are set to

 take place from 6 to 17 September. Though neither site has an

 accessibility statement, unlike the website for the Olympics the website

 for the Paralympics does claim in press releases to have been designed

 according to international accessibility guidelines, and the site is

 visibly more simply designed (

 <a href="http://en.paralympic.beijing2008.cn/">http://en.paralympic.beijing2008.cn/</a>
 ).
</p>
<p> 

 In July a press release on the Paralympics site

 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/para1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/para1</a>
) announced that China's Ministry of
 Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Science and

 Technology had launched some 'improvements' to both the official

 BOCOG site (<a href="http://en.olympic.cn/">http://en.olympic.cn/</a>
) and the website of the Chinese
 Disabled Persons Federation (<a href="http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/">http://www.cdpf.org.cn/english/</a>
).
</p>
<p> 

 According to the press release - these modifications include automatic

 text resizing; an automatic sign language system for deaf users; and a

 free 'speech broadcasting' system in English and Chinese.

</p>
<p> 

 Attempts to find out more about the 'speech broadcasting' features

 meet with confused and patchy results, however. There is no sign of

 this system on the front page of the Beijing2008 site or indeed any of

 the other official English language Olympics sites, including the

 BOCOG site mentioned in the press release, nor does it materialise in

 any site search of the Olympic pages.

</p>
<p> 

 The Chinese Disabled Persons Federation, which was mentioned in the

 same release, does have a 'voice' link at the top of its page which takes

 to the user to stripped down version of the site and reads out text using

 the mouse pointer. However this body has no obvious connection with

 the Olympics and it is unclear why it was mentioned at all.

</p>
<p> 

 There is a link to a different 'Easy Web Browsing' (EWB) system

 through a banner advertisement on the Paralympics website

 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/beijing2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/beijing2</a>
). This section tells users that the
 system is designed to help the illiterate, visually impaired, elderly,

 those with learning difficulties and those not used to computers. The

 system can speak in several languages including Chinese, Japanese,

 French, English, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian and is able

 to detect the language of the page automatically.

</p>
<p> 

 However the EWB does not quite live up to its name. To use the

 system, the user must download a programme which only works with

 Microsoft Internet Explorer.

</p>
<p> 

 To operate it the user must move his or her mouse pointer over a

 paragraph of text which is then magnified and read aloud. However,

 the program stops reading at the end of each paragraph and to continue

 to the next paragraph the user must reposition the mouse. Such a

 system could not benefit somebody unable to effectively operate a

 mouse, including blind people and those with poor motor control.

</p>
<p> 

 Overall, Swan said it seems likely that BOCOG did not produce a clear

 accessibility plan for the website. "It is disappointing that lessons from

 the legal case against the Sydney Olympic website have not been

 learned."
