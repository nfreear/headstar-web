<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i102-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessibility Deadlines Set For Uk Government Websites.</h3>
<p> 
 All new UK public sector websites must conform to at least 'AA' 
 accessibility standards as specified by the W3C Web Content 
 Accessibility Guidelines, according to guidance published this month 
 by the Cabinet Office.
</p>
<p> 
 Existing central government department websites must conform to 
 'AA' by December 2009 and all other government agencies and non-
 departmental bodies by March 2011, according to the guidance, 
 'Delivering inclusive websites' (
 <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=129">http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=129</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The guidance allows public bodies a little more breathing space than 
 was proposed in a draft published last autumn (see 
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=55">http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=55</a>
). This had called for  compliance for all sites by December 2008.
</p>
<p> 
 The final guidance - which is not mandated by law - also tones down 
 the severity of its warning of repercussions for non-compliant bodies, 
 compared with last year's draft.
</p>
<p> 
 The draft had threatened to switch off non-compliant websites 
 altogether, warning: "websites which fail to meet the mandated level of 
 conformance shall be subject to the withdrawal process for .gov.uk 
 domain names". The final guidance issues a similar warning, but using 
 the softer formula 'may be at risk' instead of 'shall be subject to': 
 "Government website owners are reminded to follow the conditions of 
 use for a .gov.uk name (Registering .gov.uk domain names (TG114)). 
 Websites which fail to meet the .gov.uk accessibility requirements may 
 be at risk of having their domain name withdrawn".
</p>
<p> 
 The conditions of use for .gov.uk domains referenced here, document 
 TG114, do not spell out in clear terms what precise actions government 
 websites need to take to be accessible. Instead they state in general 
 terms: "Applications (web, email, etc) using a .gov.uk domain name 
 must comply with current UK legislation and support channels that 
 provide accessibility for disabled people.Abuse of [sic] will result in 
 the name being withdrawn" (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/caboff1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/caboff1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Other areas covered by the new guidance includes a requirement for 
 bodies to produce website accessibility policies; and advice on 
 assessment of accessibility through the use of user testing and other 
 methods.
</p>
<h3 id="i102-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Major Employers Launch Accessibility Taskforce.</h3>
<p> 
 A taskforce to help businesses provide accessible technology to 
 employees and customers has been launched by the UK's Employers' 
 Forum on Disability (EFD -
 <a href="http://www.efd.org.uk">http://www.efd.org.uk</a>
), a body whose members include some of the country's largest 
 corporations and public agencies.
</p>
<p> 
 The aim of the forum's Business Taskforce on Accessible Technology 
 is to "make accessibility and usability as fundamental to IT as security
</p>
<p> 
 is now," said Steve Lamey, Chief Operating Officer of HM Revenue & 
 Customs and chair of the new group.
</p>
<p> 
 Some parts of the business community are still failing to see the 
 benefits of improving accessibility, the forum says. Accordingly, one 
 of the most important jobs of the new taskforce will be to promote 
 awareness of the strong business case for engaging with disabled 
 people as both colleagues and customers.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility adjustment can be simple and inexpensive, such as 
 making better use of accessibility options in MS Office, and can lead to
</p>
<p> 
 major benefits, the forum says. For example, accessible recruitment 
 would open the door to another 1.3 million potential employees in the 
 UK, it says. And accessible websites can be up to 75 per cent smaller, 
 making them quicker to load and reducing infrastructure demand. 
 Legal and General's new accessible website increased online sales by 
 90,000 pounds and reduced costs by over 200,000 per annum, the 
 forum says.
</p>
<p> 
 Taskforce members include representatives of leading global brands 
 such as Goldman Sachs and Sainsbury's. It will help members share 
 tips and advice; encourage suppliers to deliver more accessible 
 products; and try to improve training in the provision of accessible IT 
 solutions.
</p>
<p>

 Disability see 'Organisation in the Spotlight', Section Four, this

</p>
<h3 id="i102-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Charity Embraces Social Networks And Second Life.</h3>
<p> 
 A leading charity is using a wide range of social networking and 
 multimedia sites - Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, YouTube and iTunes  - 
 to provide support and information to parents of disabled children and 
 help them contact each other.
</p>
<p> 
 Contact a Family (<a href="http://www.cafamily.org.uk/">http://www.cafamily.org.uk/</a>
), which runs a parent  networking website called Making Contact 
 (<a href="http://www.makingcontact.org/">http://www.makingcontact.org/</a>
), says parents of disabled children  often feel isolated because they don't know anybody in the same 
 situation. But mothers, who are often the primary carers for children 
 with disabilities, are now among the biggest users of social networking 
 sites, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 Srabani Sen, Chief Executive of Contact a Family says: "Mums 
 exhausted by night after night of broken sleep and restricted from 
 leaving the house because of their intensive caring roles are turning to
</p>
<p> 
 social networking sites for emotional support and information about 
 their child's condition."
</p>
<p> 
 The charity has also set up a 'virtual library' in the online world 
 Second Life, which has welcomed around 100 visitors since its launch 
 in May. The virtual library is manned every Wednesday from 10am - 
 4pm when 'Advisor Somerflek', the charity's avatar or virtual persona, 
 is on hand to talk to visitors courtesy of a real-world parent adviser. 
 For those in the know, the office is located at the co-ordinates Aloft 
 Island 19.40.22 .
</p>
<p> 
 The charity is by no means the first to set up in Second Life and the 
 virtual world's owners, Linden Labs, offer special discounts to non-
 profit bodies (<a href="http://secondlifegrid.net/programs/nonprofit">http://secondlifegrid.net/programs/nonprofit</a>
). A notable  example is Save the Children who collected money to provide animals 
 for Tibetan peasants by selling virtual Yaks.

</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Blue Chip Accessby Dan Jellinek And James Scott.
</h3>
<p> 
 The creation of the Employers' Forum on Disability (EFD) Business 
 Taskforce on Accessible Technology (see News, this issue) is a sign 
 that the UK's and the world's largest companies and organisations are 
 beginning to take accessibility seriously.
</p>
<p> 
 The taskforce aims to help global ICT suppliers and regulators 
 understand what organisations need from IT products and standards if 
 they are to employ and do business with disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 So what kind of body is the EFD?
</p>
<p> 
 The forum claims to be the largest and most active organisation of its 
 kind in the world. It has campaigned since 1991 for more accessible 
 and inclusive workplaces, collaborating with disabled people, 
 government and businesses to help make it easier for firms to employ 
 disabled people and serve disabled customers.
</p>
<p> 
 It has published numerous guidelines advising its members on how to 
 improve provisions for the disabled, on topics such as employment, 
 customer care, IT, e-commerce, e-recruitment, the built environment, 
 product development, corporate responsibility, procurement, health and 
 safety, occupational health, marketing and communications.
</p>
<p> 
 Among its highest profile projects is the Disability Standard, which the
</p>
<p> 
 EFD claims is the only management tool available that allows 
 organisations to accurately measure their performance on disability, 
 including access to IT. In 2007, some 116 UK and global private and 
 public sector employers used the standard.
</p>
<p> 
 The forum also sponsors the Great Place to Work Institute's Disability 
 Excellence Award, which has been won three times in a row by the 
 investment bank Lehman Brothers. The bank's exemplary measures 
 include some innovation with technology such as an intranet sites for 
 disabled employees and a scheme whereby hearing-impaired 
 employees are given a Blackberry portable email device to carry at 
 work, which is activated via pre-set alert information in case of 
 emergency evacuation from a lift or building.
</p>
<p> 
 The EFD says it has been promoting the benefits of accessible IT in 
 several ways for many years prior to the establishment of its new 
 taskforce, including the publication of a practical guide to accessible 
 web design and the delivery of accessibility training events. Despite 
 these services, however, the body acknowledges that poor practice 
 does continue among UK businesses.
</p>
<p> 
 "Poor practice relating to access to technology has been well 
 publicised, such as the 2004 Disability Rights Commission report on 
 Access and Inclusion for Disabled People," EFD spokesperson Liz 
 Nightingale told E-Access Bulletin. "Since this report was published a 
 number of organisations including EFD members like Legal and 
 General and Lloyds TSB, have been working hard to demonstrate best 
 practice around accessible IT."
</p>
<p> 
 Despite the progress, the forum knows there is still plenty of work to 
 be done if it is to achieve its ultimate stated goal of completely 
 outlawing discrimination in the workplace. Nevertheless, its founder 
 and chief executive Susan Scott-Parker is determined that this 
 objective will be achieved.
</p>
<p> 
 Scott-Parker, a Canadian who has lived in Britain for 25 years, 
 established the forum in 1991. Since then it has grown rapidly to its 
 current size of 400 members including 120 global companies, which 
 between them employ eight million people, or some 20 per cent of the 
 UK's workforce. Members include Barclays, whose group CEO John 
 Varley is current EFD president; and Royal Mail Group, whose CEO 
 Adam Crozier is chair. And the forum's prestigious 'President's group' 
 read like a who's who of British business, from Tesco CEO Sir Terry 
 Leahy to BT's chief Ben Verwaayen. The purpose of such a senior 
 grouping is to signal to colleagues, customers, and government that 
 disability is a strategic business and societal priority, the forum
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 Scott-Parker has also been involved in many international projects in 
 the disability arena including helping the International Labour 
 Organisation ILO establish the Sri Lankan employers' network on 
 disability and pioneering the world's first leadership program for 
 people with disabilities, in partnership with consultants The Coverdale 
 Organisation. In 2000 she was honoured with an OBE.
</p>
<p> 
 It is a sign of how seriously the forum now takes accessibility
 therefore 
 that Scott-Parker has stepped forward to chair the new taskforce 
 herself.
</p>
<p> 
 "The taskforce is a continuation of our work around accessible IT and 
 our long-term goal is to develop guidance to help our members 
 confidently measure and improve the accessibility of internal systems 
 and external services," says Liz Nightingale. "We are also pleased to 
 be represented on IST/45, the British Standards Institution committee 
 responsible for creating BS8878, the first British standard on web 
 accessibility. This is due to be published in the first quarter of 2009.
</p>
<p> 
 "One of the biggest objectives for the taskforce this year is to engage 
 with key players in the IT industry and we are delighted that 
 representatives from some of these organisations are meeting with 
 taskforce members in the middle of June to informally discuss the 
 business case for disability. We see this as the beginning of a very 
 exciting and meaningful collaboration which will result in barrier free 
 IT for all employees".
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the goal of all the forum's work could be summed up by a 
 phrase which appears in its citation to the three-time winner of its 
 disability excellence awards, Lehman Brothers - 'disability 
 confidence'.
</p>
<p> 
 "We are looking for an approach to disability that is above and beyond 
 legal compliance," says Rhiannon Suter, research and innovations 
 manager at EFD. "We are looking for 'disability confidence,' meaning 
 that the company understands the benefits and has the flexibility to 
 remove barriers for groups of disabled people, but also make 
 adjustments that enable individuals to contribute."
</p>
<p> 
 If the new taskforce can achieve this for the use of technology in the 
 workplace and its development for the consumer, all its goals will have 
 been achieved.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Opinion- Web Accessibility.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Life In The Post-Guideline Age.By Julie Howell.
</h3>
<p> 
 Joe Clark, the Canadian web accessibility expert, has said that he 
 believes we now live in a post-guideline era.
</p>
<p> 
 What might Joe mean by this?
</p>
<p> 
 To date, talk about making websites usable by disabled people has 
 usually featured the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Web 
 Accessibility Guidelines as a key aspect. This is absolutely appropriate
</p>
<p> 
 and remains the crucial foundation of every website.
</p>
<p> 
 However research, such as that undertaken by the Disability Rights 
 Commission in 2004, has suggested that even those organisations that 
 believe they have applied accessibility guidelines when designing their 
 sites are not always producing websites that disabled people can use 
 with sufficient degrees of success.
</p>
<p> 
 This would seem to point to a gap in understanding between web 
 developers and the guidelines. It may be that developers fully 
 understand the technical aspects of the guidelines but are failing to 
 address disabled people's user experiences. An accessible website that 
 is unusable is of little help to disabled people, so in order to create
 web 
 experiences that are meaningful for disabled people perhaps it's time 
 we began to think beyond technical guidelines and put stronger focus 
 on usability for disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 It is crucial to understand that thinking around web usability for 
 disabled people is maturing year by year. Technology improves and 
 our understanding of how disabled people use the web improves.
</p>
<p> 
 In the past, accessibility advocates have promoted the 'design for all' 
 and 'one size fits all' approaches to web design, where a single version
</p>
<p> 
 of the site is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of
 ability 
 or disability. However, personalisation is now a very common web 
 design practice where everyone who visits a site (be they disabled or 
 not) is served a version of the content and design that is optimised 
 according to their individual needs and preferences.
</p>
<p> 
 In the 'real' world we are naturally opposed to alternative entrances to
</p>
<p> 
 buildings or different levels of service provision for disabled people,
 as 
 'alternative' and 'different' in this context often means 'segregated'
 and 
 'poorer quality'. However, online personalisation really means 'better 
 quality' with web experiences optimised to better suit every individual.
</p>
<p> 
 This does not mean text-only versions of sites for disabled people. But 
 it can mean optimised content that is easier and quicker to navigate if 
 you are using a screenreader (for example).
</p>
<p> 
 I cite as an example Tesco.com. Tesco has - after extensive user testing
</p>
<p> 
 with screenreader users - created an optimised version of its e-grocery 
 service to give screenreader users a better quality, faster shopping 
 experience with access to its full product range. Some screenreader 
 users feel this is unacceptable, believing one version of the site
 should 
 cater for everyone's needs, while others are happier to use a site that
 is 
 optimised for screenreader use.
</p>
<p> 
 A few years ago I would have agreed that creating an 'alternative' 
 version of a website is not acceptable. But today, with everyone 
 receiving an online experience that is virtually tailored for them 
 individually, the optimised approach seems to offer greater benefits. 
 The UK's Disability Discrimination Act requires equality of service 
 provision. Does this mean blind people should use the same version of 
 a website even if it greatly slows them down, or is an optimised 
 version that allows a faster, better quality user experience preferable,
</p>
<p> 
 so long as the standard of service is equal to that received by people 
 who are not disabled? If you think in terms of excellent user 
 experiences for disabled people, optimisation and personalisation 
 would seem to have more to offer.
</p>
<p> 
 We need to keep our eyes on web trends and recognise trends that 
 actually help to improve disabled people's experience of the web. 
 Arguably, personalisation is a trend that actually helps as its focus is
 on 
 sites' best possible performance for every user and is a great deal more
</p>
<p> 
 effective that the 'one site for all' approach.
</p>
<p> 
 Guidance is changing. Watch out for version 2.0 of WCAG, which 
 should be published in 2009, and the new British Standard for web 
 accessibility (BS8878) that should appear next April. There is a shift
 of 
 emphasis towards including user testing by disabled people that 
 encourages web developers to be mindful of disabled people's online 
 experiences.
</p>
<p> 
 The new approach will also appeal to businesses and this is also very 
 good news for disabled web users. The aim of any website is to convert 
 its visitors into customers. Businesses are now investing a good deal 
 more time and money into optimising 'user journeys' to ensure that the 
 people using their sites find the route to making a purchase (or finding
</p>
<p> 
 the information they are looking for) as quick, easy and enjoyable as 
 possible.
</p>
<p> 
 I think of this as a pyramid. Web accessibility is the foundation. 
 Usability by disabled people is the next layer. And both of these 
 underpin the ultimate goal: excellent user experiences by disabled 
 people (and everyone).
</p>
<p> 
 If we really want equality on the web, it strikes me that we must adopt 
 the language that businesses are using when they talk about creating 
 websites that maximise profit. Right now, businesses are really 
 interested in how the web can quickly deliver return on investment 
 through increased sales. They are looking to web usability techniques 
 to achieve the creation of excellent user experiences for everyone 
 because they know this leads to increased sales. We need to make sure 
 that businesses understand that disabled people have a right to 
 excellent user experiences too and to view disabled people as simply 
 another target audience. If we can do this, our goal of online inclusion
</p>
<p> 
 and equality really could become reality.
