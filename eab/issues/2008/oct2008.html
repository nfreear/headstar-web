<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Final Countdown To Long-Awaited Web Access Guidelines.</h3>
<p> 
 A long-awaited updated version of the main international standard for
 making websites accessible to people with disabilities is expected to be
 published in December, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0 from
 the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C - <a href="http://www.w3c.org">http://www.w3c.org</a>
) have been in development for several years.
</p>
<p> 
 The first version of the WCAG guidelines now dates back around a
 decade, and though it has proved a vital tool for raising awareness of
 accessibility issues it has long been seen as over-technical, complex
 and unclear in many situations.
</p>
<p> 
 Version 2.0 is set to address many of these problems by moving away
 from rigid technical 'checkpoints' to more flexible 'success criteria.'
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this month week, the responsible World Wide Web consortium
 working group met in Boston, US to finalise the current 'Candidate
 recommendation' phase of WCAG 2.0 in which the new guidelines
 have been tested on real web sites to confirm their applicability.
</p>
<p> 
 The group will debate which success criteria can be considered
 sufficiently stable to be implemented, and some of the requirements
 previously marked as 'At risk' will be reviewed to ensure the guidelines
 can be met in practice. A W3C spokesman told E-Government Bulletin
 this week that publication in December was now expected, and that if
 the deadline did slip any further it would be a matter of weeks, not
 months.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="i106-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Recession Is Poor Excuse For Exclusion, Analyst Warns.</h3>
<p> 
 Organisations should not use the economic downturn as a reason not to
 carry out work to make their websites more accessible to people with
 disabilities, a leading analyst said this week.
</p>
<p> 
 In fact there is extensive evidence that an economic downturn is a good
 time to increase such activity, with significant opportunities to increase
 market share, Ted Page of PWS web services told the Law Society of
 Scotland's 'Nothing But The Net' conference
 (<a href="http://www.lawscot.org.uk/update/NBTN/">http://www.lawscot.org.uk/update/NBTN/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 "A study published by McKinsey in 2002 found one of the most
 significant differences between the most and least profitable firms over
 the economic cycle was with respect to their spending on marketing
 and advertising during the recession period," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Far from battening down the hatches when the economy turned down,
 the best performers actually increased spending in these areas, not just
 relative to their competitors but also compared to their own spending in
 better economic times. There have been many similar studies that have
 come to broadly the same conclusions."
</p>
<p> 
 A recent survey by PWS found more than 80 per cent of professional
 services firms are failing to comply with the Disability Discrimination
 Act with respect to their websites, despite the costs of fixing
 accessibility problems generally being moderate or low, Page said.
</p>
<p> 
 Fixing problems would enable companies to better reach 10 million
 disabled people in the UK, with &#194;�80 billion annual spending power, he
 said. It also offers better access to people using mobile web devices
 which are not designed to cope with inaccessible websites; and could
 improve access to the &#194;�160 billion a year public sector procurement
 market which encourages and may soon be made dependent on
 accessibility of goods and services purchased.
</p>
<p> 
 There is one final reason why accessibility should not be ignored, Page
 said - Google. "It is in no way controversial to state that an accessible
 website is almost always a Google-friendly one. When Google comes
 to index your web content it navigates in much the same way that a
 blind person using screen reader does. It is for good reason that Google
 is often referred to as the "big blind billionaire". Shut it out at your
 peril."

<h3 id="i106-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: People With Impaired Vision 'Less Likely To Be Employed'.</h3>
<p> 
 People with visual impairments are less likely to be employed than
 people with other disabilities, according to a report on the UK labour
 market experiences of people with sight problems prepared for the
 RNIB by the Institute of Employment Studies (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ies1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ies1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The report was compiled through secondary analysis of the UK Labour
 Force Survey (LFS -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/lfs1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/lfs1</a>
 ) over the period July 2004 to June 2007. The LFS recorded 184,000
 people of working age in the UK who describe themselves as having
 'seeing difficulties'. Of those 108,000 are classed as disabled, 95,000
 of whom have a 'work-limiting' disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB report finds people over 55 are three times more likely to
 have seeing difficulties as those in the 16-24 age bracket, which is a
 greater increase with age than with other kinds of disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition, the report finds that people who are disabled with seeing
 difficulties are less likely to be employed (48 per cent) than those with
 other kinds of disability (50 per cent); this compares to an overall
 employment rate of 75 per cent among people of working age. For
 people with more than one disability, the employment rate drops to 38
 per cent, however for people with 'seeing difficulties' that do not
 constitute a disability the rate is much higher at 83 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 The unemployment rates are 8 per cent for disabled people as a whole
 but 13 per cent for those disabled by visual impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 In contrast, the report also found that a higher than average proportion
 of visually impaired disabled people are employed in high-level
 positions.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Global Standards Giant Gears Up For Battleby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 With the long-awaited appearance of version 2 of the World Wide Web
 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) now
 expected in December, the spotlight is set to fall once more on the
 workings of this key international standards body.
</p>
<p> 
 The consortium, known as W3C, was founded in 1994 by the inventor
 of the web Tim Berners-Lee, who remains its director. It functions as a
 developer and repository of key technical standards and protocols that
 are needed to be shared by technology companies and users to ensure
 that the web remains open and universal.
</p>
<p> 
 With a current membership of more than 400 organisations, from large
 multinational technology companies to universities and charities, W3C
 has three main global bases: the European Research Consortium for
 Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) at the Sophia Antipolis
 technology park in the South of France; Massachusetts Institute of
 Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Technology
 Laboratory; and Keio University in Japan.
</p>
<p> 
 The consortium has a core staff of around 70, with around 30 in
 Europe, 30 in the US and 10 Japan. But the actual headcount of those
 involved in its work is more than 500 if a tally is taken of everyone in
 the consortium's working groups, interest groups, and the wider
 community.
</p>
<p> 
 The WCAG work falls under the auspices of W3C's Web Accessibility
 Initiative (WAI), a programme that cuts across all the consortium's
 other areas. In a UK visit last month, two WAI staff Shadi Abou-Zahra
 and Andrew Arch met E-Access Bulletin in London to explain their
 work programme.
</p>
<p> 
 "WAI is one of the consortium's main work areas, and cuts across all
 the W3C's global locations," said Abou-Zahra. "One of our tasks is to
 cross-check all W3C's work such as that on [the web's core protocol]
 HTML to check it supports accessibility, because if standards like
 HTML don't support accessibility, you won't have accessible websites.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is really one of the most important pieces of work we are doing,
 though it is the least visible to the outside world. What's most well-
 known about WAI's work is its development of three guidelines -
 WCAG, ATAG (Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines) and UAAG
 (User Agent Accessibility Guidelines).
</p>
<p> 
 Authoring tools guidelines relate to content management systems, and
 are aimed at ensuring these systems need to create accessible content,
 while user agents are tools like browsers and media players, Abou-
 Zahra says.
</p>
<p> 
 "Other areas of our work include education and outreach, which is
 really important, because most people who make inaccessible websites
 are  often unaware of the issues for people with disabilities."
</p>
<p> 
 One major new piece of work undertaken by WAI is the EC-funded
 WAI-AGE Project (
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/</a>
 ), a look at the implications of an ageing population for web access,
 given the older people are more likely to have disabilities and may also
 be less familiar with new technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 "Demographics worldwide are dramatically changing at the moment,"
 says Andrew Arch, who works with Abou-Zahra on WAI-AGE. "The
 proportions of older to younger people are changing as well as the
 numbers. We're living longer, and we haven't got the support behind
 us.
</p>
<p> 
 "Lots of things have got to change in governments and organisations -
 with an ageing workforce, you have to keep learning to stay
 accessible."
</p>
<p> 
 The WAI-AGE project is partly aimed at finding out whether there are
 any significant new pieces of work needed to ensure web accessibility
 for an older population, Arch says.
</p>
<p> 
 "We've looked at what research and user observation has gone on over
 the decade. There is a pretty big overlap between older people and
 others with disabilities - sight starts to decline, motor dexterity - and
 individually these overlap. But with older people there is often a lack
 of recognition that there is a disability there. For example some people
 might just say they can't remember so well, rather than that they have a
 cognitive impairment. Or people won't see failing eye-sight as a
 disability, it's just 'part of growing old'. But they are disabilities, and
 often multiple disabilities."
</p>
<p> 
 Having gained a grasp of current research the project returned to
 guidelines such as WCAG 2.0 to see if any changes might be needed.
 "A large proportion of the needs of older people are met by the new
 guidelines, but other things might need to feed into the guidance we
 will issue on implementing the guidelines, for example guidance on
 how people prepare content for older people.," said Arch.
</p>
<p> 
 "Many older people have not grown up with computers, and may not
 realise their capabilities, for example that you can magnify text in your
 browser."
</p>
<p> 
 However as well as helping to address the problems of ageing it is also
 important to challenge myths and assumptions about older people such
 as none of them have any interest or expertise in using computers, says
 Abou-Zahra. "Social networking is an important part of ageing, for
 example. And making social networking sites more accessible for older
 users benefits everybody."
</p>
<p> 
 This argument is a development of the age-old mantra from the
 accessibility sector that people with disabilities want to use the web in
 the same way as everybody else - "it is a human right recognised by
 the UN," says Abou-Zahra. But he recognizes that businesses in
 particular will also  be interested in the additional business benefits,
 especially in the current financial climate.
</p>
<p> 
 "With commercial organisations the return on investment is often an
 important argument. Well, a few years ago, companies might have said
 'how many older people are online?' but with demographics changing
 they know the answer. And with the current surge in mobile phone use
 there is another incentive, since accessible sites work better on mobile
 phones."
</p>
<p> 
 Other financial factors include helping to hold onto employees as their
 average age rises through making internal web systems more
 accessible, though more work is needed on in all these areas, he says.
 "We know there are not enough numbers attached to these business
 cases, and we hope for more soon. There is a business case document
 for accessibility on the WAI website, and we are updating it to reflect
 new developments."
</p>
<p> 
 For many, however, the key accessibility event of the year - assuming
 it does scrape into 2008 - will be the release of WCAG 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 The WCAG working group held a face-to-face meeting in Boston at
 the beginning of October to examine the results of trial implementation
 of the draft guidelines on real websites, and now expects to finalise
 WCAG 2.0 as a fully-fledged W3C recommendation by December or
 at the latest by early next year, Abou-Zahra says.
</p>
<p> 
 The first version of the WCAG guidelines now dates back around a
 decade, and though it has proved a vital tool for raising awareness of
 accessibility issues it has long been seen as over-technical and complex
 and unclear in many situations.
</p>
<p> 
 Version 2.0 is set to address many of these problems by moving away
 from rigid technical 'checkpoints' to more flexible 'success criteria.'
</p>
<p> 
 Another change of style will be a greater separation between the core
 guidelines and references to specific technologies such as Javascript or
 browser types, Abou-Zahra says.
</p>
<p> 
 "The work needs to be coupled to technologies, but how do we do that
 in such a way as to not make it outdated the moment it is released?
 This is the complex issue," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 "WCAG 1.0 was too  technology-specific. Back then HTML was more
 dominant, and there was less use of multimedia, but today we have a
 flurry of technologies such as Ajax, so the first lesson we learned is
 don't write for a specific technology. Also, in the days of WCAG 1.0
 we had to exclude Javascript because it was not sufficiently
 standardised and  assistive technology could not handle it consistently,
 but now that has largely changed so you need to include it, to look at
 how any technology should be accessible. The requirements - such as
 tagging images with text - needs to apply to any technology you are
 using.
</p>
<p> 
 "So WCAG is more decoupled - but having said that, no matter how
 much you decouple it from specific technologies, there still need to be
 points of contact with real technologies, places where the tyre hits the
 road. It is an issue the group is looking to resolve by updating
 implementation guidance."
</p>
<p> 
 Another ongoing problem with the WAI web content guidelines is that
 they do not fully address the needs of people with cognitive
 disabilities, admits Abou-Zahra, though he says this is a challenging
 longer term issue that the organisation is working to resolve alongside
 the wider access community.
</p>
<p> 
 "We know it does not fully meet the needs of people with cognitive
 disabilities such as  some forms of learning  disabilities, we admit this
 up-front," he says. "It is a longer term project, maybe one for WCAG
 3.0. I feel this is an issue that the accessibility community as a whole
 needs to address, more research is needed."
</p>
<p> 
 Beyond the publication of WCAG 2.0, W3C and WAI will continue to
 prioritise accessibility across all its areas of work, he says. "WAI's
 work is often reduced to WCAG in the public eye, but it is a whole lot
 more than content, it is about making the web accessible in its broadest
 sense."
