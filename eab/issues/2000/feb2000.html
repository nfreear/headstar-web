<strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>ONLINE COPYRIGHT ROW EDGES TOWARDS</strong><br />
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>The long-standing problem of copyright infringements in the
transcription of internet and other online information into braille
or other accessible formats moved closer to a solution this week,
following a meeting between rights holder groups and transcription
agencies in the UK.</p>
<p>Rights holders, led by the Publishers Licensing Society (PLS),
are now working on a form of licensing which would allow the RNIB
and other named braille producers to capture copyright material in
electronic formats with the purpose of transcribing it into braille
or other accessible formats.</p>
<p>However the move could merely be an interim solution, with the
RNIB and others continuing to push in the longer term for
legislation for an absolute right of transcription. The
transcribers object to a licensing scheme on two grounds: first, on
principle, in that transcription should be a basic right for all
visually impaired people; and second, on practical grounds, because
a licensing system is difficult to manage and police.</p>
<p>The transcription problem arises because some electronic data,
available on the internet or via other media, needs to be captured
and altered prior to transcription into braille or other formats
which are accessible to blind and visually impaired people.
However, even where information is available to be read for free
online, capture and manipulation will often infringe copyright
because it will involve copying, storing and often transmitting the
information between agencies, which is not usually allowed.</p>
<p>The copyright holders are happy to licence trusted bodies like
the RNIB to use the data lawfully, but fear that wider
transcription rights could lead to copyright material being freely
emailed around the world between people who are not visually
impaired.</p>
<p>David Mann, Campaigns Officer at the RNIB, said another
potential problem could be caused in future by new electronic text
formats which used encryption techniques to prevent copying, and
thus block transcription. He said the only long-term solution was a
general right of transcription for those in genuine need.</p>
<p>"Blind people are not expecting something for nothing, just the
same rights as anyone else. If everyone has to pay a charge for
certain online information, blind and visually impaired people have
no problem with paying the same charge: it is only if information
is free to read online, that blind and visually impaired people
object to being prevented from accessing it as well".</p>
<p>Under the new licensing scheme, which is subject to a final
proposal to be put forward by the PLS in the next few weeks, Mann
said licensed transcribers would notify the PLS whenever they
captured data for conversion, and in turn the PLS would indemnify
them against breach of copyright. He acknowledged that it was a
step forward for transcribers, as currently they had to track down
individual rights holders to obtain permission.</p>
<p><strong>SAMSUNG DEVELOPS DIGITAL GUIDE DOG</strong><br />
<strong>HARNESS</strong></p>
<p>The Korean electronics giant Samsung has developed a prototype
digital guide dog harness which combines the use of the GPS global
satellite positioning system with the ability to record vocal
notes.</p>
<p>The harness works in tandem with a wrist-mounted device, and
together the system will help guide dog owners achieve even greater
independence and track new routes, according to a report in this
week's Electronics Weekly magazine (web site<br />
<a href=
"http://www.electronicsweekly.co.uk/">www.electronicsweekly.co.uk</a>
- although the story only appears in the printed version, cover
date 16 Feb).</p>
<p>Since 1992 Samsung has funded Korea's only guide dog school.

<p><strong>HI-TECH RETINAL DISPLAYS COULD ASSIST</strong><br />
<strong>VISUALLY IMPAIRED</strong></p>
<p>Miniaturised laser displays which beam information and images
directly onto a retina from a tiny device mounted in the frame of a
pair of glasses could be used to overcome visual impairment in some
cases, according to technology design expert Kevin Carey.</p>
<p>The Virtual Retinal Display, currently in development by US firm
Microvision, uses a rapidly scanned beam of light to project images
on the eye's retina, allowing the viewer to see large, full-motion
images without the need for a conventional display screen. In
conjunction with a chip technology called microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS), the entire technology can be constructed in
miniature.</p>
<p>Carey says that the technology could help people with
imperfections in their eyes by focusing on parts which had greatest
functionality. For example, people with an imperfect cornea but
functioning retinas may be able to see the laser signals perfectly.
The technology and others like it could prove of "immense
importance" in helping the visually impaired gain access to the
information age, Carey said.</p>
<p>Microvision has already pioneered various health applications of
its retinal technology. An ongoing study at the University of
California San Diego is detecting retinal diseases and vision
disorders using a portable scanning display which scans a stimulus
onto the patient's retina. Patients without retinal damage saw
moving particles throughout their field of vision, while patients
with areas of retinal damage are able to see their own blind areas,
and map them using a pen-based computer program.</p>
<p>Last month a further futuristic application was announced to be
tested later this year: the live projection of medical scans
directly onto a surgeon's eyes to improve hand-eye co-ordination
during micro-surgery.</p>

<p><strong>WEB GATEWAY EXPANDS INTO EUROPE</strong></p>
<p>The International Center for Disability Resources on the
Internet, a US-based body, is looking to expand its collection of
links to European web resources relating to disability. Relevant
organisations and individuals can register their web sites at:
<a href="http://www.icdri.org/">www.icdri.org</a></p>
<p><strong>ILIAD - AN OFFLINE ODYSSEY</strong></p>
<p>Another useful US site to know about is ILIAD, a simple and
powerful tool that allows you to search the internet offline using
email.</p>
<p>ILIAD was created by the educational arm of NASA as an
intelligent search agent to help teachers and students who may have
limited access to the web to conduct searches by sending email.
Search results are then sent back by email and collected at their
convenience. The system has become hugely popular with visually
impaired and blind people because it bypasses the visual web
browser interface.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE TO OUR OVERSEAS READERS -</strong><br />
<strong>ONLINE DEBATE</strong></p>
<p>All readers of this bulletin from outside the UK are invited to
put themselves forward to take part in a global 'virtual think
tank' to debate development of the digital economy, to be run in
April on the internet by the bulletin's publisher Headstar. Access
issues will be a central theme. Please email Dan Jellinek on
<a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> with a brief
biography.</p>
<p>Apologies to UK readers - we are already oversubscribed for the
UK, but there will be an opportunity for anyone to contribute to
the debate when it goes live in the web site's public area - full
details in our March issue.</p>
<p><strong>READER COMMENT - RADIO ON TV</strong></p>
<p>A reader writes: Dear E-Access Bulletin: Following on from the
article on Digital Audio Broadcasting (section two, EAB January
2000), which expressed concerns for blind and visually impaired
people about adding a visual data stream to a radio signal, I note
that on satellite, you can already receive radio stations with data
displayed on your TV screen, and there are a number of radio
stations broadcasting music without DJs.</p>
<p>Because information about the records can be displayed visually
on the TV screen, all you hear are records played consecutively. So
if a blind or visually impaired person wants to know what a
particular track was because they might like to buy it, they
currently have to ask a sighted person what is on the screen.</p>
<p>This works no differently from the format of, say, the ITV Chart
show, and I feel therefore that this practice lends weight to the
argument that radio with a visual content is simply television. The
purity of the medium is already being sacrificed in the interests
of economy: you don't have to pay DJs to present the programmes. So
how can we protect it, if it is not too late already?</p>

<strong>SECTION TWO: ACCESSIBLE BANKING</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>CALIFORNIA DREAMING ABOUT</strong><br />
<strong>INDEPENDENT BANKING</strong><br />
By Kristof Burek</p>
<p>It was a trip to California that led one woman to decide last
year that enough was enough for visually impaired bank users in the
UK.</p>
<p>Monica Davie has a visually impaired father, and had observed
with increasing frustration the difficulties he routinely
encountered in accessing the UK banking system. Inspired by finding
Braille symbols on cash dispenser machines on a visit to
California, on her return she began to raise interest among blind
and partially sighted people in the UK in forming a group of
consumers to talk to the banks about making their services
accessible.</p>
<p>The fruit of this work was the Visionary Banking Project, set up
in May last year to push for independent, confidential banking for
visually impaired people.</p>
<p>The project is urging banks to realise the potential of various
technologies that research shows can benefit visually impaired
customers and others.</p>
<p>Many of the major UK banks have offered some level of provision
for their visually impaired customers for a number of years, such
as bank statements in Braille or large print, or instruction
booklets on how to operate their cash machines in a limited way.
Many also offer telephone banking services, which can be ideal for
visually impaired customers.</p>
<p>However, there is little consistency between the banks, or even
within banks. And as many building societies became banks, the
proportion of banks offering any kind of accessible services has
dwindled.</p>
<p>In October 1999, part three of the 1995 Disability
Discrimination Act came into force in the UK. This makes it
unlawful for anyone offering services directly to the public to
discriminate against people with disabilities in offering the
service, unless any such discrimination can be shown to be
"reasonable".</p>
<p>However, although the banks' reaction has generally been
positive, they have also sometimes appeared complacent. They are
still not establishing as a matter of course whether their
customers have any special needs, and nor has the consistency in
the levels of service offered by different banks improved. There
seems to be much resistance in making automated facilities such as
cash point machines and kiosk services accessible to visually
impaired customers.</p>
<p>There is no good financial reason why services should not be
made accessible for all. A substantial amount of research, much of
it EU-funded, has demonstrated there are many effective low-cost
ways to make bank services more accessible. A prototype talking
cash machine was demonstrated in 1996, and since then manufacturers
have developed other solutions based on infrared technology or the
provision of an earphone socket, which preserves the customer's
privacy - and yet the results of all this work have largely been
ignored.</p>
<p>As Ms Davie found out on her inspirational trip, in the US is
picture is more advanced. An even stronger anti-discrimination law,
the Americans with Disabilities Act, has been in force there since
July 1990, and many visually impaired Americans now take for
granted that they will be able to use a cash machine independently
because it will guide them through the facilities and services with
synthetic speech.</p>
<p>Other facilities available to visually impaired Americans
include Braille embossing on credit cards, raised lines on cheques
and even computer printed cheques. However, provision is still not
universal even in the US, even after almost 10 years with the Act
on the books.</p>
<p>The new UK Visionary Banking Project hopes to make faster
progress. As well as pushing for accessible banking systems, it is
stressing the importance of gathering reliable information about
customers' needs and the training of bank staff at all levels.
Ultimately the project intends to broaden its aims to other
financial services such as insurance and pensions.</p>
<p>The project has built up a contact list of about 50 visually
impaired people and many relevant organisations including the RNIB,
the NFB and the British Bankers' Association, and is establishing a
firm basis to be a credible consumer group to feed ideas to the
banks, influence research and measure whether the banks are
providing acceptable levels of accessible services.</p>
<p>Among its short term goals are to ensure all banks improve the
lighting near cash machines; mark all machines with clear embossed
symbols; and distribute comprehensive tactile instruction booklets
on their operation. It is also urging banks to create an easily
accessible and widely-known point of contact for all disability
issues.</p>
<p>In the longer term the project feels it is realistic to expect
widespread availability of accessible cash machines, kiosks, and
other delivery channels such as Internet and mobile phone
banking.</p>

<h2><a name="section-1.1." id="section-1.1.">SECTION THREE - ACCESS
TECHNOLOGIES</a></h2>
<p><strong>BACK TO BASICS - THE ACCESS TOOLKIT</strong><br />
by Robin Christopherson, AbilityNet</p>
<p>Some technologies enabling blind and visually impaired people to
gain access to computers and computing are relatively expensive,
like refreshable Braille displays, but there are also many
extremely useful tools which do not mean a second mortgage.</p>
<p>Below is a run-through of the most useful of these technologies,
many of them free or highly affordable.</p>
<p><strong>MOUSE POINTER ENHANCEMENT</strong><br />
As well as the changes that can be made to the appearance of the
mouse pointer arrow within Windows, there are many little utilities
that can make it any number of exotic shapes, colours and sizes, as
well as including such features as mouse trails and radar-style
aids to help find the pointer on the screen.</p>
<p>Useful free software includes the Microsoft "Intellipoint" mouse
driver from<br />
<a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/enable">www.microsoft.com/enable</a> or
visit<br />
<a href="http://www.shareware.com/">www.shareware.com</a> and
search for "mouse pointers".</p>
<p><strong>FINDING THE TEXT CURSOR</strong><br />
Many people find it difficult to locate the blinking vertical bar
that indicates where you are typing in a word processor.</p>
<p>There is no way of increasing the size, or enhancing the
appearance, of this cursor, but a free program called "follow.exe"
can be obtained that makes the mouse pointer (that can itself be
enhanced for easy visibility - see previous section) follow the
blinking cursor as it moves, enhancing its visibility.</p>
<p><strong>MAGNIFICATION SOFTWARE</strong><br />
Magnification software enlarges the image on the screen up to 20
times and tracks whatever moves to compensate for the fact that the
whole screen content is not visible at any one time. Magnification
software is quite expensive but necessary for those with
significant vision problems.</p>
<p>For Windows 3.1 there is a program called "Lunar Lite" that
offers all such functionality and is free to download from the
supplier's website at <a href=
"http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/">www.dolphinuk.co.uk</a> and then
clicking on the "Freeware" link.</p>
<p>For Windows 95/98/NT there are no such freeware programs. There
are, however, certain magnification programs with limited
functionality that are free and may help those who would like to
enlarge the occasional item that cannot be enlarged by in-built
Windows features.</p>
<p>One such program is the Magnifier in Windows 98. Another package
is the Microsoft "Intellipoint" mouse driver that is compatible
with all Microsoft mice, which includes a magnifying lens (Windows
3.X only). The lens is a small rectangle whose contents is a
magnified version of whatever is around the mouse pointer. It is
downloadable from <a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/enable.">www.microsoft.com/enable.</a></p>
<p>Screen Loupe (Windows 95/98/NT) is a similar lens program, which
can be used with any mouse - free to try, 20 US Dollars if you
decide to keep it. See: <a href=
"http://www.execpc.com/~sbd/Loupe.html">http://www.execpc.com/~sbd/Loupe.html</a></p>
<p><strong>KEYBOARD STICKERS</strong><br />
A set of large-character keyboard stickers can be purchased from
Dolphin Computer Access (01905 754577) at a cost of £15 in a range
of foreground and background colours. They are stuck onto the
existing keys to improve visibility.</p>
<p><strong>TEXT-TO-SPEECH SOFTWARE</strong><br />
There are several programs available that enable blocks of text
within a word-processor document, for example, to be read back with
synthesized speech output.</p>
<p>For example, "Reader" enables text to be read back while at the
same time highlighting words a word at a time or making them appear
one after the other in the centre of the screen, in a size and
colour of your choosing.</p>
<p><strong>SCREEN-READING SOFTWARE</strong><br />
For those who need to rely entirely on speech or Braille output to
use their computer they require a screen-reading program such as
"Hal Lite", which is available for DOS free of charge. It requires
a synthesiser called an Apollo 2, which costs £310 in its cheapest
form (an internal card) but is often available for sale second-hand
in publications such as the RNIB's "New Beacon". Hal Lite is
available for download from the freeware section at <a href=
"http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/">www.dolphinuk.co.uk</a> or you can
pay a few hundred quid for the full version with technical
support.</p>
<p>Another screen-reader is Jaws, which also requires a hardware
synthesiser such as the Apollo, and is quite pricey. It is
available for download from <a href=
"http://www.hj.com/">www.hj.com</a></p>
<p><strong>INTERNET ACCESS</strong><br />
There are several web browsers that offer speech and/or large
character output.</p>
<p>One of these is IBM's "Home Page Reader". It does not include
enlarged text but gives excellent access to even the trickiest web
page. It is available for download from <a href=
"http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/hpr">www.austin.ibm.com/sns/hpr</a>
on a trial basis and can be purchased for 149 US Dollars on-line.
It may soon be available here in the UK for purchase through normal
IBM retail outlets.</p>
<p>"PW WebSpeak" is a similar web browser that includes larger text
as well as speech output, but does not offer quite the
sophisticated functionality in dealing with very complex web pages.
It is available for download from <a href=
"http://www.soundlinks.com/">www.soundlinks.com</a> on a trial
basis and costs 78 UK Pounds for disabled individuals. It is also
available on CD-ROM from Soundlinks (01494 794797) at 95 UK
Pounds.</p>

<strong>SECTION FOUR: EUROPEAN POLICY</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>E-EUROPE TARGETS 'DISAPPOINTINGLY</strong><br />
<strong>WEAK'</strong></p>
<p>The Royal National Institute for the Blind has attacked
"disappointingly weak" proposals from the European Commission's
eEurope initiative for improving accessibility for all to the
information society (see E-Access Bulletin, January 2000).</p>
<p>While welcoming the general aims of eEurope, the RNIB said in
its official response that "the targets and objectives with regard
to blind and partially sighted people are far below what might have
been expected".</p>
<p>In particular it said that the needs of disabled people should
have been considered throughout the document, and not just in their
own section. "A major failing of the communication is the
'ghettoisation' of the access needs of disabled people in section
seven . . . the theme of access should run throughout the areas of
action . . . Indeed, the targets in the other sections could not be
successfully met without the incorporation of disabled people".</p>
<p>Thus for example the programme's targets for employment; the
cost of accessing the internet; and access to healthcare online
should all take into account the importance of accessibility to
blind and visually impaired people, the RNIB said.</p>
<p>The most extreme criticism was reserved for the commission's
"inexcusable" blunder of releasing the eEurope document only in an
online format - pdf - that is not itself accessible. The RNIB said
it was "extremely disappointed to find that, ironically, a document
with a significant section on accessibility for disabled people,
was not in fact accessible to blind and partially sighted
people".</p>
<p>The RNIB said that the accessibility targets which were set in
section seven were too distant. "By the time they come into effect
they will be meaningless. The targets are also unnecessarily weak,
with too much emphasis on commitments and not enough on
actions".</p>
<p>Thus for example the commission has proposed a target by the end
of 2001 that: "The commission and member states should commit
themselves to making the design and content of all public web sites
accessible to people with disabilities". The RNIB says this target
should specify full adherence, not just "commitment".</p>
<p>Further revised and additional targets suggested by the RNIB
include:</p>
<p>"By end April 2000: The European Commission and member states
should adopt the standards of the Web Accessibility Initiative
(WAI) in relation to the design of web sites, web authoring tools
and agents.</p>
<p>"By end April 2001: All for-profit and public sector web sites
must adhere to WAI standards to ensure full participation.</p>
<p>"By end 2001: Development of a piece of browser software that
people with disabilities can use to browse the web, that is written
to WAI standards and that can read web sites that are written to
WAI standards. This software should be distributed to disabled net
users at no cost."</p>
