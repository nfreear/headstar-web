<p><strong>ISSUE 3, MARCH 2000</strong></p>
<p><strong>IN THIS ISSUE:</strong><br />

Downing Street's missed opportunity.</p>

<strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>FUNDING FEARS OVER ACCESS TO</strong><br />
<strong>LIBRARIES</strong></p>
<p>Funding for vital access projects for the use of public
libraries by blind and visually impaired people could be
jeopardised by the imminent absorption of the UK's Library and
Information Commission into a sprawling new Museums, Libraries and
Archives Commission, to include everything from libraries to art
galleries.</p>
<p>The current LIC has a strong track record on promoting access to
libraries by blind and visually impaired people, and has
commissioned more than a dozen major reports on the subject
including the modernisation of the catalogue system to include
alternative formats; the development of an efficient inter-library
loan scheme; the enrolment of any visually impaired library user
through only one of the many specialist providers; and a more
rational method for title selection.</p>
<p>The reports have been commissioned from a £200,000 grant from
the Department of Culture, Media and Sport which is subject to
renewal under the Treasury's comprehensive spending review -
already a subject of some nervousness in the visual impairment
sector. But the emergence next week of the new monster
Museums,<br />
Libraries and Archives Commission has led to greater concerns that
even if the money is renewed, it could be expected to cover not
only library access but also access to museums and art galleries,
and perhaps even be further stretched to cover access by other
major groups of disabled people such as those who have
hearing<br />
difficulties, physical access problems or learning
difficulties.</p>
<p>To date the grant has been administered jointly by the LIC and
Share The Vision (STV), the umbrella organisation for public
libraries and alternative format producers such as the RNIB and the
NLB. The funding has been widely welcomed as government recognition
that universal access has to be backed up by careful studies of
access problems.</p>
<p>One of the programme's most interesting recent findings is that
Microsoft NT is the best operating system for public libraries to
ensure their systems are optimally accessible for blind and
visually impaired people and people with other disabilities.</p>
<p>This finding comes in a report prepared by Tornado Labs for the
LIC. Tornado tested a number of software packages and concluded
that NT met its primary requirement that visually impaired users
should be able to customise a mainstream operating system, add
personal characteristics for screen readers and magnification
packages and then use these identifiers on other systems.</p>
<p>The problem for the research team was to find a package which
would allow the user to store characteristics, identify these in a
registry, copy them onto a carrier such as a floppy disk, reload
them into another system and the reproduce them without
complications. The NT system allows the construction of 'roaming
profiles' which can be used from any workstation on the system but
it also allows this until now elusive property of reinstalling on
another system.</p>
<p>The drawback of this solution - as the report admits - is that
NT is not likely to be used in the domestic environment, so many
users of public terminals who go through a lengthy<br />
customisation procedure will not be able to copy the relevant file
and use it at home. Most domestic users have Windows 9X on their
systems, and convergence between the two Microsoft products is
still some way off.</p>
<p>However, the importance of the LIC finding is that the
accessibility characteristics identified as vital will be
incorporated into any specification issued to tenderers for the
supply of equipment to public libraries. It is hoped that the
specification will be parachuted into other government departments
where public interaction is key, such as the health service.</p>
<p><strong>EMAIL THAT TALKS</strong></p>
<p>A real-time voice discussion service which operates using
ordinary email and computer microphones has been launched by US
firm HearMe. The company claims that<br />
VoiceCONTACT is the first technology of its kind, and says it will
remain free, although it plans to charge for upgrades with
additional functionality.</p>
<p>VoiceCONTACT users must visit the HearMe website at<br />
<a href=
"http://www.hearme.com/products/voicecontact/d">http://www.hearme.com/products/voicecontact/d</a>
ownload/<br />
The user is then prompted with instructions on how to send a live
voice e-mail discussion using ordinary PC microphones. HearMe sends
the invitation and the recipient then clicks on an embedded link in
the e-mail to join the conversation.</p>
<p>"With VoiceCONTACT, all you need to know is someone's email
address in order to invite them to a voice conversation. That's
what's so powerful. You don't need to know if they have particular
software, a user name, just their email address," company spokesman
Danielle Borel said.</p>
<p>Although the service is not specifically designed for people
with sight loss, HearMe says it could prove of great use to blind
people.</p>
<p>However there may currently be access problems for blind users
in using the web site and typing email addresses into the online
form. It seems likely that a more accessible version will have to
be designed before blind users can take full advantage. E-Access
Bulletin would be interested to hear from readers about their
experiences in trying to use HearMe, or if they know of any other
similar services.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY FOR INDEPENDENCE</strong></p>
<p>The RNIB is to hold a special action group meeting on 5 April on
'ICT for independence - developing a strategy for learning, working
and living'.</p>
<p>The meeting will plan the institute's strategy over the next few
years for developing and lobbying for access to all kinds of
information and communications technologies by blind and visually
impaired people. Topics under discussion will include access to
digital TV; the establishment of a partnership with a mainstream PC
distributor to ensure lower costs of access technology; ways to
alleviate technology access difficulties for deafblind people; and
the need to ensure a key presence on any industry group involve in
setting standards for new technologies such as Wireless Access
Protocol.</p>
<p>A full report of the meeting will be carried in our next
issue.</p>
<p><strong>'JOBSGOPUBLIC' GOES ACCESSIBLE</strong></p>
<p>The UK's major online gateway to jobs in the public sector -
'JobsGoPublic' - is creating an accessible version of its entire
web site, so blind and visually impaired people will be able to
access jobs information and accessible versions of application
forms.</p>
<p>JobsGoPublic carries recruitment details for a wide range of
public sector bodies including government departments, local
councils and NHS bodies. The accessible version of the site will
conform to the BOBBY web access standard.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the site is not yet functional, but it is
promised online in the next week or two at:<br />
<a href=
"http://bobby.jobsgopublic.com/">http://bobby.jobsgopublic.com/</a><br />

And the main (non-accessible) site is at:
www.jobsgopublic.co.uk/</p>
<p><strong>DOWNING STREET'S MISSED</strong><br />
<strong>OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Access to technology by blind, visually impaired and disabled
people was conspicuous by its absence from a report unveiled by
Prime Minister Tony Blair last month into a strategy for realising
universal access to the internet.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned from consultant BoozAllen &amp;
Hamilton, warned of the potential for a digital divide to open up
in the UK over the next three years, seriously disadvantaging
people and communities who were not connected to the internet and
equipped with the skills to use it properly.</p>
<p>However, greater accessibility for blind and visually impaired
people - surely a crucial factor in any programme to universalise
internet access - was not specifically mentioned as a policy
priority. Among the recommendations that were included was the
classification of<br />
telecommunication companies as central utilities; offering tax
incentives to companies that provide access to underserved
populations; encouraging National Lottery grants for relevant
projects; issuing 'internet credits' for free access to public
terminals; providing the unemployed with free access; and providing
incentives for more people to access government services
online.</p>

<hr />
<strong>SECTION TWO: NEW TECHNOLOGY -</strong><br />
<strong>AUDIO DESCRIPTION</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>DIE HARD - BUT FIRST, LISTEN HARD</strong></p>
<p>You are watching the film 'Die Hard', and Bruce Willis is
talking on the phone to a policeman. Injured and trapped in a
hijacked tower block after a gunfight, Willis sounds tired and
nervous. A blind or visually impaired member of the audience can
pick this up, but what they would not realise is that, as Willis is
talking, he is pulling a piece of glass from the sole of his
foot.</p>
<p>Recent research shows that many people with sight loss find
films or television programmes extremely difficult to follow.
Reasons for this include the fact that there are no verbal
descriptions of subtitles; there is often confusion between
characters; scenes change too fast; and films and dramas often
conclude without any dialogue.</p>
<p>There is a solution, however: audio description, the verbal
description of scenes that occur between periods of dialogue, which
can be carried as a separate sound-track on digital television or
in specially adapted cinemas.</p>
<p>The RNIB has launched a campaign, Talking Images', to raise £2.3
million to help film makers and producers set up audio description,
find relevant technical information and get in touch with skilled
'describers'.</p>
<p>Audio describing should only cost about £6,000 per film and the
campaign aims to raise awareness in the film industry about its
benefits for those with sight loss. Once a film is completed,
scenes are described and recorded on audio track which is then
mixed and transmitted alongside the film using equipment such as
the Cinetracker in cinemas. From there the signal is broadcast to
members of the audience wearing headsets.<br />
However, although £6,000 is a tiny fraction of the production costs
of a film, the RNIB has dug in for a long campaign and expects few
changes in the short term.</p>
<p>For television, audio description will only be available in the
summer through providers of digital terrestrial TV although the
RNIB is also lobbying cable and satellite providers to provide a
service.</p>
<p>Viewers will need a special module for set top boxes or
integrated digital televisions which can decode the audio
description track. Guidelines from the ITC state that 2% of
programmes should be audio-described this year and the targets rise
by 2% every 2 years after 2000.</p>
<p>The RNIB has welcomed last month's increase in the TV licence
fee concession for blind people to 50%, but has warned it should
not be used as an excuse for broadcasters to ignore access issues
like audio description. "The 50% concession is a recognition that
although 94% of blind people watch TV, they do not get the full
benefit of what TV has to offer," said RNIB's Broadcasting Officer
Denise Evans.</p>
<p>Evans warned that description technology may be costly and that
the government should subsidise the additional module that is
necessary for set-top boxes. "Without this, blind people's access
to television could remain a matter of wealth".</p>
<p>Programmes identified by those with sight loss as particularly
difficult to follow without description include films, dramas,
soaps and wildlife documentaries. However, the RNIB is campaigning
for programme makers to transmit more audio-described programmes
and want to see a wide variety available.</p>
<p>There are currently 60 videos available in described format
include Four Weddings and a Funeral, Junglebook, Braveheart, Hear
My Song, Lady and the Tramp, Little Mermaid, the Horse Whisperer,
and yes . . . Die Hard. For more information on described videos

<strong>SECTION THREE - EDUCATION:</strong><br />
<strong>VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>STAFFORDSHIRE UNIVERSITY PIONEERS</strong><br />
<strong>RESEARCH INTO ACCESS PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p>Staffordshire University is investigating access by the blind
and visually impaired to 'virtual learning environments' (VLEs)
including internet-based education.</p>
<p>Staffordshire has pioneered the use of VLEs for its staff and
students: in the 1998-99 academic year 3,500 students used the
systems, and the figure is expected to jump to 6,000 this year.</p>
<p>Virtual learning means resources can be accessed by students
online in an organised manner. Students and tutors can search
published material on a server and gather relevant items in a
'basket'. All users can communicate with each other using email and
notice boards, and the use of content is tracked giving feedback to
tutors. VLEs can also be used to improve central administration,
assign work and track submitted work.</p>
<p>Mark Stiles, manager of the university's Learning Development
Centre, told E-Access Bulletin that while Staffordshire has a good
track record on access to information technology, feedback from
some visually impaired students showed they were experiencing
difficulties with the virtual learning environment.</p>
<p>The study will look at difficulties faced by those in four
categories of disability including the visually impaired. Stiles
expects the study to be completed in the next few weeks, when the
results will be published.</p>
<p>The Staffordshire project is one of more than a dozen across the
UK supported by DISinHE, otherwise known by its snappy full title
of the Central Clearing House for Information Technology for
Accessibility and Disability in Higher Education. Several others of
these projects are focused specifically on solving problems
experienced by the blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p>Funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK
Higher Education Funding Councils, DISinHE's overarching objective
is "to make sure all information is available in some form or
another to all people."</p>
<p>Established in 1998 as part of the Department of Applied
Computing at the University of Dundee, DISinHE is focused on
tackling five accessibility problems: excessive graphic portrayal
of information; the requirement to use a mouse; poor structuring of
content; excessive use of cutting edge technology which is not
fully supported; and poor choice in output options.</p>
<p>The organisation says the victims of these problems are most
often disabled users who are visually impaired, dyslexic, have
motor disability or are cognitively impaired. However, it says poor
design affects everyone.</p>
<p>Another study backed by DISinHE is one examining voice
recognition software, at University College Worcester. This aims to
develop effective training and usage guidelines for good practice
in voice recognition which can be used throughout the university
and elsewhere. Meanwhile City University is looking at the web for
people with visual impairment. Study objectives include a review of
software and other systems that assist those with sight loss to
access the web.</p>

<hr />
<strong>SECTION FOUR:</strong><br />
<strong>VIEWPOINT - ACCESSIBILITY AND COST</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>MACHINES THAT TALK MAKE</strong><br />
<strong>PERFECT COMMERCIAL SENSE</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers of technological devices often feel they cannot
easily make them more accessible to blind people because they are -
quite rightly - concerned about the cost of building better
displays,<br />
speech conversion or speech recognition into their products. They
may use the<br />
argument in their defence that visually impaired are merely one
interest group among many.</p>
<p>But the point they are missing is that one day - if indeed it is
not happening already - the majority of sighted people will also
have access difficulties because they will become overloaded with
visual cues.</p>
<p>Visually impaired people have a uniquely insightful experience
of technology,<br />
ironically because of the very difficulties they face in accessing
it. They are<br />
therefore well-placed to advise<br />
manufacturers on how easy it is to use various devices, and how
designs might be altered for the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p>How many people really bother to read<br />
information that they are being charged for their ATM transactions
when the<br />
charge information is displayed as they take their card? How many
sighted<br />
people know what the icons on the<br />
computer do without the text labels? If manufacturers concentrate
exclusively on visual information, these problems arise. Currently
everything from mobile web<br />
browsing to in-car navigation systems are on displays which are
either far too<br />
cramped, or inappropriately large in a situation where a car driver
should be looking at the road.</p>
<p>To take another example, it is well known that many people have
trouble setting<br />
their video recorders, and there is still only a visual indication
when you enter an invalid 'Video Plus' number. Why not use an
audible signal, which would both help alert a sighted user and be
vital for a visually impaired user?</p>
<p>Accessible design should be commercially viable, since disabled
people are among the highest users of technology. The popular
'Parrot' talking organiser was not designed for blind people, but
once it became popular in this market, its manufacturer realised it
would be worthwhile to modify it and build in new features
specifically targeted at blind users.</p>
<p>There could be much wider use of speech synthesis technology in
consumer goods for the benefit of everyone, for example in car
radios and traffic navigation systems where the driver could be
concentrating on the road. If this technology were applied in
volume,<br />
implementation costs should fall significantly.</p>
<p>Much of the technology behind text-to-speech chips already
exists, and price need not remain a barrier to implementation for
long. Speech chips are getting more and more powerful while
remaining relatively stable in price. The increase in power should
provide faster, more responsive and better quality speech.</p>
<p>If we can demonstrate the benefits of this approach for general
use it could be<br />
instrumental in bringing the cost of<br />
accessibility down to a point where it is no longer a cause for its
exclusion.</p>
