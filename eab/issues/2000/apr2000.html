<p><strong>CONFUSION MARS INTRODUCTION OF TV LICENCE FEE
DISCOUNT</strong></p>
<p>Widespread confusion about how to claim the new 50% television
licence</p>
<p>fee discount for blind people, and about who is eligible, has
been reported</p>
<p>following the government's announcement of the discount in
February.</p>
<p>The discount - to run from 1 April 2000 - was widely welcomed as
a huge</p>
<p>improvement on the previous discount for the blind of a mere
£1.25. However,</p>
<p>confusion has focused on whether the discount applies only to
licence holders;</p>
<p>how people can apply for the new concession; and whether those
receiving</p>
<p>the old discount qualify automatically for the 50%
reduction.</p>
<p>Diane Evans, Information Officer at the Ty Clyd Independent
Living Centre</p>
<p>for disabled people in South Wales and herself registered as
blind, told</p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin that her own enquiries to the responsible
government</p>
<p>agency, TV Licensing, on behalf of the people at her centre, had
not received</p>
<p>a satisfactory response.</p>
<p>"When I telephoned the TV licence people I was told that there
was no set</p>
<p>procedure for someone to claim the 50% reduction. After several
hasty conversations</p>
<p>I was told that people who were already claiming would receive a
form through</p>
<p>the post and they would have to take this with a copy of their
registration</p>
<p>certificate to the post office or send it to them. I did point
out that</p>
<p>they were sending forms to registered blind people and some of
them would</p>
<p>not always have someone on hand to fill in the form. They then
said that</p>
<p>the post office could fill in the form.</p>
<p>"The next problem is that a large proportion of the registered
blind with</p>
<p>us have not claimed before because it was not worth all the
hassle for</p>
<p>the small sum of money they offered - myself included. This
seemed to throw</p>
<p>them into a panic and they asked if I would send in a letter to
customer</p>
<p>services. Which I have done and as yet, still await a
reply."</p>
<p>The RNIB, which also sought clarification from TV Licensing on
behalf of</p>
<p>its members after receiving a large number of enquiries, said
the fact</p>
<p>that some Post Offices had not been briefed about the new
discount prior</p>
<p>to the announcement had compounded uncertainty for some
people.</p>
<p>TV Licensing has now offered clarification on some of the
outstanding points.</p>
<p>It says that all applicants must be registered blind to qualify
for the</p>
<p>new discount, and that proof of registration therefore must be
shown at</p>
<p>the Post Office where most people buy the licence. If applicants
currently</p>
<p>pay for their licence by Direct Debit they should telephone TV
Licensing</p>
<p>on 0845 602 3334, who will advise them how to send in their
blindness certificate</p>
<p>to obtain the discount. People who received the £1.25 concession
prior</p>
<p>to the introduction of the new discount do need to re-apply.</p>
<p>The discount applies to all households where there is at least
one person</p>
<p>who is registered as blind. Refunds will be available for people
who have</p>
<p>purchased new licences prior to the announcement.</p>
<p>The government also announced in February that all people over
the age</p>
<p>of 75 are eligible for a free licence from November 1. People
who are registered</p>
<p>blind and who also are or will be over-75 at that time are able
to purchase</p>
<p>a part-licence with the 50% discount to run up to November.</p>
<p>However, Ms Evans says she is still waiting for a proper
response to her</p>
<p>queries. "I have yet to hear back on whether there is any
information on</p>
<p>the scheme that I can obtain in a medium that our clients can
use, such</p>
<p>as large print. And I still have concerns about people who pay
by Direct</p>
<p>Debit having to send their certificates in by post - what
happens if they</p>
<p>go missing?"</p>
<p><strong>QUALIFIED WELCOME FOR EDUCATION ACCESS
RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>Disabled students have given a qualified welcome to UK
government plans</p>
<p>to guarantee disabled people new rights to technology and tackle
discrimination</p>
<p>in the education system.</p>
<p>The draft Special Educational Needs and Disability Rights in
Education</p>
<p>Bill, published last month, is designed to plug the hole left by
the Disability</p>
<p>Discrimination Act (1995), which excluded education. It aims to
introduce</p>
<p>enforceable civil rights for disabled people in education,
including improved</p>
<p>access to technology.</p>
<p>The National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, Skill,
predicts that</p>
<p>institutions will need to examine technology provision in a
number of areas</p>
<p>including all electronic curriculum materials; all learning and
teaching</p>
<p>tools provided electronically; computing and intranet provision
for students;</p>
<p>the library; information technology support services; and
institutions'</p>
<p>web sites.</p>
<p>Under the new regime institutions will be forced to make
reasonable adjustments</p>
<p>where 'any arrangements, including physical features of
premises, for services</p>
<p>place a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage.'
Unjustified less</p>
<p>favourable treatment will also be unlawful.</p>
<p>Examples cited include special training in new technologies and
extra provision</p>
<p>such as voice recognition software for those who cannot use
standard hardware</p>
<p>and applications; and a suggestion that blind students should be
given</p>
<p>a list of all written articles that are required reading at the
beginning</p>
<p>of each year so that libraries can arrange for these to be put
on audio</p>
<p>tape.</p>
<p>"The bill will have a big impact on technology provision," said
Skill Policy</p>
<p>Director Sophie Corlett. "Increasingly we are aware that scant
attention</p>
<p>is being paid to accessibility." However, the body is seeking a
number</p>
<p>of changes, including extension of the new rules to funding
councils, inspection</p>
<p>agencies, professional bodies and work placement providers, all
of which</p>
<p>it argues have a crucial role in influencing student
education.</p>
<p>Skill also says the bill does not offer students on work
placements enough</p>
<p>protection. "We are coming across more and more students who are
being</p>
<p>refused work placements or refused entry to a course which has
work placements</p>
<p>because they are disabled," said Corlett.</p>

<p><strong>PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LESS LIKELY TO HAVE INTERNET
ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>People with disabilities are far less likely than others to have
access</p>
<p>to the internet or own a computer according to research
published in the</p>
<p>US last month.</p>
<p>While more than 50% of people who have no disability have a
computer in</p>
<p>their household, the equivalent figure for those who are
disabled is just</p>
<p>24%. The gap in internet access is even more pronounced. Almost
three times</p>
<p>as many people without disability have access to the net at home
compared</p>
<p>to those who are disabled - 31% versus 11%. Only 4% of disabled
people</p>
<p>have access to the internet outside the home compared to more
than a fifth</p>
<p>of those who are not disabled.</p>
<p>"People with disabilities are perhaps the single segment of
society with</p>
<p>the most to gain from the new technologies of the electronic
age," says</p>
<p>report author Stephen Kaye from the Disability Statistics
Center, University</p>
<p>of California San Francisco. "Yet they have among the lowest
rates of use</p>
<p>of these technologies."</p>
<p>The researchers argue that the huge difference cannot be
explained by the</p>
<p>fact that the disabled are more likely to be elderly and
therefore less</p>
<p>likely to use new technology. Significant differences in
computer ownership</p>
<p>and internet access were also found for the age group 15 to
64.</p>
<p>Kaye said the differences in income can explain much of the
difference</p>
<p>in access rates, as those who are disabled may need specialised
software.</p>
<p>However, he does predict higher access rates among the disabled
in the</p>
<p>future. "The advent of lower-cost computing - including the free
computers</p>
<p>that come with extended subscription to an internet service
provider -</p>
<p>may help to make this technology more available," he says.</p>

<p><strong>VIRTUAL THINK-TANK DEBATES TECHNOLOGY
DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>The role of governments worldwide in encouraging accessible
technology</p>
<p>design was a key topic of debate at Boosting the Net Economy
2000, a global</p>
<p>'virtual think-tank' hosted on the web last month by the
publishers of</p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin, Headstar, with sponsorship from Bull.</p>
<p>Think-tank member Professor Elsa Rosenblad of the Chalmers
University of</p>
<p>Technology, Sweden, said that governments and intergovernmental
bodies</p>
<p>had an important role to play in ensuring that the design of
technology</p>
<p>products was accessible to all parts of society, including older
people</p>
<p>and disabled people, although a direct legislative approach was
not desirable.</p>
<p>"I don't think it is successful to force any kind of technical
development.</p>
<p>But I can see two ways of reaching the same goal. One is
enforcement using</p>
<p>ISO-standards, the other is research to create new knowledge of
the user's</p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>"ISO-standards, especially ISO 9241 and ISO 9355 regarding
ergonomic requirements,</p>
<p>could be used for control, criteria and evaluation of products
at governmental</p>
<p>and other greater purchases. But probably a more successful way
of achieving</p>
<p>products that are accessible to all would be governmental
investment in</p>
<p>research of new knowledge of the user's situation. The severe
problem of</p>
<p>accessibility is the lack of knowledge on the part of the
designer of the</p>
<p>cognitive and physical abilities of the individual user. If this
knowledge</p>
<p>was available, much better products would reach the market, as
customer</p>
<p>orientation is an aim today."</p>
<p>A full report of the online debate is due to be posted onto its
web site</p>
<p>on 10 May. See:</p>

<p><strong>PLAY TIME</strong></p>
<p>It's not only dull work-related software that can be made
accessible: 'Accessible</p>
<p>Games' is a library of simple computer games designed for blind
and visually</p>
<p>impaired computer users. Games on offer include WordPlay,
Battleships,</p>
<p>BlackJack and Yahtzee, and they interface directly with speech
synthesis</p>
<p>software.</p>
<p>The games require you to download the Visual Basic 6.0 run time
library</p>
<p>first, a 1 Megabyte download. After that trial versions of the
games can</p>
<p>be downloaded for free, and after evaluation the registered
versions are</p>
<p>pretty cheap (around 10 US Dollars each). See:</p>

<p><strong>SECTION TWO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>RNIB INFORMATION SOCIETY ADVISORY GROUP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SPECIAL EXTENDED REPORT</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The need to base technology initiatives around individuals'
social needs,</p>
<p>rather than the technologies themselves, was stressed at a
special meeting</p>
<p>of the RNIB's Information Society Advisory Group on 5 April.</p>
<p>The meeting was designed to take stock of the institute's work
promoting</p>
<p>access to information and communications technologies and help
set future</p>
<p>priorities. Ian Bruce, RNIB Director General, said: "For blind
people to</p>
<p>take charge of their lives they need the same information as
everyone else,</p>
<p>and additional specific information. This is particularly
important nowadays</p>
<ul>
<li>information is power."</li>
</ul>
<p>Fazilet Hadi, RNIB Director of Policy, said it was important to
anchor</p>
<p>new technology projects in widely-used current technology
systems, like</p>
<p>Braille.</p>
<p>It was also important to understand the differences between the
needs of</p>
<p>various types of blind and visually impaired technology users,
Ms Hadi</p>
<p>said. "Have they been visually impaired all their lives, or have
they had</p>
<p>to find new ways of working in the forties, or new techniques in
their</p>
<p>seventies?"</p>
<p>Keith Gladstone, RNIB Head of Information Systems, said everyone
was now</p>
<p>surrounded by far more information than they can cope with, so
the ability</p>
<p>to scan and filter information was vital. For blind and visually
impaired</p>
<p>people, however, that ability is vastly reduced, making it much
harder</p>
<p>for them to deal with 'information overload'.</p>
<p>An increased number of information channels, for example with
digital television,</p>
<p>the increasing specialisation of each channel and the growth of
unmediated</p>
<p>or unmoderated streams of information via the internet are all
adding to</p>
<p>the burden of choice, he said. It was important to understand
the real</p>
<p>impact all these changes are having on peoples' lives and
address the</p>
<p>issues arising, which may or may not involve technology
directly.</p>
<p>John Gill, Chief Scientist in the institute's Scientific
Research Unit,</p>
<p>and Steve Tyler, Digital (ICT) Access Manager, listed some of
the key technological</p>
<p>developments likely to have a major influence on the lives of
blind and</p>
<p>visually impaired people in the next decade. They included:</p>
<h1><a name="section-1." id="section-1.">* the convergence of
mobile communications, digital television and web</a></h1>
<p>services so that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell one
technological</p>
<p>device from another;</p>
<h1><a name="section-2." id="section-2.">* the development of
interactive public services via digital television,</a></h1>
<p>such as health services;</p>
<h1><a name="section-3." id="section-3.">* the development of
digital radio (Digital Audio Broadcasting), with on-screen</a></h1>
<p>displays, and its convergence with the Internet and
Internet-based radio</p>
<p>stations;</p>
<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* the use of mobile
telephony as a location system, with accuracy likely</a></h1>
<p>to be refined to a few metres in the near future;</p>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* the growth in a 5-10
year timescale of visual substitution systems, which</a></h1>
<p>capture information using cameras, process them rapidly using
special algorithms</p>
<p>to extract key features and then present them to users in a
multi-modal</p>
<p>display; and</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* in the longer term, the
development of direct cortical stimulation to</a></h1>
<p>mimic sight should advance, although this field currently seems
stalled</p>
<p>because of an imperfect understanding of how the brain
works.</p>
<p>There were also important social background trends to bear in
mind in the</p>
<p>medium term, Gill said. These included demographic changes which
would</p>
<p>see more older people, with multiple sight problems such as poor
contrast</p>
<p>sensitivity and poor accommodation. Inclusive design of systems
like digital</p>
<p>television sets would therefore become even more important: if
people had</p>
<p>to press buttons on a control and read a screen at the same
time, for example,</p>
<p>such multiple sight problems would become a severe handicap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, competitive pressure on manufacturers is so high
that they</p>
<p>have little time or resources to make their technologies
accessible, he</p>
<p>said. This meant legislation to enforce accessibility would be
needed,</p>
<p>but before that could be put in place further work was needed to
establish</p>
<p>scientific standards on which to base such legislation.</p>
<p>Tyler said that although the high-tech business arena is
extremely complex</p>
<p>and fast-moving, the RNIB must make it a priority to deal with
manufacturers</p>
<p>directly at the same time as pressing the government for
legislative changes.</p>
<p>"We must sell mainstream access into business. Also mainstream
development</p>
<p>is vital, because visually impaired people mainly access
information through</p>
<p>ordinary, not specialist devices."</p>
<p>But as well as presenting access challenges, the web and other
technologies</p>
<p>offered enormous possibilities for the RNIB in providing its own
information</p>
<p>services, he said.</p>
<p>Stephen King, Director of the RNIB's Technical and Consumer
Services, said</p>
<p>that in tackling access issues it was vital to take an
integrated approach</p>
<p>which simultaneously combines researching user needs; finding
technical</p>
<p>solutions; working on industry standards; and pushing for
legislation.</p>
<p>"A technical solution on its own doesn't work, it's just a
pilot. A standard</p>
<p>on its own doesn't work: it needs legislation. And a regulatory
framework</p>
<p>on its own doesn't work, there needs to be a technical solution.
So we</p>
<p>need to take an integrated approach."</p>
<p>It was also vital to spot and influence access issues very early
on in</p>
<p>the development of a technology, he said, because technologies
are designed</p>
<p>very early on. There was therefore a corresponding need to
understand what</p>
<p>the requirements are from the blind and visually impaired
community at</p>
<p>an early stage, based on solid research of how blind people use
technology.</p>
<p>Without this, lobbyists could find themselves in the
embarrassing position</p>
<p>of influencing a design only to find it did not actually meet a
real need</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>There was also a need to influence the hearts and minds not only
of politicians</p>
<p>but of the designers of new technology - many of them young
people - to</p>
<p>make them want to participate. "If the 25-year-old who is
designing an</p>
<p>interface for everybody to use does not understand what we need
and want</p>
<p>to do it, it will not get designed in. So we need to work with
industry,</p>
<p>work out how they are going to develop standards and influence
them with</p>
<p>sound ergonomic research".</p>
<p>Finally, the RNIB should explore all possibilities to work
closely with</p>
<p>international partners to draw in wider expertise and to help
influence</p>
<p>an industry which is global, he said. The benchmark for future
success</p>
<p>should be the current design of a telephone keypad, he said,
which is universal</p>
<p>and was developed with input from the RNIB.</p>
<p>Colin Low, Vice Chairman of the RNIB, suggested that the RNIB
should try</p>
<p>to influence the work of the new Disability Rights Commission,
of which</p>
<p>he is a member. "The commission is an institution which the
government</p>
<p>has created to move disability issues up the political agenda.
We need</p>
<p>to take it at face value and work with it.</p>
<p>"Although I have to say that promoting inclusive design is not
high up</p>
<p>on the commission's agenda, unless people like us do a bit of
pushing it</p>
<p>might not get as high up the agenda as it should be." He said
there was</p>
<p>a general tension within the commission over whether to put its
weight</p>
<p>behind calls for new legislation or whether education and
persuasion were</p>
<p>the way forward. The outcome was likely to be a combination -
"advocacy</p>
<p>with teeth".</p>
<p>Initial conclusions of the ISAG meeting have been collated by
Stephen King</p>
<p>in a discussion document to be placed before the RNIB's Policy
Committee</p>
<p>on 10 May. After discussion this paper will lead towards a green
paper</p>
<p>developed over the summer to feed into RNIB's strategic planning
process</p>
<p>in the autumn.</p>

<p><strong>PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS FROM ISAG STRATEGY MEETING, BY
STEPHEN KING</strong></p>
<p><strong>PEOPLE FIRST</strong></p>
<p>We need to be careful to start with people and their needs and
wants first,</p>
<p>rather than the technology. An overall framework of ensuring
people can</p>
<p>carry on doing what other people do is a helpful way of
prioritising.</p>
<p>We developed a broad framework around ensuring access and use of
financial</p>
<p>and payment systems; communications systems; everyday cultural
media and</p>
<p>events; the technologies used in everyday learning and
employment; health</p>
<p>support information and systems; everyday living (shopping,
transport,</p>
<p>housekeeping, eating out, etc); and citizenship. In all these
areas we</p>
<p>anticipate change in the way people interact with technology
over the next</p>
<p>few years.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SOCIETY IS WIDER THAN INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>The human intermediary, skilled in description, may become even
more important,</p>
<p>and the explosion of available information may mean an
information overload,</p>
<p>leading to the need for new strategies. There is the potential
for significant</p>
<p>changes to the way we live, eg closing bank branches or less
travel. The</p>
<p>concept of universal or inclusive standards of service are as
important</p>
<p>as concepts of inclusive system and product design.</p>
<p><strong>LIVING WITH NEW AND OLD TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>Because of the affordability issue and the demographics of
people with</p>
<p>serious sight loss, many people we deal with will be using old
technologies</p>
<p>for a long time. Particularly if the new technology proposes
significant</p>
<p>new learning overheads. At the same time other segments are
likely to be</p>
<p>early adopters of new technologies that bring significant
advantages. The</p>
<p>PC is a good example of this. Digital TV is likely to be a much
bigger</p>
<p>example. We are going to have to work with a long tail of old
technologies.</p>
<p><strong>WORK NEEDED IN RELATION TO EXISTING
TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>Many of the existing technologies (mobile phone, PC, TV, Bank
ATMs, etc)</p>
<p>still present major challenges but also benefits. And they will
be with</p>
<p>us for many years. The barrier is training, enabling people to
(continue</p>
<p>to) use. This is a huge resource issue still, enabling people to
take advantage</p>
<p>of what is already there.</p>
<p><strong>DEVELOPING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND USER
NEEDS</strong></p>
<p>We need to understand technologies and their likely impacts
early enough</p>
<p>in the development cycle to influence them. And develop user
needs, perhaps</p>
<p>when few users know what the benefits may be. The key issue
however is</p>
<p>to ensure we develop user needs from good research.</p>
<p><strong>INTEGRATED STRATEGIES FOR INFLUENCING NEW
TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We concluded that no one approach is enough on its own. We need
well developed</p>
<p>campaigns: for regulation, for hearts and minds, and for
funding. We need</p>
<p>good human factors research. We need to have persuasive and
expert consultants</p>
<p>there at the right time to give advice, we need technical
solutions, and</p>
<p>as important, demand from consumers. We need to develop long
term sophisticated</p>
<p>strategies and stick with them.</p>
<p><strong>EMERGING PRIORITY AREAS EG BROADCASTING</strong></p>
<p>There was a general consensus that the changing face of
broadcasting and</p>
<p>its new interactive dimensions was a priority area for us to
increase our</p>
<p>efforts. This is likely to feed strongly into cultural, daily
living and</p>
<p>financial inclusion. To do this we need to build on our industry
contacts.</p>
<p><strong>STRATEGIES FOR SKILLING AND REACHING PEOPLE</strong></p>
<p>The other huge challenge is to develop new strategies for
skilling people</p>
<p>to (re)learn how to use everyday technology, or adaptions that
can help.</p>
<p>Though inclusive design may make things easier, the generality
of training</p>
<p>and instructions assume visual feedback. Perhaps this is the
major area</p>
<p>for us to develop our volunteer activity at the field level.
This connected</p>
<p>to trained describers.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNAL ORGANISATION AND COLLABORATION</strong></p>
<p>To deliver the complex and multi dimensional strategies needed,
we need</p>
<p>expertise from right across the organisation. We have to get
better at</p>
<p>working across the organisation. We also need to be able to move
and respond</p>
<p>very quickly. Inevitably this will mean problems and costly
mistakes and</p>
<p>blind alleys. But we have to empower people to act at the speed
industry</p>
<p>and commerce are working to.</p>
<p><strong>BUILDING SERVICES ON WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of expertise and services around information and
we should</p>
<p>build out from these. Our strategic intent is knowledge and
expertise development</p>
<p>and beacon of good practice so we can campaign effectively as
well as provide</p>
<p>service. Overall, building services from where we are is lower
risk than</p>
<p>moving into new markets and new products.</p>
<p>We already act as a file translation intermediary (braille/large
print/audio)</p>
<p>and we need to adapt this to adapting/enhancing all sorts of
digital media.</p>
<p>We have an excellent web site, where we can develop chat rooms,
emotional</p>
<p>support services, webcasting and other audio initiatives. We
have expert</p>
<p>information design knowledge that can be developed into
consultancy skills</p>
<p>as well as courses for delivery by us and others.</p>
<p>We have expertise in organising volunteers, where we could
develop new</p>
<p>skills, and develop courses and structures for a new generation
of information</p>
<p>intermediaries (readers, describers, etc). We have good contacts
in the</p>
<p>broadcast media and arts communities that we can build on.</p>
<p><strong>WORK WITH INDUSTRY IN THE SAME WAY WE WORK WITH
GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p>Influencing industry is probably now equally or more important
that influencing</p>
<p>government. We need to develop these skills and build supporter
networks.</p>
<p>This will involve behaving in a more "businesslike" way, which
will be</p>
<p>a cultural challenge. Ideas such as "accessibility awards" in
the industry's</p>
<p>own awards structure rather than our own awards such as See it
Right.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE - THE WEB:</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPEECH-ENABLED PORTALS</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TALKING TO THE WEB? JUST SAY QUACK</strong></p>
<p>A new breed of web portal that you can access by ordinary
telephone - no</p>
<p>need for a 'web-enabled' mobile phone - is under development in
the US</p>
<p>and set to cross the Atlantic, in a potentially valuable
development for</p>
<p>blind and visually impaired web users.</p>
<p>Several big players have already explored the possibilities of
voice access</p>
<p>to their e-commerce sites in the US including telecoms giant
AT&amp;T, the</p>
<p>online video store BigStar.com and the auction site
Priceline.com. However,</p>
<p>it is now recognised that the potential of voice access extends
beyond</p>
<p>e-commerce to new 'voice portals' - gateways to a whole range of
information</p>
<p>online that can be accessed using a phone instead of a visual
browser.</p>
<p>The services generally use an automated system that responds to
a combination</p>
<p>of voice and key-pad commands. They can then translate the
information</p>
<p>you give into commands to seek certain information from the
internet, which</p>
<p>can then be relayed back to you using a computer-generated
voice.</p>
<p>One of the first voice portals, launched this month across the
US, is Quack.com,</p>
<p>which allows anyone to access specific information from the
internet by</p>
<p>phone. Users dial a freephone number and speak to an automated
host who</p>
<p>guides the caller to the information they want by asking simple
questions.</p>
<p>Central to the service is its ability to offer 'personalised'
information.</p>
<p>When users sign up, they key in preferences on the Quack.com web
site which</p>
<p>then allows callers to automatically access information on
specific share</p>
<p>prices, regional weather, specific sports teams and other topics
via the</p>
<p>phone.</p>
<p>"While our service wasn't originally designed with visually
impaired people</p>
<p>in mind, it has become apparent that it's very useful for that
particular</p>
<p>group," Quack spokesman Alex Quilici told E-Access Bulletin. He
said visually</p>
<p>impaired users have offered positive feedback and suggestions
for additional</p>
<p>services.</p>
<p>Information (which is channelled from a variety of different web
sources)</p>
<p>is currently limited to news and lifestyle topics including the
weather,</p>
<p>film reviews and news, restaurants, sports, stocks and shares,
travel and</p>
<p>traffic news. Quack intends to offer more sophisticated services
in due</p>
<p>course, including the ability to shop online. "As a result of
the technology's</p>
<p>flexibility, the company can quickly add new applications and
features,</p>
<p>and a range of new consumer services is currently in
development," the</p>
<p>company says.</p>
<p>Just as impressive as the technology is the fact that Quack is
free to</p>
<p>use. Calls are made to freephone numbers and registration is
free. So where's</p>
<p>the catch? Although the Quack web site fails to refer to it
directly, the</p>
<p>service does carry short advertisements which are slotted in
depending</p>
<p>on what information is being accessed by the caller. However,
Quilici says</p>
<p>that all ads are opt-in (in other words the user has an option
to request</p>
<p>further details) and must be informative - "For example, if
someone requests</p>
<p>a baseball score for the Minnesota Twins, the ad might be 'would
you like</p>
<p>to know about the Twins upcoming home games?"</p>
<p>So when will the UK see its first voice portal? Given the
companies involved</p>
<p>in voice access to the internet a UK appearance appears certain
in the</p>
<p>near future. IBM, AT&amp;T, Amazon.com and Deloitte and Touche
are all involved</p>
<p>in developing the technology and it is inevitable they will be
looking</p>
<p>to markets beyond the US in the next few years.</p>
