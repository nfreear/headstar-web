EDITOR'S NOTE:
Welcome to the first edition of E-access Bulletin, 
an exciting new project sponsored by the Royal 
National Institute for the Blind, with further 
support from the National Library for the Blind and 
the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. It is an 
email and web-only newsletter, covering all issues 
relating to the use of information and 
communications technology by blind and visually 
impaired people - issues of great topicality and vital 
importance, if the UK government is to achieve its 
ambition of building an inclusive 'information 
society'.

I hope very much you enjoy this newsletter.

EU MOVES TO ENSURE INCLUSIVE 
INFORMATION SOCIETY

The European Commission has launched a major 
new initiative - 'eEurope' - aimed at creating a 
socially inclusive information society, including a 
proposed new mandatory requirement for all 
government and other public service internet sites 
to be made accessible to the special access software 
used by blind and visually impaired people.

The move coincides with the Portugese Presidency 
of the EU - no coincidence, as Portugal is the first 
European country where web accessibility is 
already law. 'eEurope' focuses on ten priority areas, 
aimed at bringing every citizen online; creating a 
digitally literate Europe; and ensuring that the 
whole process is socially inclusive. Priority Seven 
is 'eParticipation for the disabled'.

Targets on accessibility, released for consultation, 
include:

"By the end of 2000: The Commission and member 
states should review the relevant legislation and 
standards programmes dealing with the information 
society, with a view to ensuring their conformity 
with accessibility principles. The Commission will 
[also] propose a recommendation to member states 
to take account of the requirements of people with 
disabilities in the procurement of information and 
communications products and services.

"By the end of 2001: The Commission and member 
states should commit themselves to making the 
design and content of all public web sites 
accessible to people with disabilities.

"By the end of 2002: The Commission will support 
the creation of a network of centres of excellence, 
at least one in each member state, that will develop 
a European curriculum module in Design-for-All to 
train designers and engineers."

The eEurope home page is at:
www.europa.eu.int/comm/dg13/eeurope/home.htm
From here, one can access the eEurope consultation 
document - ironically available in Adobe pdf file 
only, not the most accessible of formats.

The Portugese internet accessibility group, PASIG, 
has set up an eEurope-People With Disabilities 
discussion group. You can find out more at:

COUNTDOWN TO CSUN

The countdown has begun to this year's vast annual 
'Technologies and persons with disabilities' 
conference at the California State University Center 
on Disabilities, more commonly known as CSUN, 
to be held on March 20-25.

Among the many new technologies on display will 
be BrookesTalk, a specially adapted web browser 
for the blind and visually impaired developed by 
the School of Computing and Mathematical 
Sciences at Oxford Brookes University. 
BrookesTalk has functions that mimic sighted 
users' visual scanning of the web such as page 
summarisation, using grammatical techniques to 
provide an abstract about 20% the size of the page; 
keyword lists from a page; and overviews of web 
site structures. It also adapts search engines to 
create lists of 'pure' search results (stripping out ads 
or other extraneous material) which are easy to 
return to. See www.brookes.ac.uk/speech/

A team from the Overbrook School for the Blind in 
Philadelphia will demonstrate classroom 
applications of new techniques for Braille music 
notation including Tack Tiles (TM) Braille code for 
Music Notation and GOODFEEL (TM) Braille 
music transcription software. It says the techniques 
empower blind students to function in music 
classes on a level with their sighted peers, 
providing them an independence from tedious rote 
dictation or tapes which might limit their ability to 
progress.

A new 'virtual touch system' which displays virtual 
graphics through rounded pins on top of a special 
mouse will be on show from Israeli firm VirTouch. 
It provides tactile access to graphics, text, 
education programs, art, photography and tactile 
games, and displays text in regular alphabets as 
well as Braille.

A study of distance learning techniques for blind 
and visually impaired students - who can be 
uniquely disadvantaged by visually-oriented 
distance learning systems such as 
videoconferencing - will be unveiled by the 
University of Northern Colorado. The internet is 
used as a central teaching resource, with a 
standardised navigation shell for the web so 
students do not feel "lost" each time they begin a 
new course; email lists; interactive custom-
designed tutorials; discussion areas; and links to 
external assistive software.
See: http://vision.unco.edu/

NEW, IMPROVED BETSIE

BBC Online, the most popular web service in 
Europe, has released an improved version of 
BETSIE, the web-based system which translates its 
web pages into plain text without frames. The new 
version allows visually impaired users to alter the 
settings however they wish, changing the colour 
scheme or font size for best visibility.

BBC software developer Wayne Myers estimates 
that BETSIE is used to view around half a million 
BBC web pages every month. As well as the blind 
and visually impaired, he says users of BETSIE 
include an ever-growing number of people with 
portable handheld web access devices, who also 
require plain text output.

The BETSIE home page is at:
www.bbc.co.uk/education/betsie/


VISUAL IMPAIRMENT WEB GATEWAY 
PLANNED

The National Library for the Blind is to co-ordinate 
the establishment of a new internet portal - working 
title 'Visugate' - providing access to a wide range of 
digitised information on blindness and visual 
impairment.

The NLB is seeking government funding for the 
project, which will involve the digitisation of 
information not already available in electronic 
formats, as well as links to existing digitised 
information on the web.

SECTION TWO: NEW TECHNOLOGIES
DIGITAL RADIO
************************************

ASTONISHING CLARITY - BUT AT WHAT 
PRICE?

With crystal clear sound, no interference and 
additional services, digital radio - or, as it is 
formally known, Digital Audio Broadcasting - is 
possibly the most significant advance in public 
radio broadcasting since its introduction. However, 
for the blind and partially sighted, there are serious 
concerns with the new developments in the 
medium which has proved their long-term friend 
and often their communications lifeline.

First, to listen to digital transmissions, a new 
receiver will be required. Unlike a simple analogue 
tuner, it contains significant computer circuitry to 
decode the signal and is therefore very expensive. 
For example, the Arcam Alpha 10 digital radio 
tuner, sold as a hi-fi component, costs nearly £800.

Prices will fall as take-up increases - the snowball 
of supply and demand has not yet begun rolling - 
but there are more profound worries. The Digital 
Audio Broadcasting standard includes a data 
channel, which is transmitted alongside the audio 
signal. This works similarly to TV Teletext, and 
radio receivers will contain viewing panels on 
which this information can be displayed.

To an extent, this seems contradictory. Radio with 
visual information - surely that's called television? 
The BBC says not. A spokesperson says: "First, we 
won't broadcast moving pictures, as that takes up 
too much bandwidth. And second, digital radio 
draws on the strengths of radio, which are its 
portability and its intimacy". They are keen to point 
out that the visuals are not a vital semantic 
component: "They enhance, rather than depict the 
audio. You can switch them off or ignore them, and 
still have radio."

The biggest benefit from digital radio is its sound 
clarity. Until the 1990s, advances in radio 
transmission and reception had been steady but 
small. FM (frequency modulation) arrived for a 
clearer, but less robust signal. Stereo emerged, with 
the added spatial definition, but also increased hiss.

With these changes, though, the basic technology 
had not altered significantly - they used analogue 
signals, and the receivers were inexpensive. 
Nevertheless, analogue transmission is wasteful of 
capacity, and prone to signal corruption.

In 1987, the BBC and some private sector consortia 
put together proposals for Digital Audio 
Broadcasting - a digital radio signal essentially 
made up of ones and zeros. In a way, this was radio 
going back to its roots - Morse code, the first 
method of communication using radio waves over 
long distances, was a kind of digital signal. And 
Digital Audio Broadcasting is immune to 
corruption for much the same reason as Morse - all 
that needs to fight through the static is a stream of 
ones and zeros (or dots and dashes) rather than a 
perfect, fluctuating representation of the sound-
wave.

Those who have heard the new system agree it 
produces astonishingly clear sound. More 
importantly there is no interference, even in bad 
weather or while moving. A side-effect to this is 
that, unlike with analogue transmission which fades 
gradually as you move out of range, with digital the 
cut-off point is abrupt: it's everything or nothing.

There are other benefits: because the bandwidth is 
used more efficiently, more stations can fit into the 
spectrum. The BBC plans several, including 
extended news and music services, as does Digital 
One (www.digitalone.co.uk), the UK's first 
commercial digital radio network run as a joint 
venture between GWR, the UK's largest private 
radio group, and cable company ntl.

And then of course there is the possibility of 
parallel transmission of data, alongside the audio 
signal - which brings us back to the danger for 
blind or visually impaired people of losing the 
purity of the medium.

As long as the data panels remain strictly 
supplementary, there is no particular cause for 
concern. But as this 'optional' feature creeps into 
ever-more prominence, perhaps displaying vital 
telephone numbers, web site information and the 
like which, for sighted people, is tedious when 
narrated, it could become more contentious. 
Cinderella radio deserves the clarity of sound and 
the extension of choice, as long as she doesn't in 
the process metamorphose into her more showy 
ugly sister.

SECTION THREE - MOBILE TELEPHONY
WILDFIRE FROM ORANGE
***********************************

YOUR INVISIBLE PERSONAL ASSISTANT

The mobile phone company Orange 
(www.orange.co.uk) is in the process of rolling out 
a new speech recognition service for its phones - 
'Wildfire'.

In fact Wildfire, they would have you believe, is 
more than a service: it is "an intelligent, invisible 
personal assistant" who uses the latest speech 
recognition technology to listen, react and respond 
to your spoken requests.

Furthermore, the service is anthropomorphised - it 
is not an 'it', but a husky-voiced 'she', and the web 
site makes great play of 'her' willingness to obey. 
While this might indulge unreformed (or is it 
unreformable?) male fantasies, it is doubtful that 
many female users will find it quite so endearing. 
Perhaps there should be a choice between a female 
and correspondingly sexy male voice.

The technology is based on the premise that voice 
activation and control is more intuitive and 
convenient than pressing buttons. As such, it has 
great potential value for the blind and partially 
sighted, as it allows one to do virtually anything 
that would have previously required dialling or 
menu-selection from the telephone handset, 
including manage and sort voicemail; phone people 
by name; interrupt a message playback if a call 
comes in; build an address book; and so on.

In an amusing innovation, the commands one uses 
to access the services are colloquial. For example, 
being told there is a message, one is expected to 
reply "What's it say?" However, although one is 
colloquial, one must be precise: and if, for 
example, you ask more primly: "What DOES it 
say?", Wildfire becomes confused, and although 
she tends to get there in the end it could quickly 
become irritating both for the user and for the 
others on the crowded train that is today's surrogate 
office.

Other commands are similar, for example, 'Next 
item' if you want to listen to the next message, or 
'Previous item'. If you forget any of the commands, 
you can ask 'What are my options?' and if you 
change your mind at any time just say 'Never 
mind', and Wildfire will stop what it/she is doing.

Such a sophisticated voice-activated tool might be 
expected to be a great boon for the blind and 
visually impaired, but Kevin Carey, director of the 
technology access charity HumanITy, gives it a 
qualified welcome. "It is a technology going in a 
sensible direction - they're doing all the right 
things, but there are still problems in the way it's 
implemented".

The positive points are that Wildfire is run 
exclusively at the 'server-end' - you phone the 
network, and Wildfire's intelligence resides on a 
remote computer-system. This means that features 
can be added, and yet your phone need not be 
upgraded or customised in any particular way. 
Wildfire is simply a short dial away, rather like 
BT's Callminder system with a sprinkling of extra 
personification and voice-activation.

This strength, however, is in other ways a 
weakness. First, the fact that the service resides on 
the network rather than a chip in one's phone means 
that it costs per minute. The charges vary, but they 
are not insignificant, and so ensure that one's 
relationship with Wildfire must be fleeting and 
snatched. The effort required to spark Wildfire off 
in the first place is significant (and costly) too: 
setting up the address book, like everything else, is 
done online. What's more, learning how to use the 
system in the first place requires a sighted friend to 
read out its manual. Online help is scarce and 
costly.

One way Carey believes the cost and bother of the 
laborious set-up procedure could be minimised is 
by using the Internet. If you could simply import 
your current address books from your PC or 
personal-organiser, via a web page, to Wildfire, it 
would save all the hassle. Orange claims that such 
services are in the pipeline.

Until then, Carey believes the network should give 
some free configuration time. This might lose 
Orange some initial revenue, but it would convince 
more people to be bothered to install the system in 
the first place. When such solutions arrive, when 
Wildfire increases its vocabulary, and when the 
networks upon which it resides implement a more 
flexible phone-tariff to better represent the usage 
patterns of such services, then it may just live up to 
its promise.

One or two other mobile manufacturers are 
producing or are set to produce voice recognition 
services, in a sign that the field is set to take off in 
2000.

Ericsson is to use the new 'Bluetooth' standard for 
wireless data transfer in a new headset for use with 
its phones to be released in the summer. The device 
will allow the user to leave the phone up to 10 
metres away - it could be in another room - to be 
activated and used remotely by speaking into the 
headset using voice recognition.

And Samsung's new SGH 800/810 mobile includes 
a Voice feature which will allow you to dial 
someone's number simply by saying their name, 
use voice commands for the menu controls, and 
record voice memos. Unlike Wildfire, this is a 
handset-resident service, and therefore has the 
opposite advantages and disadvantages to 
Wildfire's server-end system.

SECTION FOUR: WEB ACCESSIBILITY
**************************

UK GOVERNMENT BOOSTS WEB ACCESS

All new UK government internet sites will be 
expected to be accessible to special access software 
used by blind and visually impaired people, and 
existing sites must be made accessible as soon as 
possible, according to new guidelines released by 
the Cabinet Office.

Among the guidelines are that web page 'frames' - 
fixed sections which use a more complicated 
structure - should only be used where there is no 
straightforward alternative. If frames are 
implemented then a 'No frames' alternative must be 
supplied for the entire site and access to it should 
be easily visible on the homepage.

Although compliance is not compulsory, ministers 
will expect swift action to bring sites up to scratch. 
Compliance will be policed by a 'New media team' 
in the Cabinet Office, headed by the e-envoy Alex 
Allan.

The guidelines can be found at:
www.iagchampions.gov.uk/Guidelines/websites/

The RNIB has welcomed the guidelines. 
Campaigns officer Julie Howell said that, while 
few government sites yet comply with the 
guidelines, she was optimistic that this would 
change.

"The government departments I've spoken to are 
worried about the Disability Discrimination Act - 
they don't want to be the first to be sued. Since the 
guidelines were published I've had departments or 
their web site designers ringing me non-stop. They 
are competitive, they all want to be the best".

She said it was also encouraging that she had not 
been hearing excuses from departments about why 
they could not comply with the guidelines, despite 
some of them being fairly tough to meet. "The 
guidelines say all departments have to adhere to the 
accessibility rules unless there is a demonstrable 
reason why they should not. We are keen to hear of 
any such reasons, to enable us to help tackle any 
problems, but so far everyone we've spoken to has 
been fully supportive".

However, Howell admits that the situation outside 
the public sector offers more cause for concern. 
"Business is a different matter. They do not have to 
facilitate services to the public like government. 
Often they say that if they have a phone line 
alongside web information then that is enough to 
cater for blind or visually impaired people, but we 
say that is not enough - web services should be 
accessible".

To help both government and private sector 
companies check their web sites for accessibility, 
the RNIB is looking to assemble a group of blind 
consultants to give sites the once-over. Anyone 
interested in joining this project should contact 
Julie Howell on 0171 391 2191. Readers can also 
use this number to obtain a free copy of the 
RNIB/Web Accessibility Initiative video on 
accessible web site design, 'Web Sites that Work'.

The RNIB will also be looking to be involved in 
the new European 'eEurope - Information society 
for all' project on the information society and 
accessibility (see news, this issue). Its public policy 
team is currently compiling a response to the 
eEurope consultation document, to be submitted 
before the 1 February deadline.
