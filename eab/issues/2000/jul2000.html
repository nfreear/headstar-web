<strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>IBM BIDS FOR VOICE RECOGNITION STANDARD</strong></p>
<p>IBM has stepped up its operations in a highly competitive battle
to create the industry standard for voice recognition technologies,
which are set to experience explosive growth over the next few
years.</p>
<p>The company has launched Websphere Voice Server, which uses its
flagship voice recognition software ViaVoice to 'speech-enable'
e-commerce websites. It says phones including mobile phones will
ultimately outstrip the PC as the primary user interface for
accessing information and conducting transactions.</p>
<p>Using the technology, telephone call centres will be able to
respond to voice commands from customers, and callers will be able
to listen to the same information that is designed for viewing as
text on the web.</p>
<p>IBM is supporting the use of open standards to drive the
widespread adoption of voice technology primarily through Voice
Technology Initiative for Mobile Enterprise Solutions (VoiceTimes).
VoiceTIMES is promoting the use of VoiceXML as the industry
standard mark-up language for voice applications, in the same way
as the web mark-up language HTML is used for visual
applications.</p>
<p>The VoiceXML standard was founded by IBM with AT&amp;T, Lucent
and Motorola. Other members of the VoiceTIMES initiative include
Intel, Dictaphone and Philips.</p>
<p>However, not all observers are convinced of the current
potential for voice recognition to help blind or visually impaired
computer users. A spokesman for the charity AbilityNet, which helps
people with disabilities to use computers, said that although
anything that improved access to websites was welcome, it is almost
never appropriate for visually impaired people to give up keyboard
access.</p>
<p>He also warned there is likely to be intense competition to
create standards for voice recognition, so users should be cautious
before committing to any one system.</p>

<p><strong>MODIFYING THE WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p>Changing font sizes, mouse pointer settings, screen layouts and
file directory listing formats are just some of the tips in
'Modifying the Windows Environment for Visually Impaired Computer
Users', a new book by John Ravenscroft of Edinburgh University and
Kevin Carey, Director of the charity HumanITy and editorial
consultant to E-Access Bulletin.</p>
<p>The book is published by Moray House, price £15.00. Order from

<p><strong>AOL CUTS DEAL WITH FEDERATION OF THE BLIND</strong></p>
<p>The leading online service provider AOL has managed to stave off
legal action by the US National Federation for the Blind, which had
filed a lawsuit late last year charging that AOL's software was
inaccessible and hence violated the Americans with Disabilities
Act.</p>
<p>After a pledge from AOL to make the next version of its
software, AOL 6.0, largely accessible and in particular compatible
with screen reader technologies, NFB agreed to withdraw its suit.
AOL has also posted an accessibility policy onto its web site, and
the two organisations are to work closely together to ensure
accessibility in future.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether AOL's commitment is backed up by
solid action in the long term. Many observers feel that its rather
self-congratulatory accessibility policy - full of vague pledges
about setting up committees and raising employee awareness, but low
on concrete accessibility targets - is worth little in itself.</p>
<p>The NFB has acknowledged as much by retaining the right to renew
its legal claims after a period of one year, if real progress has
not been made. But for now at least, AOL has come back into the
accessibility fold.</p>

<p><strong>TWO AWARDS FOR JOOLY'S JOINT</strong></p>
<p>One of the UK's leading campaigners for the accessibility of web
sites for blind and visually impaired people, Julie Howell, has won
two top awards for her own web site developed as a support
community for people with Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>Howell, who is campaigns officer at the RNIB, won both the
Mirror Reader's Award at this year's Yell UK Web Awards and the
Online Community Award at the New Statesman New Media Awards for
her site Jooly's Joint, at: <a href=

<p><strong>INTERNET-READY BRAILLE NOTE-TAKER LAUNCHED IN
UK</strong></p>
<p>Pulsedata, manufacturer of the first Internet-ready Braille
note-taker BrailleNote, are reporting high levels of interest in
the product following its UK launch in April this year by the Prime
Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark.</p>
<p>As well as taking notes BrailleNote can read documents in grade
1 or 2 Braille, send and receive email, and send and receive email
attachments in Microsoft Word format, among other features. It
costs £2,795 plus VAT for the 18-character refreshable display
version and £3,795 for the 32-character version. For more

<p><strong>OLDER PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE TO LEARN</strong></p>
<p>Only 8% of people over 50 don't think they would be able to
learn how to use a computer, according to a survey by market
researchers BMRB for the charity Age Concern.</p>
<p>Some 38% of people aged 50-64 already use a computer, although
the figure falls to just 11% for people aged over 65.</p>
<p>Lack of interest is the main reason for not using a computer,
cited by 60% of non-users, followed by failure to perceive any use
in it (21%) and cost concerns (17%). Older people who do use
computers spend an average of 9 hours a week on it.</p>

<p><strong>KNOW UK IS A HIT</strong></p>
<p>Know UK, the free online reference service for blind and
visually impaired people launched by the National Library for the
Blind in the spring, has proved a great success, the NLB said this
week.</p>
<p>The service, published by Chadwyck-Healey, covers a wide range
of information sources including Who's Who, Which? Guides, travel
guides like the Good Bed and Breakfast Guide and a National Events
Guide, the Parliamentary report Hansard, the Municipal Year Book,
and other publications. All the publications can be searched
through a single interface.</p>
<p>To gain free access blind and visually impaired people need to
first register as members of the National Library for the Blind,
which is also free. To find out more see: <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: E-DEMOCRACY</strong><br />
<strong>HANSARD SOCIETY REPORT</strong></p>
<p>In recent weeks, the issue of a global 'digital divide' has been
central to the deliberations of the world's most powerful
intergovernmental bodies. The United Nations and the OECD group of
nations have both been pressing the issue, as has the G8 group of
developed nations.</p>
<p>Last week's top-level communiqué from the G8 summit in Okinawa
is on the web at: <a href=
"http://www.g8kyushu-okinawa.go.jp/e/documents/commu.html">http://www.g8kyushu-okinawa.go.jp/e/documents/commu.html</a>
The Okinawa communiqué, in paragraphs 10 and 11, notes: "IT has
immense potential for enabling economies to expand further,
countries to enhance public welfare and promote stronger social
cohesion and thus democracy to flourish. Access to the digital
opportunities must, therefore, be open to all.</p>
<p>"We clearly recognise that the process of globalisation and the
fast pace at which IT is advancing have engendered various
concerns. We need to address such concerns. Acting in concert, we
will maximise the benefits of IT and ensure that they are spread to
those at present with limited access. In this regard, we welcome
contributions from the private sector, such as those of the Global
Digital Divide Initiative of the World Economic Forum and Global
Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce (GBDe).</p>
<p>"In support of these goals . . .we will set up a Digital
Opportunities Task Force (dot force), which will be asked to report
to our next meeting its findings and recommendations on global
action to bridge the international information and knowledge
divide".</p>
<p>So the digital divide, and the related concerns of building an
equitable 'e-democracy' internationally and within nations, is
flavour of the month. After the hype surrounding e-commerce, it
seems governments are finally realising they will have to ensure
that the new global information society being created is not run on
commercial lines alone.</p>
<p>Within the governments of individual countries, the same
realisation is also making itself felt. In the UK, this has meant
the Prime Minister issuing targets to bring all citizens online and
deliver all government services online by 2005; and most other
major government departments have their own initiatives too, like
the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions' £10
million budget for Wired Communities, to bring the benefits of
technology to deprived areas of the UK.</p>
<p>Although the fact is all too rarely mentioned, the digital
divide is by no means simply economic: as well as ensuring that
people with all levels of income have access to online services,
governments must take steps to ensure that all people with
disabilities have the same access as well.</p>
<p>The point was well made at a meeting last week of e-democracy
experts hosted by the Hansard Society for Parliamentary government.
The focus of the meeting was on the use of technology to enhance
the democratic process, and it is in this area above all others
that equal access can be viewed as nothing less than a fundamental
right.</p>
<p>Professor Stephen Coleman, director of the society's digital
media project, told the meeting: "You can't have a democracy
without equal access - without it, the very entity of democracy is
flawed and damaged".</p>
<p>There are three main areas that make up what might be termed the
modern 'e-agenda', Coleman said: e-commerce; e-government, the
provision of public services online; and e-democracy, the
enhancement of the democratic process and public participation.</p>
<p>E-democracy is the Cinderella sister of these three, he said.
"It is most often electronic voting that people talk about when
they mention e-democracy, but actually most people would agree that
we've got the voting system about right already in this country.
But e-democracy is not just about voting: it is about deliberation,
discussion, and the inclusion of all parts of society including
minorities".</p>
<p>The issue of inclusion can itself be broken down into three main
areas, he said. The first is access: who is online, the spread of
technologies like digital television and so on. The second is
accessibility - and this would include issues of accessibility for
the blind and visually impaired, as well as other disabled people,
people with languages other than English, and the ease of
navigation of web sites for all users.</p>
<p>The third is that people must be offered new channels for
democratic participation using new technologies. "There is no point
having the technology unless there are places on the Internet of
democratic significance, for example new channels direct to
Parliament".</p>
<p>On the subject of the inclusion of all parts of society,
delegates at the seminar agreed that it was not just a numbers
game: what mattered most was quality of access and the absence of
discrimination, not the pure statistics of whether a particular
group of people had physical access to the Internet.</p>
<p>Kevin Carey, Director of HumanITy, said there were four main
categories of people with disabilities who faced exclusion from new
technologies, and hence from e-democracy. They were people with
visual problems who encountered problems with poor web
accessibility; people with hearing problems; people with physical
disabilities; and people with functional limitations like learning
difficulties or cognitive problems.</p>
<p>"The fourth category raises the largest problems because we
really don't know what sorts of online service people with
cognitive difficulties need", he said. The problem lies not with
the technology but with the way the way information is made in the
first instance. We could provide information in simpler language
versions for people with different abilities".</p>
<p>The Hansard Society seminar marked the launch of its new report
on E-Democracy, 'New Media and Social Inclusion'. For more

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p><strong>MICROSOFT BACKS DAISY TALKING BOOK STANDARD</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has announced that it will support audio playback for
eBooks - digitised books created using its Microsoft Reader
software - in a move predicted to encourage other companies to make
mainstream products more accessible to the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The company has struck a deal with Labyrinten, a subsidiary
company of the UK adaptive computer specialists Dolphin Computer
Access, and IsSound, which develops products to 'audio-enable'
applications and web devices.</p>
<p>The new format is compatible with the DAISY International
Standard for the production, exchange and use of digital talking
books. The DAISY Consortium - a grouping of nearly 40 libraries and
publishers worldwide - has welcomed the move. DAISY's sole aim is
to persuade companies and organisations to adopt international
standards to help the market in digital talking book (DTB)
technology.</p>
<p>"Microsoft is setting a new standard for inclusiveness in the
eBook industry," said DAISY project manager George Kerscher. "Given
this level of investment in the development of accessibility
guidelines and compatible software, it's conceivable that other
technology and commercial publishing industries may soon follow the
Microsoft lead by offering mainstream products that are immediately
accessible to consumers who are print-disabled."</p>
<p>Microsoft's commitment to the DAISY project does not stop with
its decision to support audio playback for eBooks. In a linked move
the software giant also pledged financial and technical support for
DAISY's on-going campaign to establish global accessibility
standards for digital talking book technology. Microsoft said it
will donate to DAISY 25% of its revenues from the sale of
AudioPublisher for the Microsoft Reader - the tool which enables
publishers to include information within eBooks that enables
synchronised audio narration.</p>
<p>AudioPublisher is the product of a seven year partnership
between the Swedish software company Labyrinten and the US based
isSound who have collaborated to overcome problems in combining
speech, text and images to produce multimedia content. Labyrinten
says that conventional books and e-books can facilitate text and
images without speech and, similarly, analogue tapes can
accommodate speech but not text or images. The new standards can
combine the two formats.</p>
<p>Labyrinten has specialised in digital audio and multimedia
solutions for more than 16 years. IsSound - known to many under its
former name of The Productivity Works, Inc, which it changed in
June - is a developer of software products to sound-enable
applications and web devices, allowing an audio interface to
information to be built into a range of devices including servers,
desktop PCs and mobile phones. The company's range of products
includes the widely-used pwWebSpeak, an audio web browser that
reads web pages aloud, and pwSpeech, a development kit for building
self-voicing applications.</p>
<p>As well as the DAISY standard, IsSound and its new partners are
involved in the work of various other groups which are working to
create open standards for accessible electronic books. These
include the National Information Standards Organization (NISO)
Digital Talking Book Standard and the Open E-Book Forum.</p>
<p>The NISO standard was initiated by the US Library of Congress'
National Library Service in 1997. For web links to all the

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: EMPLOYMENT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>THE WORKBRIDGE PROJECT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RELAUNCHED AGENCY HELPS EMPLOYERS AND
EMPLOYEES</strong></p>
<p>Around 75% of visually impaired people are unemployed and,
according to the Royal London Society for the Blind, at least part
of the blame for this dismaying statistic can be levelled at
employers who are unwilling to adapt working environments.</p>
<p>To help solve the problem the society set up its own job agency
called Workbridge, which helps both job applicants and employers
solve the problems that act as barriers to employment for the
visually impaired.</p>
<p>Recently relaunched by the society with support from Employment
Minister Margaret Hodge, Workbridge has placed dozens of blind and
partially sighted people in a range of jobs including in the IT
industry. "We have placed people who are highly trained in IT who
have come to us with their skills because they were still looking
for appropriate opportunities," says RLSB's Richard Greenwood, who
has been managing the scheme since it started four years ago.</p>
<p>One of the eight people Workbridge has placed since April this
year is information and communications specialist Kelvin Duncan.
Trained in South Africa and with no formal work experience, Duncan
was perhaps at more of a disadvantage than other IT professionals
as his two qualifications were unrecognisable to UK employers. He
approached Workbridge within weeks of arriving in the UK and was
accepted as a voluntary worker for the RLSB itself.</p>
<p>"I went to the interview with my CV and they placed me in a
voluntary position straight away," he says. "I was taken on faith
really because they did not know what I could do."</p>
<p>With this experience he was in a perfect position to
successfully apply for a full-time post with Dorton House School,
the RLSB's school for blind and partially sighted children in
Kent.</p>
<p>IT skills are seen as an essential to the school's aim of
encouraging children to develop their independence and academic
skills, and Duncan describes his role as evaluating equipment and
software for the children at the school and making sure the
networked system runs smoothly. He works alongside an IT teacher
and technicians.</p>
<p>"The children use readers, scanners, low visual aids, the
internet - basically the full range of access technology," says
Duncan. Although he is not a qualified teacher he says he is
frequently involved in a training role.</p>
<p>Duncan says that without the Workbridge scheme he would have
tried using internet job searches and agencies. Instead, after
approaching Workbridge for an interview and working as a volunteer
with RLSB for a few weeks, he found a permanent position within two
months. "As long as I kept my side of the bargain, they did a great
job," he says.</p>
<p>As well as acting as a jobs agency, Workbridge helps job seekers
with application forms, interview preparation and sourcing work
placements. It also has access to a pool of specialist hardware and
software that can be loaned to new employees while they wait for
their own to be made available through the Access to Work scheme.
Workbridge also places people in sponsored placements throughout
the South East as part of the Government backed Supported Placement
Scheme for disabled people.</p>
<p>Workbridge also helps visually impaired people into self
employment. Currently nine people are trading independently after
support from Workbridge, some in the IT sector.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the project offers assistance to employers
to help them recruit and retain visually impaired people. This
service includes advice about employer responsibilities under the
Disability Discrimination Act and advice on adaptive
technology.</p>
<p>"Companies are concerned about what visually impaired people and
adaptive technology will mean for them," says Greenwood.
"Workbridge has helped about 30 companies with access problems
including Pizza Hut, IBM and some NHS trusts."</p>
