TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES RISKING 
PROSECUTION

Technology companies are breaking the law if they 
do not make their products accessible, The British 
Computer Society has warned.

The message was delivered at the society's Access 
for All conference held in London this month, which 
focused on the practical legal and social issues 
arising from the Disability Discrimination Act 
(DDA), which came into force in 1995.

The society said the DDA is having more impact on 
the workplace and the rights of disabled people than 
any previous piece of legislation. The Act applies to 
all companies with more than 15 employees and 
requires that 'reasonable adjustments' must be made 
to working environments to accommodate disabled 
people. "Technology is often the route to enablement 
and is therefore encompassed in the term 'reasonable 
adjustment'," the society said.

The conference was used to publicise the BCS guide 
for employers on this issue – 'The Disability 
Discrimination Act - a practical guide for 
professionals and business managers.'

EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESSES FOR 
POLICY COHERENCE

The European Commission has acknowledged the 
need to strengthen coherence between the many 
different parts of its policy-making machine that 
have a bearing on accessibility issues for people with 
disabilities.

"Because of the inter-relationships across diverse 
policy areas, there is a need for a co-ordinated vision 
and action in the fields of employment, education 
and vocational training, transport, the internal 
market, information society, new technologies and 
consumer policy", a commission statement said.

"Progress in improving access for people with 
disabilities has positive implications for European 
society at large. We are all disabled at some time in 
our lives. A child, a person with a broken leg, a 
parent with a pram or an elderly person are all 
disabled in one way or another. As a matter of fact, 
the needs of people with disabilities coincide with 
the needs of the majority."

The commission this week adopted a framework 
outlining key objectives for the European Union to 
pursue to promote full participation for all Europeans 
living with disabilities. They include a request for 
European standards bodies to determine, in co-
operation with organisations representing the needs 
of elderly and disabled persons, requirements for 
standardisation to ensure accessibility for disabled 
and elderly people within the information society. 

To assist policymakers and help measure progress in 
achieving accessibility, the commission will build a 
comprehensive base of knowledge on disability by 
collecting data on health status, social protection, 
health and safety at work, employment and 
education. An ad hoc module in the European labour 
force survey concerning employment of disabled 
people will be completed in 2002. 

The commission is also to propose to the EU Council 
of Ministers that the year 2003 be declared European 
Year of Disabled Citizens to promote society's 
awareness of disability issues and provide a catalyst 
for the introduction of relevant new policies at all 
levels of government.


GROWTH FOR 'SPEECHMAIL' SPOKEN EMAIL 
SERVICE

More than 70 UK internet service providers have 
adopted the SpeechMail telephone email service 
since its launch in January, the technology's 
manufacturer Vocalis has announced. SpeechMail 
enables people to listen to their messages, reply and 
delete them using simple spoken commands over the 
phone.

The procedure is made secure by the use of 
individual user account numbers and PINs. Once 
identified, the automatic system tells users who new 
messages are from, what the subject is and when it 
was sent. Subscribers can then choose to play, reply 
to, or delete a message, all using spoken commands.

SpeechMail also records voice replies of up to a 
minute in length and sends these as sound file 
attachments which recipients can hear by clicking on 
the file in their mail reader. SpeechMail subscribers 
can listen directly to recorded replies from other 
subscribers.

Apart from access to a phone, users do not need any 
special equipment. However, subscriptions cost 
£2.99 per month and telephone calls to the service 
are charged at standard national rates. For details see:
www.speechmail.co.uk


THE INTERNET ON A DISK

Internet-on-a-Disk is a free electronic newsletter 
which is much prized by blind internet users. It 
reports on new electronic texts posted online which 
are free of extraneous material and hence of great use 
to blind people as well as the business and education 
sectors.

Published by the independent book publisher B&R 
Samizdat Express, the newsletter includes coverage 
of new electronic texts posted to the awesome 
Gutenberg project, the famous volunteer-driven 
initiative to transcribe copyright-free books into 
digital format. Gutenberg has already made about 
2,500 texts available for free online including classic 
works of literature.

VOLUNTEER COMPUTER HELPERS WANTED

The RNIB is looking for experienced computer users 
throughout the UK to volunteer to help visually 
impaired and blind people get started with a new 
computer or solve technical problems. Volunteers 
will be able to decide how much time they want to 
devote to the project, and no specific expertise on 
technology for the blind is necessary as all volunteers 
will be given technical backup.

It is expected that volunteers will largely be able to 
help over the telephone, but visits to users' homes 
may also be necessary. Potential helpers should call 
0845 604 2341 or e-mail tcsvolunit@rnib.org.uk

SECTION TWO:
ACCESSIBLE GAMING
************************************

MOSEYING ON DOWN TO GRIZZLY GULCH

Most computer games depend on special graphics 
and fast-changing visual prompts, making them next 
to useless for the blind and visually impaired. But 
Grizzly Gulch, launched last month, is different.

The game, as one might guess, is set in a virtual Wild 
West. Players mosey round the eponymous 
imaginary town, gamble on card games, buy items 
from the general store and, of course, get involved in 
quick-draw gun fights against outlaws. Like most 
interactive computer games Grizzly Gulch allows 
players to adopt a character which they then use to 
explore a computer-generated world full of surprises 
and dangers, in a complex plot which changes 
depending on decisions made during the game.

So why is Grizzly Gulch different? "Absolutely no 
vision is required to play this game," say its makers 
Bavisoft (www.bavisoft.com). "It's like nothing 
you've experienced before - a game you have to hear 
to believe".

Bavisoft was established this year, and is dedicated 
to creating superior quality software for the blind and 
visually impaired. Grizzly Gulch is the company's 
flagship product and reflects a mushrooming interest 
in blind gaming in the US, where the visually 
impaired have access to a growing number of games 
produced by both professionals and amateur 
programmers.

The gaming frenzy in the States does not appear to 
be reflected in the UK, however. The RNIB's 
Technology Information Service has only had a few 
enquiries about computer games, and developers 
dedicated to blind gaming in this country are hard to 
find.

Even so, dozens of computer games for the visually 
impaired are listed on the US website Disability 
Specialtys (www.disabilityspecialtys.com) – a 
website staffed by, and run for, the visually impaired 
and people with other disabilities.

Among those catalogued include Destination Mars, 
which involves navigating a spaceship, and Run for 
President, in which you must outwit your computer 
in a virtual election for the White House. Gamers 
may also seek the mythical Excalibur in Arthur's 
Quest, enter the world of Star Trek or play a simple 
version of Monopoly.

Two of the most advanced games available pitch 
players into situations where they have to use a series 
of non-visual clues and prompts to solve complex 
problems. The advanced submarine simulation game 
Lone Wolf requires good compass skills, while Haze 
Maze players are challenged to navigate themselves 
through mazes using the changing sound of 
footprints and other audible clues.

While conventional designers have used 2-D or 3-D 
graphics and sound to build games, those 
programmed for the blind and visually impaired 
usually depend entirely on audible prompts and 
speech.

Bavisoft have used more than 1,000 digitally 
recorded sound effects for Grizzly Gulch. Original 
music is used, with professional voice recordings for 
the characters and 'full stereo environments' for each 
of the many locations. Users can also access a fully 
audible help facility.

Although Grizzly Gulch is well-produced and has 
received good reviews it is also among the most 
expensive games at around 50 US Dollars. To play 
you must also have a DirectX compatible stereo 
sound card and speakers, and indeed it is essential 
before buying any games online to carefully check 
the minimum system requirements.

At the other end of the spectrum there are a multitude 
of simpler games that are available free or for very 
little. Robert Betz is the brains behind the Florida-
based Accessible Games 
(www.gamesfortheblind.com) and he is committed to 
producing simple, easy to play games at a reasonable 
price. "I am blind myself, so I know the financial 
burdens many blind people experience. For this 
reason, I only charge 10 US Dollars for each game," 
he says.

"I spend a great deal of time writing help files for all 
my games. A user should be able to read the help file 
one time, and know everything they need to know 
about the game." One of his games is Accessible 
Battleship, which is based on a simple grid. As the 
player move from cell to cell the grid co-ordinates 
are spoken by their screen reader - in this case 
Battleship is compatible with JAWS for Windows. A 
combination of sound effects and spoken feedback 
are used to inform the player the result of each 'shot'. 
Launched just two months ago, Accessible Games 
now offers seven games including BlackJack and 
Yahtzee.

Other US companies in this market include Personal 
Computer Systems (www.pcsgames.com) which is 
operated and maintained by blind programmers. 
They plan to launch two new games this year, PCS 
Space Invaders which is a reaction game based on 
audible signals, and Snipe Hunt.

ESP Softworks (www.espsoftworks.com) produces 
several highly complex games for the blind and 
visually impaired. The company has just launched 
Shell Shock, an artillery-style command game that 
can be played by two players. Others scheduled for 
release this year include The Genesis Project which 
sounds more like a role playing adventure game and 
'Battle Chess' which has still to be officially named. 
The company says Battle Chess is "a cross between 
the classic game of Chess and the bone-crushing 
spirit of Doom". Game on.

* In future issues, E-Access Bulletin will be taking a 
look at role-playing games and educational games 
for the visually impaired.

SECTION THREE - ANALYSIS
EUROPEAN POLICY
***********************************

A NEW ERA OF ACCESSIBILITY IN EUROPE?
- by Kevin Carey, Director, HumanITy

The arrival of the Disability Rights Commission at 
the same time as the imminent incorporation of the 
European Convention on Human Rights into UK law 
is a happy coincidence. It might be somewhat 
grandiose to term it the beginning of a new era, but 
this is certainly an opportune moment.

'E-Europe', the European Union's initiative on e-
commerce and a fair information society, is picking 
up speed and we are about to enter the era of mass-
market digital television and web-enabled phones. If 
we do not get our accessibility messages across now, 
we may miss out for a whole technological 
generation, saddled yet again with the trauma and 
costs of retro-engineering and indifferent 
compatibility.

Even now, reference to accessibility often amounts to 
little more than tokenism - at the E-Europe Meeting 
in Lisbon on 10-11 April, for example, one 
rapporteur ended his presentation with the sentence: 
". . . and, of course, we discussed social exclusion". 
There are signs, however, that in spite of the 
somewhat abstract and tenuous character of rights 
declarations, access is finally becoming an important 
issue in Europe.

The Lisbon meeting had been called to construct an 
action plan for the rapid implementation of E-
Europe, following on from a special meeting of 
heads of state, and it will be ratified at a European 
summit in June. One of the initiative's 10 target areas 
was the inclusion of disabled people and although 
user representation was poor, some headway was 
made, particularly as the RNIB was strongly 
represented. 

The sessions on disability tended to revolve around 
rather abstract ideas such as "raising public 
awareness", "avoiding the fragmentation of 
standards", "improving standards in education and 
employment" and "establishing codes of practice and 
benchmarking". Given the rights framework, I had to 
overcome my resentment at a debate which 
considered whether or not disabled people should be 
'included', and if so, how far and how fast in order to 
get discussion into much more concrete areas. All the 
abstraction is a means to an end, after all, so we 
came up with five priority areas for action on access: 
health information; library access; broadcasting; 
banking and financial services and mass retail.

The first two of these five areas are public services 
which all citizens pay for through a combination of 
local tax, VAT, income and other taxes; the last two 
are vital sectors where profitability is high; and 
broadcasting is a mix of public provision (paid for by 
a licence fee with a minute concession for blindness) 
and profitable private enterprise. It crossed my mind 
at the time that my income tax form was 
inaccessible! Still, the topic is now on the main EU 
agenda and we strongly recommended that disability 
access should not be in a separate box but should be 
integrated across the whole E-Europe agenda.

Meanwhile, the UK's Cabinet Office has been 
looking into standards for digital television, 
particularly as they might be implemented for the 
broadcasting of government information and the 
facilitation of interactive services such as form-
filling and voting. There will be a section in the next 
draft on disability access, largely generated as the 
result of the web accessibility guidelines for 
government web sites adopted by the government in 
December 1999.

The situation in respect of Third Generation mobile 
phones is less promising because there is much less 
regulation in this area than there is in broadcasting, 
and as technological convergence advances, it may 
be impossible to define where largely deregulated 
telecommunications and publishing stop and well-
regulated broadcasting starts.

There are three major lessons to be drawn from 
recent experience. The first is that lobbying will have 
to be diversified from its UK government focus to 
the EU, to standard-setting bodies (if you can find 
them), and to industry. Secondly, there will need to 
be a pan-disability dimension which makes alliances 
with all kinds of groups which are classified or 
classify themselves as part of the "social exclusion" 
remit. Finally, this necessarily more complex process 
will have to be undertaken ever more rapidly which 
will entail a hard look at the resources we deploy for 
lobbying and at our client consultation procedures; 
fewer committees and more networks; fewer binding 
resolutions and more trust.

SECTION FOUR - 
GLOBAL ONLINE DEBATE
***********************************

GOVERNMENTS MUST LEAD ACCESSIBILITY 
BY EXAMPLE

Governments and intergovernmental bodies have a 
key role to play in ensuring the design of technology 
products is accessible to all parts of society, 
according to the newly-published report of the global 
online think-tank Boosting the Net Economy 2000.

However a direct legislative approach is not the best 
way forward, according to think-tank member 
Professor Elsa Rosenblad of the Chalmers University 
of Technology, Sweden. "I don't think it is successful 
to force any kind of technical development", 
Professor Rosenblad said. "But I can see two ways of 
reaching the same goal. One is enforcement using 
standards, the other is research to create new 
knowledge of the user's situation.

"International Standards Organisation standards, 
especially ISO 9241 and ISO 9355 regarding 
ergonomic requirements, could be used for control, 
criteria and evaluation of products at governmental 
and other greater purchases. That would bring 
forward a development of measurable accessibility. 
Only products that would meet these criteria could 
then be considered for large-scale purchases.

"But probably a more successful way of achieving 
products that are accessible to all would be 
governmental investment in new research into the 
user's situation. Lack of knowledge on the part of the 
designer of the cognitive and physical abilities of the 
individual user is a severe problem.

"Accessibility problems do not exist because 
companies don't want to solve them, but because 
they have not got the knowledge to do it. They are 
used to working with their customers - the purchasers 
- but not with the individual end-users. Accessibility 
is determined by a knowledge of the users' goals and 
handling capacities, their values and benefits of the 
use and the context of use. If this knowledge was 
available, much better products would reach the 
market."

Yong-Suk Lee of the National Computerization 
Agency, Republic of Korea, said there was a need for 
governments to distinguish the citizen from the 
consumer. "We all wear different hats. one as a 
citizen, one as a consumer. Appropriate policies for 
the citizen may be different from appropriate policies 
for the consumer, and citizens' rights may be 
different from consumers' rights.

"When governments are making policies, it is 
important to make this distinction. For example, 
when we want companies to make products for the 
disabled, the logic for the policy would not come 
from the consumer area but from the citizen area. In 
other words, this probably has little to do with 
consumer protection but involves protecting the 
quality of life for all citizens, or the basic rights of 
citizens - thereby justifying the strongest of 
government interventions."

Cynthia Waddell of the City Manager's Department, 
City of San Jose, US, said that unless accessibility 
components are built into the design of web sites and 
networks, significant populations may be locked out 
as the web rapidly advances from a text-based 
communication format to a graphical format 
embracing audio and video clip tools.

"Yet, we have learned that the benefits of accessible 
web design extend beyond the community of people 
with disabilities. Consumers operating cell phones, 
personal digital assistants and information appliances 
can readily reach the content of the web because 
accessible web design separates the content from the 
presentation. Most importantly, however, accessible 
web design enables low technology to access high 
technology. Consumers with slow modems and low 
bandwidth can access the web even if they do not 
have state-of-the-art technology.

"The past month has brought significant 
breakthroughs in the area of industry consensus in 
accessibility. For example, the over 400 members of 
the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3c.org) 
have reached consensus on not only web authoring 
tool accessibility features but also user agent 
accessibility features.

"Governments must also adopt accessible web design 
policies and implementation steps. From August all 
US federal government web sites and higher 
education institutions will have to incorporate 
accessible web design by law. In fact, US federal 
contracting officers for web design sites and services 
will be personally liable if they do not procure 
products or services that have accessibility 
components.

"This new federal law also requires that a business 
losing a bid for a federal contract can challenge the 
awarding of that contract if the business can 
demonstrate that their product or service exceeds the 
accessibility features of the business that won the 
contract. The business incentive seeks to reward 
those businesses who have devoted research and 
development on accessibility."

The online debate spanned more than 40 nations in 
all continents and was hosted by the publisher of E-
Access Bulletin, Headstar, with backing from Bull 
Information Systems. The full report of the debate is
