<p><strong>EU MOVES TO ENSURE INCLUSIVE</strong><br />
<strong>INFORMATION SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission has launched a major new initiative -
'eEurope' - aimed at creating a socially inclusive information
society, including a proposed new mandatory requirement for all
government and other public service internet sites to be made
accessible to the special access software used by blind and
visually impaired people.</p>
<p>The move coincides with the Portugese Presidency of the EU - no
coincidence, as Portugal is the first European country where web
accessibility is already law. 'eEurope' focuses on ten priority
areas, aimed at bringing every citizen online; creating a digitally
literate Europe; and ensuring that the whole process is socially
inclusive. Priority Seven is 'eParticipation for the disabled'.</p>
<p>Targets on accessibility, released for consultation,
include:</p>
<p>"By the end of 2000: The Commission and member states should
review the relevant legislation and standards programmes dealing
with the information society, with a view to ensuring their
conformity with accessibility principles. The Commission will
[also] propose a recommendation to member states to take account of
the requirements of people with disabilities in the procurement of
information and communications products and services.</p>
<p>"By the end of 2001: The Commission and member states should
commit themselves to making the design and content of all public
web sites accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>"By the end of 2002: The Commission will support the creation of
a network of centres of excellence, at least one in each member
state, that will develop a European curriculum module in
Design-for-All to train designers and engineers."</p>

From here, one can access the eEurope consultation document -
ironically available in Adobe pdf file only, not the most
accessible of formats.</p>
<p>The Portugese internet accessibility group, PASIG, has set up an
eEurope-People With Disabilities discussion group. You can find out

<p><strong>COUNTDOWN TO CSUN</strong></p>
<p>The countdown has begun to this year's vast annual 'Technologies
and persons with disabilities' conference at the California State
University Center on Disabilities, more commonly known as CSUN, to
be held on March 20-25.</p>
<p>Among the many new technologies on display will be BrookesTalk,
a specially adapted web browser for the blind and visually impaired
developed by the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at
Oxford Brookes University. BrookesTalk has functions that mimic
sighted users' visual scanning of the web such as page
summarisation, using grammatical techniques to provide an abstract
about 20% the size of the page; keyword lists from a page; and
overviews of web site structures. It also adapts search engines to
create lists of 'pure' search results (stripping out ads or other
extraneous material) which are easy to return to. See <a href=
"http://www.brookes.ac.uk/speech/">www.brookes.ac.uk/speech/</a></p>
<p>A team from the Overbrook School for the Blind in Philadelphia
will demonstrate classroom applications of new techniques for
Braille music notation including Tack Tiles (TM) Braille code for
Music Notation and GOODFEEL (TM) Braille music transcription
software. It says the techniques empower blind students to function
in music classes on a level with their sighted peers, providing
them an independence from tedious rote dictation or tapes which
might limit their ability to progress.</p>
<p>A new 'virtual touch system' which displays virtual graphics
through rounded pins on top of a special mouse will be on show from
Israeli firm VirTouch. It provides tactile access to graphics,
text, education programs, art, photography and tactile games, and
displays text in regular alphabets as well as Braille.</p>
<p>A study of distance learning techniques for blind and visually
impaired students - who can be uniquely disadvantaged by
visually-oriented distance learning systems such as<br />
videoconferencing - will be unveiled by the University of Northern
Colorado. The internet is used as a central teaching resource, with
a standardised navigation shell for the web so students do not feel
"lost" each time they begin a new course; email lists; interactive
customdesigned tutorials; discussion areas; and links to external
assistive software.<br />

<p><strong>NEW, IMPROVED BETSIE</strong></p>
<p>BBC Online, the most popular web service in Europe, has released
an improved version of BETSIE, the web-based system which
translates its web pages into plain text without frames. The new
version allows visually impaired users to alter the settings
however they wish, changing the colour scheme or font size for best
visibility.</p>
<p>BBC software developer Wayne Myers estimates that BETSIE is used
to view around half a million BBC web pages every month. As well as
the blind and visually impaired, he says users of BETSIE include an
ever-growing number of people with portable handheld web access
devices, who also require plain text output.</p>

<p><strong>VISUAL IMPAIRMENT WEB GATEWAY</strong><br />
<strong>PLANNED</strong></p>
<p>The National Library for the Blind is to co-ordinate the
establishment of a new internet portal - working title 'Visugate' -
providing access to a wide range of digitised information on
blindness and visual impairment.</p>
<p>The NLB is seeking government funding for the project, which
will involve the digitisation of information not already available
in electronic formats, as well as links to existing digitised
information on the web.</p>

<strong>SECTION TWO: NEW TECHNOLOGIES</strong><br />
<strong>DIGITAL RADIO</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>ASTONISHING CLARITY - BUT AT WHAT</strong><br />
<strong>PRICE?</strong></p>
<p>With crystal clear sound, no interference and additional
services, digital radio - or, as it is formally known, Digital
Audio Broadcasting - is possibly the most significant advance in
public radio broadcasting since its introduction. However, for the
blind and partially sighted, there are serious concerns with the
new developments in the medium which has proved their long-term
friend and often their communications lifeline.</p>
<p>First, to listen to digital transmissions, a new receiver will
be required. Unlike a simple analogue tuner, it contains
significant computer circuitry to decode the signal and is
therefore very expensive. For example, the Arcam Alpha 10 digital
radio tuner, sold as a hi-fi component, costs nearly £800.</p>
<p>Prices will fall as take-up increases - the snowball of supply
and demand has not yet begun rolling - but there are more profound
worries. The Digital Audio Broadcasting standard includes a data
channel, which is transmitted alongside the audio signal. This
works similarly to TV Teletext, and radio receivers will contain
viewing panels on which this information can be displayed.</p>
<p>To an extent, this seems contradictory. Radio with visual
information - surely that's called television? The BBC says not. A
spokesperson says: "First, we won't broadcast moving pictures, as
that takes up too much bandwidth. And second, digital radio draws
on the strengths of radio, which are its portability and its
intimacy". They are keen to point out that the visuals are not a
vital semantic component: "They enhance, rather than depict the
audio. You can switch them off or ignore them, and still have
radio."</p>
<p>The biggest benefit from digital radio is its sound clarity.
Until the 1990s, advances in radio transmission and reception had
been steady but small. FM (frequency modulation) arrived for a
clearer, but less robust signal. Stereo emerged, with the added
spatial definition, but also increased hiss.</p>
<p>With these changes, though, the basic technology had not altered
significantly - they used analogue signals, and the receivers were
inexpensive. Nevertheless, analogue transmission is wasteful of
capacity, and prone to signal corruption.</p>
<p>In 1987, the BBC and some private sector consortia put together
proposals for Digital Audio Broadcasting - a digital radio signal
essentially made up of ones and zeros. In a way, this was radio
going back to its roots - Morse code, the first method of
communication using radio waves over long distances, was a kind of
digital signal. And Digital Audio Broadcasting is immune to
corruption for much the same reason as Morse - all that needs to
fight through the static is a stream of ones and zeros (or dots and
dashes) rather than a perfect, fluctuating representation of the
soundwave.</p>
<p>Those who have heard the new system agree it produces
astonishingly clear sound. More importantly there is no
interference, even in bad weather or while moving. A side-effect to
this is that, unlike with analogue transmission which fades
gradually as you move out of range, with digital the cut-off point
is abrupt: it's everything or nothing.</p>
<p>There are other benefits: because the bandwidth is used more
efficiently, more stations can fit into the spectrum. The BBC plans
several, including extended news and music services, as does
Digital One (<a href=
"http://www.digitalone.co.uk/">www.digitalone.co.uk</a>), the UK's
first commercial digital radio network run as a joint venture
between GWR, the UK's largest private radio group, and cable
company ntl.</p>
<p>And then of course there is the possibility of parallel
transmission of data, alongside the audio signal - which brings us
back to the danger for blind or visually impaired people of losing
the purity of the medium.</p>
<p>As long as the data panels remain strictly supplementary, there
is no particular cause for concern. But as this 'optional' feature
creeps into ever-more prominence, perhaps displaying vital
telephone numbers, web site information and the like which, for
sighted people, is tedious when narrated, it could become more
contentious. Cinderella radio deserves the clarity of sound and the
extension of choice, as long as she doesn't in the process
metamorphose into her more showy ugly sister.</p>

<strong>SECTION THREE - MOBILE TELEPHONY</strong><br />
<strong>WILDFIRE FROM ORANGE</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>YOUR INVISIBLE PERSONAL ASSISTANT</strong></p>
<p>The mobile phone company Orange<br />
(<a href="http://www.orange.co.uk/">www.orange.co.uk</a>) is in the
process of rolling out a new speech recognition service for its
phones - 'Wildfire'.</p>
<p>In fact Wildfire, they would have you believe, is more than a
service: it is "an intelligent, invisible personal assistant" who
uses the latest speech recognition technology to listen, react and
respond to your spoken requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the service is anthropomorphised - it is not an
'it', but a husky-voiced 'she', and the web site makes great play
of 'her' willingness to obey. While this might indulge unreformed
(or is it unreformable?) male fantasies, it is doubtful that many
female users will find it quite so endearing. Perhaps there should
be a choice between a female and correspondingly sexy male
voice.</p>
<p>The technology is based on the premise that voice activation and
control is more intuitive and convenient than pressing buttons. As
such, it has great potential value for the blind and partially
sighted, as it allows one to do virtually anything that would have
previously required dialling or menu-selection from the telephone
handset, including manage and sort voicemail; phone people by name;
interrupt a message playback if a call comes in; build an address
book; and so on.</p>
<p>In an amusing innovation, the commands one uses to access the
services are colloquial. For example, being told there is a
message, one is expected to reply "What's it say?" However,
although one is colloquial, one must be precise: and if, for
example, you ask more primly: "What DOES it say?", Wildfire becomes
confused, and although she tends to get there in the end it could
quickly become irritating both for the user and for the others on
the crowded train that is today's surrogate office.</p>
<p>Other commands are similar, for example, 'Next item' if you want
to listen to the next message, or 'Previous item'. If you forget
any of the commands, you can ask 'What are my options?' and if you
change your mind at any time just say 'Never mind', and Wildfire
will stop what it/she is doing.</p>
<p>Such a sophisticated voice-activated tool might be expected to
be a great boon for the blind and visually impaired, but Kevin
Carey, director of the technology access charity HumanITy, gives it
a qualified welcome. "It is a technology going in a sensible
direction - they're doing all the right things, but there are still
problems in the way it's implemented".</p>
<p>The positive points are that Wildfire is run exclusively at the
'server-end' - you phone the network, and Wildfire's intelligence
resides on a remote computer-system. This means that features can
be added, and yet your phone need not be upgraded or customised in
any particular way. Wildfire is simply a short dial away, rather
like BT's Callminder system with a sprinkling of extra
personification and voice-activation.</p>
<p>This strength, however, is in other ways a weakness. First, the
fact that the service resides on the network rather than a chip in
one's phone means that it costs per minute. The charges vary, but
they are not insignificant, and so ensure that one's relationship
with Wildfire must be fleeting and snatched. The effort required to
spark Wildfire off in the first place is significant (and costly)
too: setting up the address book, like everything else, is done
online. What's more, learning how to use the system in the first
place requires a sighted friend to read out its manual. Online help
is scarce and costly.</p>
<p>One way Carey believes the cost and bother of the laborious
set-up procedure could be minimised is by using the Internet. If
you could simply import your current address books from your PC or
personal-organiser, via a web page, to Wildfire, it would save all
the hassle. Orange claims that such services are in the
pipeline.</p>
<p>Until then, Carey believes the network should give some free
configuration time. This might lose Orange some initial revenue,
but it would convince more people to be bothered to install the
system in the first place. When such solutions arrive, when
Wildfire increases its vocabulary, and when the networks upon which
it resides implement a more flexible phone-tariff to better
represent the usage patterns of such services, then it may just
live up to its promise.</p>
<p>One or two other mobile manufacturers are producing or are set
to produce voice recognition services, in a sign that the field is
set to take off in 2000.</p>
<p>Ericsson is to use the new 'Bluetooth' standard for wireless
data transfer in a new headset for use with its phones to be
released in the summer. The device will allow the user to leave the
phone up to 10 metres away - it could be in another room - to be
activated and used remotely by speaking into the headset using
voice recognition.</p>
<p>And Samsung's new SGH 800/810 mobile includes a Voice feature
which will allow you to dial someone's number simply by saying
their name, use voice commands for the menu controls, and record
voice memos. Unlike Wildfire, this is a handset-resident service,
and therefore has the opposite advantages and disadvantages to
Wildfire's server-end system.</p>

<strong>SECTION FOUR: WEB ACCESSIBILITY</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>UK GOVERNMENT BOOSTS WEB ACCESS</strong></p>
<p>All new UK government internet sites will be expected to be
accessible to special access software used by blind and visually
impaired people, and existing sites must be made accessible as soon
as possible, according to new guidelines released by the Cabinet
Office.</p>
<p>Among the guidelines are that web page 'frames' - fixed sections
which use a more complicated structure - should only be used where
there is no straightforward alternative. If frames are implemented
then a 'No frames' alternative must be supplied for the entire site
and access to it should be easily visible on the homepage.</p>
<p>Although compliance is not compulsory, ministers will expect
swift action to bring sites up to scratch. Compliance will be
policed by a 'New media team' in the Cabinet Office, headed by the
e-envoy Alex Allan.</p>
<p>The guidelines can be found at:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.iagchampions.gov.uk/Guidelines/websites/">www.iagchampions.gov.uk/Guidelines/websites/</a></p>
<p>The RNIB has welcomed the guidelines.<br />
Campaigns officer Julie Howell said that, while few government
sites yet comply with the guidelines, she was optimistic that this
would change.</p>
<p>"The government departments I've spoken to are worried about the
Disability Discrimination Act - they don't want to be the first to
be sued. Since the guidelines were published I've had departments
or their web site designers ringing me non-stop. They are
competitive, they all want to be the best".</p>
<p>She said it was also encouraging that she had not been hearing
excuses from departments about why they could not comply with the
guidelines, despite some of them being fairly tough to meet. "The
guidelines say all departments have to adhere to the accessibility
rules unless there is a demonstrable reason why they should not. We
are keen to hear of any such reasons, to enable us to help tackle
any problems, but so far everyone we've spoken to has been fully
supportive".</p>
<p>However, Howell admits that the situation outside the public
sector offers more cause for concern. "Business is a different
matter. They do not have to facilitate services to the public like
government. Often they say that if they have a phone line alongside
web information then that is enough to cater for blind or visually
impaired people, but we say that is not enough - web services
should be accessible".</p>
<p>To help both government and private sector companies check their
web sites for accessibility, the RNIB is looking to assemble a
group of blind consultants to give sites the once-over. Anyone
interested in joining this project should contact Julie Howell on
0171 391 2191. Readers can also use this number to obtain a free
copy of the RNIB/Web Accessibility Initiative video on accessible
web site design, 'Web Sites that Work'.</p>
<p>The RNIB will also be looking to be involved in the new European
'eEurope - Information society for all' project on the information
society and accessibility (see news, this issue). Its public policy
team is currently compiling a response to the eEurope consultation
document, to be submitted before the 1 February deadline.</p>
