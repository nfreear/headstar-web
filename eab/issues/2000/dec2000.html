<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>'INTERNET-READY CAR' IS</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESSIBILITY SPIN-OFF.</strong></p>
<p>Text-to-speech technology developed to help blind people access
the Internet is behind an innovative new device for sighted people
- an 'Internet-ready car' that allows drivers to access the net.
The move highlights what advocates of inclusive design have been
saying for years � that simple, accessible technology benefits
everyone, not just people with visual or other impairments.</p>
<p>The prototype 'Bunnymobile' has been<br />
developed by web usability specialists Bunnyfoot. It is a 1999
Volkswagen New Beetle convertible, fitted with a notebook computer
and a GSM mobile phone. An<br />
Internet connection is made using software developed by Bunnyfoot
to emulate the main types of speech browser already used by blind
people to surf the Internet.</p>
<p>The result allows drivers to listen to information online while
keeping their eyes on the road. Dr Jon Dodd, Technical<br />
Director at Bunnyfoot said: "When web sites are designed to be
usable by blind people they also work in 'eyes busy' situations,
such as driving a car. We found that web sites which have been
designed following accessible web design guidelines worked really
well in our web-enabled car, but sites which did not follow these
guidelines could not be heard."</p>
<p>Julie Howell, RNIB's Accessible Internet Campaigns Officer, was
one of the first people to go for a spin in the Bunnymobile. "When
Bunnyfoot contacted me, I wondered how technology used by blind
people would help people driving cars! But I was able to hear
gardening tips from Bob Flowerdew on the BBC Online site and
listened to the latest financial news on ft.com without taking my
eyes off the road. I could even pick up my email."</p>

<p><strong>CERTIFICATION FOR ACCESS</strong><br />
<strong>TECHNOLOGY TRAINERS.</strong></p>
<p>A new certification scheme for people who train others to use
access technology is to be piloted in January by the British
Computer Association of the Blind (BCAB).</p>
<p>Steve Plumpton of BCAB told the RNIB's 'Techshare' technology
access conference earlier this month that the association has
received many calls from people<br />
complaining about access technology advice and training.</p>
<p>The BCAB Trainer Certification Scheme is an attempt to raise
standards in this area using a three-part test for trainers
comprised of a delivery skills refresher course lasting 3- 5 days;
written coursework; and a product competency test. Separate tests
will have to be passed for each piece of access<br />
technology for which the trainer wishes to be certified.</p>
<p>As products are updated, new courses and certificates will be
created, Plumpton said. It is also important that the scheme
is<br />
promoted not only to the trainers but to the customers themselves,
he said, so they are aware that there is a required standard for
their training.</p>
<p>A second pilot will be run in March, and it is hoped that the
course will go live around Easter time. Further information about
the scheme will appear in January at the BCAB web site:<br />

<p><strong>GRABBING WEB PAGES OVER THE</strong><br />
<strong>PHONE.</strong></p>
<p>The UK's first comprehensive phoneactivated<br />
voice internet service,<br />
BrowseByPhone, was launched this month by UK-based wireless
Internet specialists Waperture (<a href=
"http://www.waperture.com">http://www.waperture.com</a>).</p>
<p>BrowseByPhone allows telephone users to access Internet content
by voice and a telephone keypad. The launch service � called
GataGrab - lets people use the<br />
BrowseByPhone website to tell the system which pages on the web
they are interested in. At any time thereafter they can dial an
access number, key in a 'grab code', and hear the page they are
interested in being read back to them, live off the Internet.</p>
<p>Waperture says it is keen to investigate further applications
for the visually<br />
impaired. Once the service is established in the UK, the company
wants to expand into the US and Europe, and plans to release a
number of different voice services including conventional portal
services such as sports, news and weather, and the ability for
users to build their own voice sites and services.</p>
<p>The service uses 'SpeecHTML' technology from Vocalis. Many UK
Internet Service Providers already use Vocalis 'SpeechMail'
technology (<a href=
"http://www.speechmail.co.uk">http://www.speechmail.co.uk</a>) to
allow people to listen to their email messages, reply and delete
them using<br />
spoken messages over the phone (see EAccess<br />
Bulletin, May 2000).</p>
<p>The BrowseByPhone service can be<br />
accessed via the Internet from<br />
<a href="http://www.wapgata.com">http://www.wapgata.com</a>
or<br />
<a href=
"http://www.browsebyphone.com">http://www.browsebyphone.com</a></p>
<p>However, when E-Access Bulletin tried to test it some gremlins
were evident. Dialling the test number produced the message:<br />
'Welcome to GataGrab at BrowseByPhone. Please enter the Grab Code
for the page you want to access or press zero for the main browse
portal'. When a zero was keyed, the same message was played, ad
infinitum.</p>
<p><strong>CALLING ALL UPSTARTS.</strong></p>
<p>Budding social entrepreneurs are being invited to bid for a pot
of 50,000 UK Pounds to help launch up to three projects designed to
help a local community, in the first 'UpStart Awards'.</p>
<p>The awards are being hosted by New<br />
Statesman magazine, with sponsorship from Centrica plc and further
input from UNLTD, the first UK foundation for social<br />
entrepreneurs (<a href=
"http://www.unltd.org.uk">http://www.unltd.org.uk</a>).</p>
<p>Those accepting an award must be prepared to commit to their
project full-time. The entry period runs to May 2001, and details
can be found at the BOBBY-compliant<br />
UpStart web site:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.upstarts.org.uk">http://www.upstarts.org.uk</a></p>
<p>The site will also act as an ongoing<br />
information resource for social<br />
entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>BRAILLE VOYAGER BREAKS NEW</strong><br />
<strong>GROUND.</strong></p>
<p>A new refreshable Braille computer display from German group
Tieman claims to<br />
innovate in a number of ways.</p>
<p>It is extremely lightweight (1.2 kg), and connects to a computer
via the USB<br />
(Universal Serial Bus) port, from which it also takes its power.
Low power Braille cells use just 5 per cent of a laptop computer's
battery output.</p>
<p>The display can also be used to pass<br />
commands back to the computer, controlling mainstream software
applications over the Braille display. A further piece of 'Tiemans
Express' software allows the construction of sequences of commands,
or 'macros', that can be run with a single keystroke.</p>
<p>The Braille Voyager's UK distributor is Concept Systems.
See:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.conceptsystems.net/">http://www.conceptsystems.net/</a></p>
<p><strong>MICROSOFT AND PULSEDATA</strong><br />
<strong>COLLABORATE.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft and Pulse Data International have announced their
collaboration to develop an e-book reader for the blind and
visually impaired.</p>
<p>Microsoft Reader software will be integrated with Pulse Data's
BrailleNote family of screenless personal data assistants that
offer feedback through speech and electronic Braille (<a href=
"http://www.braillenote.com/">http://www.braillenote.com/</a>).</p>
<p>To read an electronic book with BrailleNote, users will need to
download an e-Book title from an online distributor to their<br />
BrailleNote device, then open the file. They will have the option
to listen to the speech version of the e-Book or read the
electronic Braille display.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: CONFERENCE REPORT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TECHSHARE.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TALKING BOOKS SET TO ENTER THE</strong><br />
<strong>MAINSTREAM.</strong></p>
<p>Talking books are about to enter the<br />
mainstream, delegates heard at the RNIB's recent 'Techshare'
conference on how<br />
technology can help blind and partially sighted people in everyday
situations like shopping, banking and in the workplace.</p>
<p>Peter Osborne, UK Network and<br />
International Development Manager at the RNIB, said the new 'Open
eBook' standard for digital talking books<br />
(<a href="http://www.openebook.org">http://www.openebook.org</a>)
includes<br />
accessible multimedia data (see also EAccess Bulletin, July and
September issues).</p>
<p>This standard has grown out of various others including the
DAISY standard. There are various portable hardware readers that
are available to read this data.</p>
<p>Digital books are faster and cheaper to access than printed
material. They are also searchable, portable and include active
information by using hyperlinks.</p>
<p>John Worsfold of Dolphin Computer Access said it was important
that a single standard should emerge for eBooks, and he hoped Open
eBook would become that standard, since it has already been adopted
for current or future use by more than 150 publishers.</p>
<p>He said eBook users could not only access the content they want
but even add<br />
information such as audio or text notes. Another key feature of
eBooks is that the voice that reads it is not a synthesised voice,
Worsfold said.</p>
<p>But there are some potential problems that can be identified as
well. These include copyright protection, file format issues,
accessibility, usability and a problem with small screens on some
hand-held devices.</p>
<p>There are tools available to create eBooks from various formats.
For example, 'TIPS' software can take analogue recordings and
create a structured eBook; 'WIPS' can<br />
change digital WAV files into an eBook; and 'TOPS' can change
eBooks into analogue recordings.</p>
<p>This variety means there will become a blurring between media
and users will be able to get precisely what they want through
mainstream publishers, Worsfold said.</p>
<p>The conference also heard of a similar flexibility in publishing
media which can arise from the use of the 'meta-language' XML
(Extensible Markup Language).</p>
<p>Dave Pawson, Business Process<br />
Improvement Facilitator at the RNIB, said XML is a way of
describing document or application content so it can be used across
a range of delivery platforms like the web, mobile telephony and
digital TV. XML can include digital signature information so the
user can be sure the information is secure and is from the right
source.</p>
<p>Pawson said that in the RNIB's Technical Consumer Services
Division there are<br />
currently 10 magazines being produced in five media. So it seemed
sensible to create them in XML, and then use transformation tools
to export them into the other formats.</p>
<p>This process was tested initially using the departmental monthly
briefing that goes out as Braille, HTML and print. The trials have
been useful, although a few problems<br />
remain, namely: XML has a steeper learning curve than HTML; Word
2000 does not<br />
export good XML; and approximately 5%<br />
intervention is still needed to complete a document in a specific
new format after exporting it from XML.</p>
<p>Also on the agenda at Techshare was how technology is assisting
blind and partially sighted people to travel within and use the
built environment.</p>
<p>A number of projects within the RNIB's Joint Mobility Unit have
combined design advice and the introduction of assistive technology
to help blind and partially sighted people. Projects have combined
the use of colour contrast, good design practice and tactile,
audible and visual signage.</p>
<p>Gill Whitney, Principal Researcher at the RNIB's Join Mobility
Unit, spoke about way-finding aids � remotely-triggered<br />
speaking signs - for those people who cannot use a cane or a guide
dog. There are<br />
currently two main types of these aids, RNIB React and
Infravoice.</p>
<p>RNIB React is a wall-mounted unit triggered by a credit-card
sized radio transmitter or 'module'. It can detect ambient noise
and increase the sound level when required to combat it, for
example when a train comes into a platform.</p>
<p>It is possible to input up to eight different messages into the
unit, and these can be in different languages as well. After<br />
installation, the messages and configuration of the unit can be
modified by plugging a laptop computer into it.</p>
<p>RNIB React units cost £1,300 each, and the modules cost £25,
although the latter are usually distributed free of charge or
loaned out. Some shops purchase their own units, so users are aware
of the entrance to their shop. The system has been installed in
Leeds City Centre and Golders Green High Street and Bus Station in
London.</p>
<p>The Infravoice system operates by<br />
transmitting an infrared signal. It is a unit that has infrared
beams pointed in four directions. This can be stand-mounted or
mounted in a dome-shaped unit on the<br />
ceiling, looking rather like a CCTV unit. Its configuration can be
changed in much the same way as the React system, using a<br />
laptop.</p>
<p>The Infravoice unit costs £690 and the receiver £230. Units have
been installed in various shopping centres including<br />
Kingfisher, Bluewater, Cribbs Causeway, Touchwood and Chimes, and
the receivers are loaned out through shopmobility.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: CASE STUDY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'LOOK'.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF</strong><br />
<strong>FAMILY SUPPORT.</strong></p>
<p>The National Federation of Families with Visually Impaired
Children, more usually known under its snappier title of 'LOOK', is
placing the web at the heart of its family support activities
following the success of its first, volunteer-built site.</p>
<p>LOOK provides information and support to families with visually
impaired children. It already has 35 regional support groups in the
UK, but intends to set up many more to achieve its aim of better
support and<br />
awareness for affected families nationwide.</p>
<p>The centre of the organisation helps the regional groups
fund-raise and train<br />
volunteers, as well as providing legal advice through a network of
links to top education lawyers. The charity links newcomers to
other families with similar problems, and also helps set up
Specific Eye Disorder groups.</p>
<p>The LOOK web site was initially created in March 2000. At first
it consisted merely of an online version of its quarterly
newsletter, as an experiment to see if a full-blown site would be
well received.</p>
<p>Then along came Gareth Wait, a volunteer with two partially
sighted children, both of whom have been helped by LOOK. By
way<br />
of thanks, he offered to use his Internet skills to design and
build a fully accessible site, and he is now the organisation's
webmaster.</p>
<p>"Before he made contact with us, Gareth had had some rather dire
experiences with the specialists at his local hospital, where he
was being fed medical babble", says LOOK<br />
Development Director Jennifer Bowen. "As he was an old-hand at all
things webby, he did not find it too difficult to pinpoint the
information he required on the net. He then decided to simplify the
process of finding information on vision-related topics.</p>
<p>"The LOOK site became more of a resource, and, while still very
much in its infancy, the reception for it has been terrific. We are
currently working on a huge new links<br />
section, with all sites fully described and categorised."</p>
<p>The charity regards its web operation is a key part of its new
focus</p>
<p>Last year a 'Youth LOOK' Project was<br />
created after young people complained that the organisation needed
a stronger youth presence. "We want them to be at the centre of the
organisation," says Ms Bowen. "We aim to train a core of 'older'
young people to lead weekends and forums, and would<br />
eventually like the whole charity to be run by them and their
families."</p>
<p>This year, the organisation has also led the development of the
first national user-led research programme into the effects of
visual impairment on children and their families. In a major new
study, a team of researchers are looking at the effects of the
disability on the child and family, and the type and amount of
support families receive from health and educational services. They
will also talk to professionals about issues of access, policy and
funding.</p>
<p>LOOK Development Director Jennifer<br />
Bowen says: "Many of us have had to<br />
struggle with doctors who ignore us,<br />
teachers who assume visually-impaired<br />
children's abilities are limited and social workers who have no
idea what help is<br />
available. And however knowledgeable<br />
professionals are in health, education or social care, it is the
way they work together and with families that will shape the<br />
effectiveness of their care and the quality of people's lives."</p>
<p>LOOK wants its Internet activities to sit alongside its youth
work, keeping all<br />
interested parties abreast of developments. In particular an email
list has been set up using the free 'Listbot' service so anyone can
enter their email address, hit the button and register to be kept
informed of developments by email.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the charity wants to spin off the 'Youth
LOOK' section of its web site into an entire sub-site in its own
right, with online services and information aimed at children and
young people.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: ONLINE LEARNING</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>THE 'JOB' PROJECT.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONSORTIUM SEEKS FUNDING FOR</strong><br />
<strong>NEW 'VIRTUAL COLLEGE'.</strong></p>
<p>A consortium of UK academic and voluntary bodies is seeking
European funding to<br />
expand a virtual learning and mentoring project to help blind and
visually impaired people gain employment.</p>
<p>The consortium � led by Learn Net, an<br />
online training organisation � has already completed the first
phase of its 'JOB' project, which assisted physically disabled
people. Although it was originally intended to include blind people
in this work from the outset, it proved too expensive to make the
'virtual college' software interface fully accessible as part of
phase one.</p>
<p>JOB was funded under a European<br />
employment programme for disadvantaged groups known as GATE, but
this has now been replaced by a new programme dubbed EQUAL which
has a slightly broader focus. The consortium are therefore looking
at other possibilities for European funding such as the LEONARDO
training programme, for which the next round of bids are due in
January 2001.</p>
<p>The new project will retain the essentials of JOB, which allowed
people to link from their homes via a personal computer to a
'virtual college' complete with tutors and online mentors.</p>
<p>Learn Net tutor Ruth Garner says: "Access to a learning
environment is often<br />
problematic for people with disabilities - crowds and communal
areas may be offputting<br />
for many. Fluctuations in mental or<br />
physical health mean that people may miss classes, disrupted
learning may lead to a person with disabilities dropping out and
not achieving their goals.</p>
<p>"Attendance at a virtual college means students can take as long
as they want to contribute to discussions - often more effectively,
as time enables a more<br />
considered response. Thus people experience real freedom within a
virtual college because they are not being physically observed.
There is more equality of opportunity than in a physical
classroom."</p>
<p>Blind people stand to benefit a lot from inclusion in the second
phase project, Garner says: "We did have one user in the first
phase who was partially sighted, and she enjoyed the experience
because she could mix with the other students freely online and
nobody knew she couldn't see".</p>
<p>The JOB project started in January 1998. People who were
recruited for JOB were loaned a computer, onto which was installed
a virtual college interface with a study area, library, common room
and evaluation room.</p>
<p>Virtual mentors were an important part of the programme. They
'sat' in the virtual common room (from which tutors and<br />
managers were excluded) and informally mixed with the learners to
pick up issues and offer support, either within the group or
individually through email. This meant issues could be picked up
early and tackled before they became insurmountable. In<br />
addition, when a face-to-face meeting was needed by the learner, a
mentor was sent out to work with them in their own home.</p>
<p>"'We originally decided that mentors were important because
working remotely was potentially isolating for the learner", Ms
Garner says. "What really happened though was that learners were
not isolated at all, because they could make contact with others
when they wanted to, 24-hours a day.</p>
<p>"Another concern was that we would be<br />
isolating people with disabilities, but what we found was that
people had more contact with others than they had before the
started the course. They really enjoyed meeting other people
through the computer."</p>
<p>Over the 15 week period, learners worked in groups of
approximately 10 people. Each week an activity was set by the tutor
and learners were asked to discuss this between them. The virtual
college allowed people to work when they wanted to while still
being able to join in a threaded bulletin board discussion.</p>
<p>Garner says Learn-Net is seeking new<br />
partners to take its work forward, and would be keen to hear from
any group in the visual impairment community which might be able to
offer funding or other assistance to help develop the next phase of
the virtual college work. Interested parties can contact her on
