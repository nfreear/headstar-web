<p><strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong></p>
<p><strong>OLYMPICS COMMITTEE FACES LEGAL</strong><br />
<strong>ACTION OVER INACCESSIBLE WEB SITE</strong></p>
<p>The organisers of the Olympic Games in Sydney face legal action
on two fronts for failing to make their web site accessible to
blind people, with both individual and class actions a possibility
after the games close this weekend, EAccess Bulletin has
learned.</p>
<p>The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
has already lost an Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission hearing held last year after a discrimination complaint
was lodged by Bruce Maguire, who is blind. However despite having a
year since then to make the site fully accessible, SOCOG refused,
saying the process would be too expensive and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Some changes have been made to the site, with 'alt-text' tags
being added to some images and text links added to image maps.
However, Maguire says that not all images have been texttagged, and
other problems persist, such as the accessibility of the Olympics
results tables.</p>
<p>Although the commission ruling is not legally binding, Maguire
told E-Access Bulletin this week that as soon as the games are over
he will seek a further hearing to win damages under Australia's
Disability Discrimination Act, and seek enforcement in Australia's
Federal Court if SOCOG refuse to comply. There is also a
possibility that a class action will be brought against SOCOG by
blind people in Australia, he said.</p>
<p>Also under fire is IBM, which designed the site for SOCOG. IBM
gave evidence in the initial hearing that the site would take 368
days to fix at a cost of two million US Dollars, although Maguire
successfully called two expert witnesses to assert that the true
cost of fixing it would be 30,000 Dollars, and that it would take
just 2-4 weeks.</p>
<p>" I don't think of myself as an activist, in that I don't go
looking for inaccessibility", he said. "However, if I encounter it
in the course of my daily life, I do feel that I have some
responsibility to try and overcome it.</p>
<p>"In general, I believe that accessibility can best be achieved
through dialogue, education and consensus-building: however,
disability discrimination legislation is useful when these
processes fail, and as part of the ongoing task of creating a
culture of respect for the principles of access and equity".</p>

<p><strong>BATTLE IS JOINED FOR E-BOOKS</strong><br />
<strong>STANDARD</strong></p>
<p>Software giants Microsoft and Adobe Systems have made new moves
in their battle to create a dominant standard for 'e-books' �
digitised book software and hardware.</p>
<p>Microsoft has announced a partnership with leading online
bookshop Amazon.com to create a customised versions of its
Microsoft Reader ebook software, allowing Internet users to buy and
download e-books from the bookshop. The deal was announced
at:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/PressPass/press/2000/">http://www.microsoft.com/PressPass/press/2000/</a>
Aug00/AmazonPR.asp</p>
<p>Amazon does not actually sell e-books yet, although it plans to
in the near future. However Barnes and Noble<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.barnesandnoble.com">http://www.barnesandnoble.com</a>),
another major online bookshop, is leading the way in this field and
already offers e-books for purchase and download in three different
formats: Microsoft Reader, Glassbook (<a href=
"http://www.glassbook.com">http://www.glassbook.com</a>) and Rocket
eBook (<a href=
"http://www.rocketebook">http://www.rocketebook</a>.<br />
com/).</p>
<p>Microsoft hopes to overtake the other two formats by dint of its
general market dominance with Windows PCs. Rocket eBook is a<br />
proprietary system, produced by 1997 start-up company NuvoMedia,
while Glassbook has recently been acquired by Adobe Systems, as
part of its bid to rival Microsoft by enhancing its own e-book
system based on its Portable Document Format (pdf) software.</p>
<p>Glassbook's latest software (and indeed Microsoft Reader as
well) includes text-tospeech capabilities, text annotation
and<br />
highlighting with electronic sticky notes, searching and text
enhancement facilities that are intended to make content easier to
read. See: <a href=
"http://www.glassbook.com/news/pr082800.htm">http://www.glassbook.com/news/pr082800.htm</a></p>
<p>The e-books market is new but potentially lucrative. E-books
have obvious advantages for blind and visually impaired people, as
they can usually be readily converted into speech or Braille, but
they are predicted to increase in popularity across a range of
users as e-book readers become more portable and offer quick,
mobile access to large libraries of books.</p>

basics � digital books'.
<p><strong>NEW BREED OF ADOBE PDF FILES EASIER</strong><br />
<strong>TO NAVIGATE</strong></p>
<p>In a separate development, Adobe has stated that the new version
of its Acrobat Reader software for Portable Document Format (pdf)
files will be accessible to screen readers. Past versions of pdf
have been widely attacked for their<br />
inaccessibility, with their reliance on graphical layouts rather
than plain text.</p>
<p>According to a report in Federal Computer Week - which was
posted up by Adobe on its<br />
accessibility site last month and hence implicitly endorsed � the
new Acrobat Reader due next spring and its associated new pdf file
creation tools will incorporate easy text navigation into
documents, whatever their length or graphical layout.</p>
<p>The system will work best with new files but may also help make
old pdf files more accessible to screen reader. The report can be
accessed from:<br />

<p><strong>'VISUGATE' BUILDS WEB OF</strong><br />
<strong>INFORMATION PARTNERS</strong></p>
<p>The 'Visugate' project to create an accessible online gateway to
a huge range of existing and newly digitised resources on visual
impairment has already signed up 20 partner organisations to
provide information through the service.</p>
<p>The 20 include RNIB's Research Library; Action for Blind People;
The British Journal of Visual Impairment; the International Centre
for Eye Health; the Department of Education at University of
Birmingham and BT Soundings. Other partners are now being
approached, and the National Library for the Blind, which is
overseeing the project, says there is no limit to the potential
number of organisations that can become involved.</p>
<p>The NLB is conducting a survey of potential Visugate users to
ask them what resources and functionality they would like to see
included in the service. For more information contact Joanna
Widdows on <a href=

<p><strong>EUROPEAN COMMISSION TARGETS</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission is to place<br />
information society accessibility issues at the heart of of its
annual 'IST' information society technologies conference in Nice,
France from 6- 8 November.</p>
<p>The 'Information society for all' conference will build on the
commission's recent 'eEurope' policy proposals with an
'e-participation' track that will focus on three areas: European
government and democracy; e-health; and the active participation
and integration of all, especially people with disabilities and
older adults.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: EDUCATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BOOKS BY CD-ROM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FROM READING TREE TO INTERACTIVE</strong><br />
<strong>CD � A LABOUR OF LOVE</strong></p>
<p>A specialist schoolteacher from Croydon has just completed a
two-year labour of love to create a nationwide CD-ROM book service
for<br />
schoolchildren with visual impairments.</p>
<p>Val Lawson, who teaches visually impaired children for Croydon
Local Education Authority (LEA), found that her pupil's needs were
not being met by existing services. She told EAccess Bulletin:
"Many disabled children are<br />
now in mainstream schools, and making the curriculum accessible is
a huge issue. Lots of young people with visual impairment also have
other physical disabilities, which means they may have trouble
holding a book or turning the pages, as well as reading text and
pictures. Many of these children with are being taught in
mainstream classes by teachers with no specialised experience.</p>
<p>"The Oxford Reading Tree - which is the main programme for
teaching young children to read in 80 per cent of primary schools -
does have tape and Braille versions, but this is not necessarily
the most suitable format for visually impaired or disabled
students."</p>
<p>Having decided to take action herself to address the lack or
resources, Ms Lawson started out producing popular, illustrated
books in CD format with digitised text, illustrations that were
simplified and enhanced for visually impaired children, audio
navigation tools and other accessibility features. Originally,
books selected by children and teachers were modified on request,
but the new versions were proving so popular that she decided to
pilot materials from a pre-existing structured reading programme -
the reading tree - and make them available for loan.</p>
<p>"This was a difficult time, because these pilot materials were
not of sufficiently high quality for general release", she says. "I
had managed to get permission from Oxford University Press to use
their material, and had generated lots of interest from local
education authorities, but I just didn't have time during the day
to do the work. So I upgraded my home computer and started<br />
working on the project at home."</p>
<p>Ms Lawson started by modifying every book illustration to remove
backgrounds and enhance colour and definition.</p>
<p>"The big breakthrough came when I discovered Adobe Acrobat
software," she says. "I found that by producing a menu system with
links to and from various files, I could not only make an
easy-to-use electronic format, but also compress the material so
that all 112 books in the reading tree could fit on to one CD. The
project then took on a life of its own and consumed mine for two
years."</p>
<p>With little financial or technical support, Ms Lawson found the
main cost was replacing and upgrading all her home equipment, as
her PC did not have the memory to deal with complex graphic
manipulation.</p>
<p>She also managed to get some help from a US software company,
Fileopen systems<br />
(<a href="http://www.fileopen.com/">http://www.fileopen.com/</a>),
in the form of a free copy of the company's 2,500 US Dollar
security package. This protects all the files from unauthorised
access, ensuring copyright cannot be breached.</p>
<p>"Given the restricted market, I knew I was going to have to set
quite a high price for the CD to recoup some of my costs, but I was
worried that educational services might not be able to afford it",
she says. "So I decided to offer a master copy, printable version,
to my local education authority for them to distribute to other
visually impaired services on a non-profit making basis, and was
delighted when they offered not only to distribute it free, but
also to help with publicity."</p>
<p>There are two versions of the CD. The first has a licence to
print one copy built into the installation code, and has been
restricted to a specific audience because of copyright limitations.
The second version works solely on screen.</p>
<p>"The screen version was a total act of faith on my part," says
Ms Lawson. "The first child who tried to use it was a six year old
girl with central vision loss. She thought it was wonderful. She
found the display easy to read, loved the pictures and mastered the
navigation system in minutes. She then spent about 45 minutes
showing off her reading and IT skills to everyone else in the
room!"</p>
<p>The screen-only version has layout in a landscape format which
fills the entire screen. Menu navigation is supported by speech and
may be driven by touch-screen if required. The menu links have
voice-overs, activated by the mouse when it enters the menu zone. A
click of the mouse turns each page, and the final screen allows a
choice of reading the story again, or finishing and returning to
the main menu.</p>
<p>Ms Lawson is looking for feedback from other people using the
CD. For further information visit her website at:<br />

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: WEB ACCESSIBILITY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>INTERNET SHOPPING</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HIGH STREET CHAINS MAKE POOR</strong><br />
<strong>PROGRESS ON WEB DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>By rights, Internet shopping should be a Godsend for blind and
partially sighted people, allowing them to browse and buy whatever
they want without having to negotiate crowded shops and public
transport.</p>
<p>But a report just published by the Royal National Institute for
the Blind shows the truth is somewhat different: blind people are
in fact being excluded from the e-shopping revolution through lazy
web design and ignorance on the part of site owners. What is more
the culprits � major high street names among them � could be
rendering themselves liable to prosecution under the Disability
Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>Julie Howell, resident web accessibility expert at the RNIB and
the report's author, says: 'The Act requires that all service
providers should make information about their companies and
services accessible for blind or partially-sighted people. Even our
biggest high street stores are clearly not doing this.</p>
<p>"It's not just a question of legality, these businesses are
losing a potential 8.5 million disabled customers too."</p>
<p>The RNIB first investigated the web sites of 17 major high
street stores and banks last year, so companies have had 12 months
to get their act together. The 17 were Abbey National, Alliance and
Leicester, Asda, Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, HSBC, Marks and
Spencer, NatWest, Pizza Hut, Pizza Express, Post Office, Safeway,
Sainsburys, Somerfield, Tesco and WH Smith.</p>
<p>The new report follows up on the original findings, and
pronounces the results 'extremely disappointing'. All the companies
failed to measure up in at least one of five different test
categories used, and some failed in all five.</p>
<p>The test categories were:<br />
1. Is the web site text legible, with strong visual contrast?<br />
2. Does every image have a text tag, which can be converted to
speech description?<br />
3. Are alternatives offered to framed sites? 4. Is the site
available in HTML, as opposed to image, pdf or other formats?<br />
5. Do all pages pass the 'Bobby' test � the standard software
package which tests for accessibility? (see <a href=
"http://www.cast.org/bobby">http://www.cast.org/bobby</a>)</p>
<p>"All three high street banks we visited failed the test, even
though banking is supposed to be a universally essential service",
says Howell. "Online supermarkets also performed<br />
particularly badly. The only company which did reasonably well was
Marks and Spencer."</p>
<p>One case study described in the report is that of Peter, who is
blind and has been using the internet for three years using a PC
and JAWS screen reader. Peter heard about the Debenhams summer sale
on TV, and tried subsequently to log onto the store's web site.</p>
<p>"What a disappointment", he said. "I wanted to check the
availability of men's shirts, but I kept hearing 'unsupported
script'. It was really confusing. I did find some information
eventually, but it took me so long to work my way past the
nonsense, it would probably have been quicker to go to the
store."</p>
<p>Another disabled user, Caroline, was asked to try out the
Safeway website and do some home grocery shopping. She uses a PW
Webspeak browser. She said: "It would really help me if heavy
things like cat food could be delivered to my home. I think I'm
quite good with the internet, but I found the Safeway site a real
struggle. I kept hearing 'image, image' and didn't know what was
going on. I just gave up in the end."</p>
<p>The Abbey National site failed all five tests, because it was
designed in Macromedia Flash, with no HTML alternative. A spokesman
told EAB that the company was now working on an HTML site which
would be fully accessible. Pizza Hut and Abbey National are also
working on new, accessible sites.</p>
<p>Ms Howell said: "Poor or careless coding of HTML and complex
screen designs are the most common problems, but most of the
companies we tested are now trying to address this in response to
the report."</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: BACK TO BASICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DIGITAL BOOKS AND OTHER TEXTS</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the ways in which the Internet is proving a liberating
resource for blind and visually impaired people is as a repository
of electronic texts. For the first time, a wide range of books,
newspapers, journals, periodicals and articles are available
online, 24-hours a day, to be accessed at the reader's
convenience.</p>
<p>Combined with email services and computer disks or CD-ROMs with
digitised texts send through the post, the result � thanks to
special access software like text-to-speech - is access for the
first time by blind people to the information they want, when they
want it. No more waiting for others to transcribe it to Braille or
read it aloud: no more restriction to the information, or extracts
from the information, that others arbitrarily decide is of most
interest.</p>
<p>The vast majority of digital texts available online are in ASCII
(plain text) format, and can thus be read by any computer whether
PC or Mac, DOS or Windows. The following is a round-up of digitised
plain text resources on the Internet and in other media.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT GUTENBERG</strong></p>
<p>The awesome Gutenberg project is a volunteerdriven initiative to
transcribe copyright-free books into digital format. Gutenberg has
already made about 2,500 texts available for free online including
classic works of literature.</p>
<p>The books are entered onto a database in 'plain vanilla ASCII' �
the plainest of plain text formats, with for example italics,
underlines and bolds all represented by capital letters.</p>
<p>Project Gutenberg has the goal of turning two million
conventional books (mostly titles already out of copyright) into
electronic texts freely available on the internet. The site
includes several easy ways of finding a book: by title, author,
subject or even by other details including language, version or
author's birth-date. Once you have located a title, it can be
downloaded onto your computer to read offline at your leisure.</p>
<p>Visit the site at <a href=
"http://www.gutenberg.net/">http://www.gutenberg.net/</a> and click
on "E-Text Listings" to obtain a full listing of all titles
available, or "search" to search on any of the criteria mentioned
above. This site, however, was not designed with visual<br />
impairment in mind and some people may not find it easy to read or
screen-reader-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>NATIONAL LIBRARY FOR THE BLIND</strong></p>
<p>The NLB site, designed for easy access by those with a
visual-impairment and found at<br />
<a href="http://www.nlbuk.org/">www.nlbuk.org</a>, is a good source
of electronic texts and contains some valuable areas such as 'Where
can I get ideas about new books to read?' and 'The Fiction Cafe
(Books for young people)'.</p>
<p><strong>THE INTERNET PUBLIC LIBRARY</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a href=
"http://www.ipl.org/reading/books/">http://www.ipl.org/reading/books/</a>
for another very useful resource of electronic texts arranged in 10
easy-to-browse categories including languages, natural sciences and
mathematics, the arts and literature and rhetoric.</p>
<p>Although the site is not written with visual impairment in mind,
no frames or side-menus mean that it is quite accessible.</p>
<p><strong>THE ONLINE BOOKS PAGE</strong></p>
<p>This site at<br />
<a href=
"http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/lists.html">http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/lists.html</a>
is an index of more than 12,000 English works which are available
free of charge and as full texts on the Internet. The service is
part of the Digital Library Project of the University of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>THE TALKING NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION</strong><br />
<strong>OF THE UK</strong></p>
<p>The TNAUK site at <a href=
"http://www.tnauk.org.uk/">http://www.tnauk.org.uk/</a> offers
access to more than 200 titles on tape, disk, e-mail or

Pounds a year. Texts available include daily newspapers and weekly
magazines, as well as other monthly and quarterly publications. A
full listing of all their publications in all formats is available
on the website or by telephone on 01435 866102.</p>

<p><strong>THE DAISY CONSORTIUM</strong></p>
<p>The next generation of talking books will be based on electronic
formats. These special CDs will be played on e-book readers or on
computers with the correct player software.</p>
<p>E-books that conform to the 'DAISY'<br />
consortium standard can combine a digital recording of a human
voice reading the book with the text of the book in electronic
form. The two can interact so that it is easy to move through the
book by chapter, page, sub-headings or even to search for phrases
or single words, from which point the spoken playback can instantly
continue.</p>
