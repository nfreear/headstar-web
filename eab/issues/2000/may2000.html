<strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES RISKING</strong><br />
<strong>PROSECUTION</strong></p>
<p>Technology companies are breaking the law if they do not make
their products accessible, The British Computer Society has
warned.</p>
<p>The message was delivered at the society's Access for All
conference held in London this month, which focused on the
practical legal and social issues arising from the Disability
Discrimination Act (DDA), which came into force in 1995.</p>
<p>The society said the DDA is having more impact on the workplace
and the rights of disabled people than any previous piece of
legislation. The Act applies to all companies with more than 15
employees and requires that 'reasonable adjustments' must be made
to working environments to accommodate disabled people. "Technology
is often the route to enablement and is therefore encompassed in
the term 'reasonable adjustment'," the society said.</p>
<p>The conference was used to publicise the BCS guide for employers
on this issue � 'The Disability Discrimination Act - a practical
guide for professionals and business managers.'</p>

<p><strong>EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESSES FOR</strong><br />
<strong>POLICY COHERENCE</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged the need to strengthen
coherence between the many different parts of its policy-making
machine that have a bearing on accessibility issues for people with
disabilities.</p>
<p>"Because of the inter-relationships across diverse policy areas,
there is a need for a co-ordinated vision and action in the fields
of employment, education and vocational training, transport, the
internal market, information society, new technologies and consumer
policy", a commission statement said.</p>
<p>"Progress in improving access for people with disabilities has
positive implications for European society at large. We are all
disabled at some time in our lives. A child, a person with a broken
leg, a parent with a pram or an elderly person are all disabled in
one way or another. As a matter of fact, the needs of people with
disabilities coincide with the needs of the majority."</p>
<p>The commission this week adopted a framework outlining key
objectives for the European Union to pursue to promote full
participation for all Europeans living with disabilities. They
include a request for European standards bodies to determine, in
cooperation with organisations representing the needs of elderly
and disabled persons, requirements for standardisation to ensure
accessibility for disabled and elderly people within the
information society.</p>
<p>To assist policymakers and help measure progress in achieving
accessibility, the commission will build a comprehensive base of
knowledge on disability by collecting data on health status, social
protection, health and safety at work, employment and education. An
ad hoc module in the European labour force survey concerning
employment of disabled people will be completed in 2002.</p>
<p>The commission is also to propose to the EU Council of Ministers
that the year 2003 be declared European Year of Disabled Citizens
to promote society's awareness of disability issues and provide a
catalyst for the introduction of relevant new policies at all
levels of government.</p>
<p><strong>GROWTH FOR 'SPEECHMAIL' SPOKEN EMAIL</strong><br />
<strong>SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>More than 70 UK internet service providers have adopted the
SpeechMail telephone email service since its launch in January, the
technology's manufacturer Vocalis has announced. SpeechMail enables
people to listen to their messages, reply and delete them using
simple spoken commands over the phone.</p>
<p>The procedure is made secure by the use of individual user
account numbers and PINs. Once identified, the automatic system
tells users who new messages are from, what the subject is and when
it was sent. Subscribers can then choose to play, reply to, or
delete a message, all using spoken commands.</p>
<p>SpeechMail also records voice replies of up to a minute in
length and sends these as sound file attachments which recipients
can hear by clicking on the file in their mail reader. SpeechMail
subscribers can listen directly to recorded replies from other
subscribers.</p>
<p>Apart from access to a phone, users do not need any special
equipment. However, subscriptions cost £2.99 per month and
telephone calls to the service are charged at standard national
rates. For details see: <a href=
"http://www.speechmail.co.uk/">www.speechmail.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>THE INTERNET ON A DISK</strong></p>
<p>Internet-on-a-Disk is a free electronic newsletter which is much
prized by blind internet users. It reports on new electronic texts
posted online which are free of extraneous material and hence of
great use to blind people as well as the business and education
sectors.</p>
<p>Published by the independent book publisher B&amp;R Samizdat
Express, the newsletter includes coverage of new electronic texts
posted to the awesome Gutenberg project, the famous
volunteer-driven initiative to transcribe copyright-free books into
digital format. Gutenberg has already made about 2,500 texts
available for free online including classic works of
literature.</p>

<p><strong>VOLUNTEER COMPUTER HELPERS WANTED</strong></p>
<p>The RNIB is looking for experienced computer users throughout
the UK to volunteer to help visually impaired and blind people get
started with a new computer or solve technical problems. Volunteers
will be able to decide how much time they want to devote to the
project, and no specific expertise on technology for the blind is
necessary as all volunteers will be given technical backup.</p>
<p>It is expected that volunteers will largely be able to help over
the telephone, but visits to users' homes may also be necessary.
Potential helpers should call 0845 604 2341 or e-mail <a href=

<strong>SECTION TWO:</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESSIBLE GAMING</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>MOSEYING ON DOWN TO GRIZZLY GULCH</strong></p>
<p>Most computer games depend on special graphics and fast-changing
visual prompts, making them next to useless for the blind and
visually impaired. But Grizzly Gulch, launched last month, is
different.</p>
<p>The game, as one might guess, is set in a virtual Wild West.
Players mosey round the eponymous imaginary town, gamble on card
games, buy items from the general store and, of course, get
involved in quick-draw gun fights against outlaws. Like most
interactive computer games Grizzly Gulch allows players to adopt a
character which they then use to explore a computer-generated world
full of surprises and dangers, in a complex plot which changes
depending on decisions made during the game.</p>
<p>So why is Grizzly Gulch different? "Absolutely no vision is
required to play this game," say its makers Bavisoft (<a href=
"http://www.bavisoft.com/">www.bavisoft.com</a>). "It's like
nothing you've experienced before - a game you have to hear to
believe".</p>
<p>Bavisoft was established this year, and is dedicated to creating
superior quality software for the blind and visually impaired.
Grizzly Gulch is the company's flagship product and reflects a
mushrooming interest in blind gaming in the US, where the visually
impaired have access to a growing number of games produced by both
professionals and amateur programmers.</p>
<p>The gaming frenzy in the States does not appear to be reflected
in the UK, however. The RNIB's Technology Information Service has
only had a few enquiries about computer games, and developers
dedicated to blind gaming in this country are hard to find.</p>
<p>Even so, dozens of computer games for the visually impaired are
listed on the US website Disability Specialtys (<a href=
"http://www.disabilityspecialtys.com/">www.disabilityspecialtys.com</a>)
� a website staffed by, and run for, the visually impaired and
people with other disabilities.</p>
<p>Among those catalogued include Destination Mars, which involves
navigating a spaceship, and Run for President, in which you must
outwit your computer in a virtual election for the White House.
Gamers may also seek the mythical Excalibur in Arthur's Quest,
enter the world of Star Trek or play a simple version of
Monopoly.</p>
<p>Two of the most advanced games available pitch players into
situations where they have to use a series of non-visual clues and
prompts to solve complex problems. The advanced submarine
simulation game Lone Wolf requires good compass skills, while Haze
Maze players are challenged to navigate themselves through mazes
using the changing sound of footprints and other audible clues.</p>
<p>While conventional designers have used 2-D or 3-D graphics and
sound to build games, those programmed for the blind and visually
impaired usually depend entirely on audible prompts and speech.</p>
<p>Bavisoft have used more than 1,000 digitally recorded sound
effects for Grizzly Gulch. Original music is used, with
professional voice recordings for the characters and 'full stereo
environments' for each of the many locations. Users can also access
a fully audible help facility.</p>
<p>Although Grizzly Gulch is well-produced and has received good
reviews it is also among the most expensive games at around 50 US
Dollars. To play you must also have a DirectX compatible stereo
sound card and speakers, and indeed it is essential before buying
any games online to carefully check the minimum system
requirements.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum there are a multitude of
simpler games that are available free or for very little. Robert
Betz is the brains behind the Floridabased Accessible Games<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.gamesfortheblind.com/">www.gamesfortheblind.com</a>)
and he is committed to producing simple, easy to play games at a
reasonable price. "I am blind myself, so I know the financial
burdens many blind people experience. For this reason, I only
charge 10 US Dollars for each game," he says.</p>
<p>"I spend a great deal of time writing help files for all my
games. A user should be able to read the help file one time, and
know everything they need to know about the game." One of his games
is Accessible Battleship, which is based on a simple grid. As the
player move from cell to cell the grid co-ordinates are spoken by
their screen reader - in this case Battleship is compatible with
JAWS for Windows. A combination of sound effects and spoken
feedback are used to inform the player the result of each 'shot'.
Launched just two months ago, Accessible Games now offers seven
games including BlackJack and Yahtzee.</p>
<p>Other US companies in this market include Personal Computer
Systems (<a href="http://www.pcsgames.com/">www.pcsgames.com</a>)
which is operated and maintained by blind programmers. They plan to
launch two new games this year, PCS Space Invaders which is a
reaction game based on audible signals, and Snipe Hunt.</p>
<p>ESP Softworks (<a href=
"http://www.espsoftworks.com/">www.espsoftworks.com</a>) produces
several highly complex games for the blind and visually impaired.
The company has just launched Shell Shock, an artillery-style
command game that can be played by two players. Others scheduled
for release this year include The Genesis Project which sounds more
like a role playing adventure game and 'Battle Chess' which has
still to be officially named. The company says Battle Chess is "a
cross between the classic game of Chess and the bone-crushing
spirit of Doom". Game on.</p>

<strong>SECTION THREE - ANALYSIS</strong><br />
<strong>EUROPEAN POLICY</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>A NEW ERA OF ACCESSIBILITY IN EUROPE?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>by Kevin Carey, Director, HumanITy</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrival of the Disability Rights Commission at the same time
as the imminent incorporation of the European Convention on Human
Rights into UK law is a happy coincidence. It might be somewhat
grandiose to term it the beginning of a new era, but this is
certainly an opportune moment.</p>
<p>'E-Europe', the European Union's initiative on ecommerce and a
fair information society, is picking up speed and we are about to
enter the era of massmarket digital television and web-enabled
phones. If we do not get our accessibility messages across now, we
may miss out for a whole technological generation, saddled yet
again with the trauma and costs of retro-engineering and
indifferent compatibility.</p>
<p>Even now, reference to accessibility often amounts to little
more than tokenism - at the E-Europe Meeting in Lisbon on 10-11
April, for example, one rapporteur ended his presentation with the
sentence: ". . . and, of course, we discussed social exclusion".
There are signs, however, that in spite of the somewhat abstract
and tenuous character of rights declarations, access is finally
becoming an important issue in Europe.</p>
<p>The Lisbon meeting had been called to construct an action plan
for the rapid implementation of EEurope, following on from a
special meeting of heads of state, and it will be ratified at a
European summit in June. One of the initiative's 10 target areas
was the inclusion of disabled people and although user
representation was poor, some headway was made, particularly as the
RNIB was strongly represented.</p>
<p>The sessions on disability tended to revolve around rather
abstract ideas such as "raising public awareness", "avoiding the
fragmentation of standards", "improving standards in education and
employment" and "establishing codes of practice and benchmarking".
Given the rights framework, I had to overcome my resentment at a
debate which considered whether or not disabled people should be
'included', and if so, how far and how fast in order to get
discussion into much more concrete areas. All the abstraction is a
means to an end, after all, so we came up with five priority areas
for action on access: health information; library access;
broadcasting; banking and financial services and mass retail.</p>
<p>The first two of these five areas are public services which all
citizens pay for through a combination of local tax, VAT, income
and other taxes; the last two are vital sectors where profitability
is high; and broadcasting is a mix of public provision (paid for by
a licence fee with a minute concession for blindness) and
profitable private enterprise. It crossed my mind at the time that
my income tax form was inaccessible! Still, the topic is now on the
main EU agenda and we strongly recommended that disability access
should not be in a separate box but should be integrated across the
whole E-Europe agenda.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK's Cabinet Office has been looking into
standards for digital television, particularly as they might be
implemented for the broadcasting of government information and the
facilitation of interactive services such as formfilling and
voting. There will be a section in the next draft on disability
access, largely generated as the result of the web accessibility
guidelines for government web sites adopted by the government in
December 1999.</p>
<p>The situation in respect of Third Generation mobile phones is
less promising because there is much less regulation in this area
than there is in broadcasting, and as technological convergence
advances, it may be impossible to define where largely deregulated
telecommunications and publishing stop and wellregulated
broadcasting starts.</p>
<p>There are three major lessons to be drawn from recent
experience. The first is that lobbying will have to be diversified
from its UK government focus to the EU, to standard-setting bodies
(if you can find them), and to industry. Secondly, there will need
to be a pan-disability dimension which makes alliances with all
kinds of groups which are classified or classify themselves as part
of the "social exclusion" remit. Finally, this necessarily more
complex process will have to be undertaken ever more rapidly which
will entail a hard look at the resources we deploy for lobbying and
at our client consultation procedures; fewer committees and more
networks; fewer binding resolutions and more trust.</p>
<hr />
<strong>SECTION FOUR -</strong><br />
<strong>GLOBAL ONLINE DEBATE</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>GOVERNMENTS MUST LEAD ACCESSIBILITY</strong><br />
<strong>BY EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p>Governments and intergovernmental bodies have a key role to play
in ensuring the design of technology products is accessible to all
parts of society, according to the newly-published report of the
global online think-tank Boosting the Net Economy 2000.</p>
<p>However a direct legislative approach is not the best way
forward, according to think-tank member Professor Elsa Rosenblad of
the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. "I don't think it is
successful to force any kind of technical development", Professor
Rosenblad said. "But I can see two ways of reaching the same goal.
One is enforcement using standards, the other is research to create
new knowledge of the user's situation.</p>
<p>"International Standards Organisation standards, especially ISO
9241 and ISO 9355 regarding ergonomic requirements, could be used
for control, criteria and evaluation of products at governmental
and other greater purchases. That would bring forward a development
of measurable accessibility. Only products that would meet these
criteria could then be considered for large-scale purchases.</p>
<p>"But probably a more successful way of achieving products that
are accessible to all would be governmental investment in new
research into the user's situation. Lack of knowledge on the part
of the designer of the cognitive and physical abilities of the
individual user is a severe problem.</p>
<p>"Accessibility problems do not exist because companies don't
want to solve them, but because they have not got the knowledge to
do it. They are used to working with their customers - the
purchasers - but not with the individual end-users. Accessibility
is determined by a knowledge of the users' goals and handling
capacities, their values and benefits of the use and the context of
use. If this knowledge was available, much better products would
reach the market."</p>
<p>Yong-Suk Lee of the National Computerization Agency, Republic of
Korea, said there was a need for governments to distinguish the
citizen from the consumer. "We all wear different hats. one as a
citizen, one as a consumer. Appropriate policies for the citizen
may be different from appropriate policies for the consumer, and
citizens' rights may be different from consumers' rights.</p>
<p>"When governments are making policies, it is important to make
this distinction. For example, when we want companies to make
products for the disabled, the logic for the policy would not come
from the consumer area but from the citizen area. In other words,
this probably has little to do with consumer protection but
involves protecting the quality of life for all citizens, or the
basic rights of citizens - thereby justifying the strongest of
government interventions."</p>
<p>Cynthia Waddell of the City Manager's Department, City of San
Jose, US, said that unless accessibility components are built into
the design of web sites and networks, significant populations may
be locked out as the web rapidly advances from a text-based
communication format to a graphical format embracing audio and
video clip tools.</p>
<p>"Yet, we have learned that the benefits of accessible web design
extend beyond the community of people with disabilities. Consumers
operating cell phones, personal digital assistants and information
appliances can readily reach the content of the web because
accessible web design separates the content from the presentation.
Most importantly, however, accessible web design enables low
technology to access high technology. Consumers with slow modems
and low bandwidth can access the web even if they do not have
state-of-the-art technology.</p>
<p>"The past month has brought significant breakthroughs in the
area of industry consensus in accessibility. For example, the over
400 members of the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href=
"http://www.w3c.org/">www.w3c.org</a>) have reached consensus on
not only web authoring tool accessibility features but also user
agent accessibility features.</p>
<p>"Governments must also adopt accessible web design policies and
implementation steps. From August all US federal government web
sites and higher education institutions will have to incorporate
accessible web design by law. In fact, US federal contracting
officers for web design sites and services will be personally
liable if they do not procure products or services that have
accessibility components.</p>
<p>"This new federal law also requires that a business losing a bid
for a federal contract can challenge the awarding of that contract
if the business can demonstrate that their product or service
exceeds the accessibility features of the business that won the
contract. The business incentive seeks to reward those businesses
who have devoted research and development on accessibility."</p>
<p>The online debate spanned more than 40 nations in all continents
and was hosted by the publisher of EAccess Bulletin, Headstar, with
backing from Bull Information Systems. The full report of the
