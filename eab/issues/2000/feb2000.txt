ONLINE COPYRIGHT ROW EDGES TOWARDS 
SOLUTION

The long-standing problem of copyright 
infringements in the transcription of internet and 
other online information into braille or other 
accessible formats moved closer to a solution this 
week, following a meeting between rights holder 
groups and transcription agencies in the UK.

Rights holders, led by the Publishers Licensing 
Society (PLS), are now working on a form of 
licensing which would allow the RNIB and other 
named braille producers to capture copyright 
material in electronic formats with the purpose of 
transcribing it into braille or other accessible 
formats.

However the move could merely be an interim 
solution, with the RNIB and others continuing to 
push in the longer term for legislation for an absolute 
right of transcription. The transcribers object to a 
licensing scheme on two grounds: first, on principle, 
in that transcription should be a basic right for all 
visually impaired people; and second, on practical 
grounds, because a licensing system is difficult to 
manage and police.

The transcription problem arises because some 
electronic data, available on the internet or via other 
media, needs to be captured and altered prior to 
transcription into braille or other formats which are 
accessible to blind and visually impaired people. 
However, even where information is available to be 
read for free online, capture and manipulation will 
often infringe copyright because it will involve 
copying, storing and often transmitting the 
information between agencies, which is not usually 
allowed.

The copyright holders are happy to licence trusted 
bodies like the RNIB to use the data lawfully, but 
fear that wider transcription rights could lead to 
copyright material being freely emailed around the 
world between people who are not visually impaired.

David Mann, Campaigns Officer at the RNIB, said 
another potential problem could be caused in future 
by new electronic text formats which used 
encryption techniques to prevent copying, and thus 
block transcription. He said the only long-term 
solution was a general right of transcription for those 
in genuine need.

"Blind people are not expecting something for 
nothing, just the same rights as anyone else. If 
everyone has to pay a charge for certain online 
information, blind and visually impaired people have 
no problem with paying the same charge: it is only if 
information is free to read online, that blind and 
visually impaired people object to being prevented 
from accessing it as well".

Under the new licensing scheme, which is subject to 
a final proposal to be put forward by the PLS in the 
next few weeks, Mann said licensed transcribers 
would notify the PLS whenever they captured data 
for conversion, and in turn the PLS would indemnify 
them against breach of copyright. He acknowledged 
that it was a step forward for transcribers, as 
currently they had to track down individual rights 
holders to obtain permission.


SAMSUNG DEVELOPS DIGITAL GUIDE DOG 
HARNESS

The Korean electronics giant Samsung has 
developed a prototype digital guide dog harness 
which combines the use of the GPS global satellite 
positioning system with the ability to record vocal 
notes.

The harness works in tandem with a wrist-mounted 
device, and together the system will help guide dog 
owners achieve even greater independence and track 
new routes, according to a report in this week's 
Electronics Weekly magazine (web site 
www.electronicsweekly.co.uk - although the story 
only appears in the printed version, cover date 16 
Feb).

Since 1992 Samsung has funded Korea's only guide 
dog school. See:

HI-TECH RETINAL DISPLAYS COULD ASSIST 
VISUALLY IMPAIRED

Miniaturised laser displays which beam information 
and images directly onto a retina from a tiny device 
mounted in the frame of a pair of glasses could be 
used to overcome visual impairment in some cases, 
according to technology design expert Kevin Carey.

The Virtual Retinal Display, currently in 
development by US firm Microvision, uses a rapidly 
scanned beam of light to project images on the eye's 
retina, allowing the viewer to see large, full-motion 
images without the need for a conventional display 
screen. In conjunction with a chip technology called 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), the entire 
technology can be constructed in miniature.

Carey says that the technology could help people 
with imperfections in their eyes by focusing on parts 
which had greatest functionality. For example, 
people with an imperfect cornea but functioning 
retinas may be able to see the laser signals perfectly. 
The technology and others like it could prove of 
"immense importance" in helping the visually 
impaired gain access to the information age, Carey 
said.

Microvision has already pioneered various health 
applications of its retinal technology. An ongoing 
study at the University of California San Diego is 
detecting retinal diseases and vision disorders using 
a portable scanning display which scans a stimulus 
onto the patient's retina. Patients without retinal 
damage saw moving particles throughout their field 
of vision, while patients with areas of retinal damage 
are able to see their own blind areas, and map them 
using a pen-based computer program.

Last month a further futuristic application was 
announced to be tested later this year: the live 
projection of medical scans directly onto a surgeon's 
eyes to improve hand-eye co-ordination during 
micro-surgery.

WEB GATEWAY EXPANDS INTO EUROPE

The International Center for Disability Resources on 
the Internet, a US-based body, is looking to expand 
its collection of links to European web resources 
relating to disability. Relevant organisations and 
individuals can register their web sites at:
www.icdri.org


ILIAD - AN OFFLINE ODYSSEY

Another useful US site to know about is ILIAD, a 
simple and powerful tool that allows you to search 
the internet offline using email.

ILIAD was created by the educational arm of NASA 
as an intelligent search agent to help teachers and 
students who may have limited access to the web to 
conduct searches by sending email. Search results 
are then sent back by email and collected at their 
convenience. The system has become hugely popular 
with visually impaired and blind people because it 
bypasses the visual web browser interface.

READER COMMENT - RADIO ON TV

A reader writes: Dear E-Access Bulletin:
Following on from the article on Digital Audio 
Broadcasting (section two, EAB January 2000), 
which expressed concerns for blind and visually 
impaired people about adding a visual data stream to 
a radio signal, I note that on satellite, you can 
already receive radio stations with data displayed on 
your TV screen, and there are a number of radio 
stations broadcasting music without DJs.

Because information about the records can be 
displayed visually on the TV screen, all you hear are 
records played consecutively. So if a blind or 
visually impaired person wants to know what a 
particular track was because they might like to buy 
it, they currently have to ask a sighted person what is 
on the screen.

This works no differently from the format of, say, 
the ITV Chart show, and I feel therefore that this 
practice lends weight to the argument that radio with 
a visual content is simply television. The purity of 
the medium is already being sacrificed in the 
interests of economy: you don't have to pay DJs to 
present the programmes. So how can we protect it, if 
it is not too late already?

SECTION TWO: ACCESSIBLE BANKING
************************************

CALIFORNIA DREAMING ABOUT 
INDEPENDENT BANKING
By Kristof Burek

It was a trip to California that led one woman to 
decide last year that enough was enough for visually 
impaired bank users in the UK.

Monica Davie has a visually impaired father, and 
had observed with increasing frustration the 
difficulties he routinely encountered in accessing the 
UK banking system. Inspired by finding Braille 
symbols on cash dispenser machines on a visit to 
California, on her return she began to raise interest 
among blind and partially sighted people in the UK 
in forming a group of consumers to talk to the banks 
about making their services accessible.

The fruit of this work was the Visionary Banking 
Project, set up in May last year to push for 
independent, confidential banking for visually 
impaired people.

The project is urging banks to realise the potential of 
various technologies that research shows can benefit 
visually impaired customers and others.

Many of the major UK banks have offered some 
level of provision for their visually impaired 
customers for a number of years, such as bank 
statements in Braille or large print, or instruction 
booklets on how to operate their cash machines in a 
limited way. Many also offer telephone banking 
services, which can be ideal for visually impaired 
customers.

However, there is little consistency between the 
banks, or even within banks. And as many building 
societies became banks, the proportion of banks 
offering any kind of accessible services has 
dwindled.

In October 1999, part three of the 1995 Disability 
Discrimination Act came into force in the UK. This 
makes it unlawful for anyone offering services 
directly to the public to discriminate against people 
with disabilities in offering the service, unless any 
such discrimination can be shown to be 
"reasonable".

However, although the banks' reaction has generally 
been positive, they have also sometimes appeared 
complacent. They are still not establishing as a 
matter of course whether their customers have any 
special needs, and nor has the consistency in the 
levels of service offered by different banks 
improved. There seems to be much resistance in 
making automated facilities such as cash point 
machines and kiosk services accessible to visually 
impaired customers.

There is no good financial reason why services 
should not be made accessible for all. A substantial 
amount of research, much of it EU-funded, has 
demonstrated there are many effective low-cost ways 
to make bank services more accessible. A prototype 
talking cash machine was demonstrated in 1996, and 
since then manufacturers have developed other 
solutions based on infrared technology or the 
provision of an earphone socket, which preserves the 
customer's privacy - and yet the results of all this 
work have largely been ignored.

As Ms Davie found out on her inspirational trip, in 
the US is picture is more advanced. An even stronger 
anti-discrimination law, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, has been in force there since July 
1990, and many visually impaired Americans now 
take for granted that they will be able to use a cash 
machine independently because it will guide them 
through the facilities and services with synthetic 
speech.

Other facilities available to visually impaired 
Americans include Braille embossing on credit 
cards, raised lines on cheques and even computer 
printed cheques. However, provision is still not 
universal even in the US, even after almost 10 years 
with the Act on the books.

The new UK Visionary Banking Project hopes to 
make faster progress. As well as pushing for 
accessible banking systems, it is stressing the 
importance of gathering reliable information about 
customers' needs and the training of bank staff at all 
levels. Ultimately the project intends to broaden its 
aims to other financial services such as insurance 
and pensions.

The project has built up a contact list of about 50 
visually impaired people and many relevant 
organisations including the RNIB, the NFB and the 
British Bankers' Association, and is establishing a 
firm basis to be a credible consumer group to feed 
ideas to the banks, influence research and measure 
whether the banks are providing acceptable levels of 
accessible services.

Among its short term goals are to ensure all banks 
improve the lighting near cash machines; mark all 
machines with clear embossed symbols; and 
distribute comprehensive tactile instruction booklets 
on their operation. It is also urging banks to create an 
easily accessible and widely-known point of contact 
for all disability issues.

In the longer term the project feels it is realistic to 
expect widespread availability of accessible cash 
machines, kiosks, and other delivery channels such 
as Internet and mobile phone banking.

SECTION THREE - ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES
***********************************

BACK TO BASICS - THE ACCESS TOOLKIT
by Robin Christopherson, AbilityNet

Some technologies enabling blind and visually 
impaired people to gain access to computers and 
computing are relatively expensive, like refreshable 
Braille displays, but there are also many extremely 
useful tools which do not mean a second mortgage.

Below is a run-through of the most useful of these 
technologies, many of them free or highly 
affordable.


MOUSE POINTER ENHANCEMENT
As well as the changes that can be made to the 
appearance of the mouse pointer arrow within 
Windows, there are many little utilities that can 
make it any number of exotic shapes, colours and 
sizes, as well as including such features as mouse 
trails and radar-style aids to help find the pointer on 
the screen.

Useful free software includes the Microsoft 
"Intellipoint" mouse driver from 
www.microsoft.com/enable or visit 
www.shareware.com and search for "mouse 
pointers".


FINDING THE TEXT CURSOR
Many people find it difficult to locate the blinking 
vertical bar that indicates where you are typing in a 
word processor.

There is no way of increasing the size, or enhancing 
the appearance, of this cursor, but a free program 
called "follow.exe" can be obtained that makes the 
mouse pointer (that can itself be enhanced for easy 
visibility - see previous section) follow the blinking 
cursor as it moves, enhancing its visibility.


MAGNIFICATION SOFTWARE
Magnification software enlarges the image on the 
screen up to 20 times and tracks whatever moves to 
compensate for the fact that the whole screen content 
is not visible at any one time. Magnification 
software is quite expensive but necessary for those 
with significant vision problems.

For Windows 3.1 there is a program called "Lunar 
Lite" that offers all such functionality and is free to 
download from the supplier's website at 
www.dolphinuk.co.uk and then clicking on the 
"Freeware" link.

For Windows 95/98/NT there are no such freeware 
programs. There are, however, certain magnification 
programs with limited functionality that are free and 
may help those who would like to enlarge the 
occasional item that cannot be enlarged by in-built 
Windows features.

One such program is the Magnifier in Windows 98. 
Another package is the Microsoft "Intellipoint" 
mouse driver that is compatible with all Microsoft 
mice, which includes a magnifying lens (Windows 
3.X only). The lens is a small rectangle whose 
contents is a magnified version of whatever is 
around the mouse pointer. It is downloadable from 
www.microsoft.com/enable.

Screen Loupe (Windows 95/98/NT) is a similar lens 
program, which can be used with any mouse - free to 
try, 20 US Dollars if you decide to keep it. See:
http://www.execpc.com/~sbd/Loupe.html

KEYBOARD STICKERS
A set of large-character keyboard stickers can be 
purchased from Dolphin Computer Access (01905 
754577) at a cost of £15 in a range of foreground 
and background colours. They are stuck onto the 
existing keys to improve visibility.


TEXT-TO-SPEECH SOFTWARE
There are several programs available that enable 
blocks of text within a word-processor document, for 
example, to be read back with synthesized speech 
output.

For example, "Reader" enables text to be read back 
while at the same time highlighting words a word at 
a time or making them appear one after the other in 
the centre of the screen, in a size and colour of your 
choosing.


SCREEN-READING SOFTWARE
For those who need to rely entirely on speech or 
Braille output to use their computer they require a 
screen-reading program such as "Hal Lite", which is 
available for DOS free of charge. It requires a 
synthesiser called an Apollo 2, which costs £310 in 
its cheapest form (an internal card) but is often 
available for sale second-hand in publications such 
as the RNIB's "New Beacon". Hal Lite is available 
for download from the freeware section at 
www.dolphinuk.co.uk or you can pay a few hundred 
quid for the full version with technical support.

Another screen-reader is Jaws, which also requires a 
hardware synthesiser such as the Apollo, and is quite 
pricey. It is available for download from 
www.hj.com


INTERNET ACCESS
There are several web browsers that offer speech 
and/or large character output.

One of these is IBM's "Home Page Reader". It does 
not include enlarged text but gives excellent access 
to even the trickiest web page. It is available for 
download from www.austin.ibm.com/sns/hpr on a 
trial basis and can be purchased for 149 US Dollars 
on-line. It may soon be available here in the UK for 
purchase through normal IBM retail outlets.

"PW WebSpeak" is a similar web browser that 
includes larger text as well as speech output, but 
does not offer quite the sophisticated functionality in 
dealing with very complex web pages.  It is available 
for download from www.soundlinks.com on a trial 
basis and costs 78 UK Pounds for disabled 
individuals. It is also available on CD-ROM from 
Soundlinks (01494 794797) at 95 UK Pounds.

SECTION FOUR: EUROPEAN POLICY
**************************

E-EUROPE TARGETS 'DISAPPOINTINGLY 
WEAK'

The Royal National Institute for the Blind has 
attacked "disappointingly weak" proposals from the 
European Commission's eEurope initiative for 
improving accessibility for all to the information 
society (see E-Access Bulletin, January 2000).

While welcoming the general aims of eEurope, the 
RNIB said in its official response that "the targets 
and objectives with regard to blind and partially 
sighted people are far below what might have been 
expected".

In particular it said that the needs of disabled people 
should have been considered throughout the 
document, and not just in their own section. "A 
major failing of the communication is the 
'ghettoisation' of the access needs of disabled people 
in section seven . . . the theme of access should run 
throughout the areas of action . . . Indeed, the targets 
in the other sections could not be successfully met 
without the incorporation of disabled people".

Thus for example the programme's targets for 
employment; the cost of accessing the internet; and 
access to healthcare online should all take into 
account the importance of accessibility to blind and 
visually impaired people, the RNIB said.

The most extreme criticism was reserved for the 
commission's "inexcusable" blunder of releasing the 
eEurope document only in an online format - pdf - 
that is not itself accessible. The RNIB said it was 
"extremely disappointed to find that, ironically, a 
document with a significant section on accessibility 
for disabled people, was not in fact accessible to 
blind and partially sighted people".

The RNIB said that the accessibility targets which 
were set in section seven were too distant. "By the 
time they come into effect they will be meaningless. 
The targets are also unnecessarily weak, with too 
much emphasis on commitments and not enough on 
actions".

Thus for example the commission has proposed a 
target by the end of 2001 that: "The commission and 
member states should commit themselves to making 
the design and content of all public web sites 
accessible to people with disabilities". The RNIB 
says this target should specify full adherence, not 
just "commitment".

Further revised and additional targets suggested by 
the RNIB include:

"By end April 2000: The European Commission and 
member states should adopt the standards of the Web 
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in relation to the 
design of web sites, web authoring tools and agents. 

"By end April 2001: All for-profit and public sector 
web sites must adhere to WAI standards to ensure 
full participation.

"By end 2001: Development of a piece of browser 
software that people with disabilities can use to 
browse the web, that is written to WAI standards and 
that can read web sites that are written to WAI 
standards. This software should be distributed to 
disabled net users at no cost."
