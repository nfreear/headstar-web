<p><strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong></p>
<p><strong>MACROMEDIA EMBRACES ACCESSIBLE ANIMATION</strong></p>
<p>Macromedia, the California-based leader in web animation, has
announced a range of developments to make its software more
accessible to blind people.</p>
<p>Free extensions to its Dreamweaver software will enable web
developers to evaluate their sites for accessibility. They can be
downloaded from: <a href=
"http://exchange.macromedia.com">http://exchange.macromedia.com</a></p>
<p>Macromedia also announced plans for a Flash Accessibility
Developer Kit and future enhancements to its Flash Player, expected
by the end of the year. The developer kit will contain guidelines
and sample code to fully support development efforts.</p>
<p>An upcoming version of the Macromedia Flash Player will be
modified to allow access to underlying data within an animation
file, permitting the text within to be interpreted by assistive
devices. Two new commands for Macromedia's Fireworks package
confirm that 'Alt' text tags for images are being used, and that
complex sliced image maps are properly tagged.</p>

<p><strong>LASTMINUTE.COM UNVEILS VOICE PORTAL PLANS</strong></p>
<p>"I'm in the West End this evening and I want two tickets for
Chicago and a nearby restaurant booking after the show". This is
apparently the sort of thing that users of a new voice recognition
portal to lastminute.com's online shop will be able to say and
receive an immediate response with details of availability and live
booking of all relevant services.</p>
<p>The voice recognition gateway will be accessible by telephone
and mobile phone as well as PCs, digital television and personal
digital assistants that have audio and telephone capabilities. It
has been designed for Lastminute.com by Nortel Networks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the announcement from the two companies does not
specify a date for the service to go live, because E-Access
Bulletin is raring to try it out and see if the West End show
example really works, or whether one would end up instead with
plane tickets to fly to Chicago.</p>
<p>Nortel says the service will be the first fully transactional
e-commerce voice gateway, although it says it is already working
with a number of other unnamed customers on similar offerings.</p>
<p><strong>MSF UNION HOLDS ACCESSIBLE ONLINE ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>The Manufacturing Science and Finance union (MSF) has become the
first UK organisation to use fully accessible electronic voting in
an internal poll of its 300,000 members.</p>
<p>The union joined forces with US software company VoteHere.net
(<a href=
"http://www.votehere.net">http://www.votehere.net</a>)<br />
and Electoral Reform Ballot Services<br />
(<a href="http://www.erbs.co.uk">http://www.erbs.co.uk</a>)<br />
to ask members whether they wanted to merge with the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU).</p>
<p>The partnership provided email voting through the ERBS website.
All members were sent individual PIN numbers to access the site,
and voting ran from September 29 to October 23, resulting in a 90%
majority in favour of the creation of a new superunion.</p>
<p>VoteHere says its 'Gold' online voting system, the one used by
MSF, has been fully tested for accessibility to people with
disabilities including blind people. A spokesman for the MSF said:
"Though we do not know how many visually-impaired voters used the
site this time round, we are planning to use the same system for
the legal ballot later in the year, and we will definitely track
them then."</p>
<p><strong>DATE SET FOR OLYMPICS CASE</strong></p>
<p>The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has
set a date of 6 November for a hearing to assess damages due to the
blind Internet user Bruce Maguire, following a successful earlier
complaint from Maguire about the inaccessibility of the official
Olympics and Paralympics web sites.</p>
<p>The Australian Olympics organising committee SOCOG rejected last
year's ruling by the commission that the web sites were
inaccessible to access devices such as speech readers, arguing on
the advice of its technology partner IBM that remedial action would
be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>In a case which could set a valuable precedent for web
accessibility campaigners worldwide, Maguire told E-Access Bulletin
he will now be seeking damages for "humiliation, and loss of
opportunity to participate fully in the Games, plus legal costs".
If SOCOG refuse to comply with any damages assessment made by the
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity, Maguire will seek enforcement
in the Australian Federal Court.</p>
<p><strong>WEB SITES THAT SUCK</strong></p>
<p>'Web sites that suck' is the new section for Ten-20.com, a UK
web portal for disabled people. The section intends to name and
shame sites that are inaccessible to disabled people, which should
really know better - sites for example like 'youreable.com'
<a href="http://www.youreable.com">http://www.youreable.com</a>,<br />

a disability information service which recently won 1 million UK
pounds in development money from Channel 4's 'emillionaire'
show.</p>
<p>Here is a typically colourful quote from Ten-20.com: "Business
is not all about profit and loss, business is all about people, and
people matter. Get the people factor right and you are half way to
a successful business. What really gets my goat is when this profit
factor is disguised and commercial companies try to give the
impression they are just there for the greater good of
mankind".</p>

<p><strong>TACTILE DIAGRAMS - GUINEA PIGS WANTED</strong></p>
<p>Volunteers are being sought by a post-graduate student at
Lancaster University, Leanne Thompson, to take part in her PhD
project investigating the design of tactile diagrams and graphics
for blind people.</p>
<p>Ms Thompson wants to conduct some practical experiments on how
blind people's tactile perception works, with a view to applying
the results to evaluate both standard tactile diagrams and
computer-based designs, possibly including three-dimensional
virtual reality graphics and diagrams.</p>
<p>Any readers of E-Access Bulletin who are blind, live within
travelling distance of the Lancaster University campus and are
interested in taking part in this project, should contact Leanne by
telephone on: 01524 65201 extension 93560 or email: mailto:<a href=

<p><strong>FREE MEMBERSHIP TO AUDIO BOOK CLUB</strong></p>
<p>'Expert witness' by Jeffrey Archer and 'Just practising' by
David Grant from the BBC's Animal Hospital are among current
best-sellers in the Audio Book Club, a commercial talking book
service for the blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p>The club has announced that membership is now free "for the
foreseeable future", so users need only pay when they buy a book on
audio two-track cassette or CD. A list of selected products is sent
out by email or floppy disk six times a year.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: DIGITAL LIBRARIES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES?</strong></p>
<p>A new research programme has been set up to investigate the way
blind and visually-impaired people navigate digitised library
catalogues and other information retrieval systems.</p>
<p>The NoVA (Non-Visual Access to the Digital Library) project will
study the differences between library searching methods in
partially and fully-sighted users, with the aim of influencing
system design in future to ensure full accessibility.</p>
<p>Project manager Jenny Craven told EAB: "Fully-sighted people
have a choice about how they view the screen, so they can navigate
a website by jumping back and forward and from one image to
another. Blind or partially-sighted users have to listen to all the
information they are presented with. They don't have a choice.</p>
<p>"A good example of this is the use of frames in a web
environment, to help the user perform complex selections between
categories. A sighted person navigates in a nonlinear manner,
whereas a non-sighted person has to navigate in a linear way within
one frame at a time. They may also need to backtrack a long way,
returning through information they have already received, to get to
the desired point.</p>
<p>"Although much work is going on to make interfaces accessible -
for example the World Wide Web's Accessibility Initiative - there
is little current work going on about how blind people operate in
this field. Work on accessibility tends to concentrate on
transcribing text, or replacing images with text, when the problem
may in fact be much deeper."</p>
<p>As part of the project, visually-impaired users will be asked to
perform a series of searching tasks, using three different types of
library search engine. They will be asked to explain how they do
things and why.</p>
<p>The first pilot is to take place in early November, and the
project is funded to last for two years. It is being run from the
Centre for Research in Library and Information Management (CERLIM)
at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>
<p>CERLIM has already completed a research programme that made the
case for fully-accessible information retrieval systems in
libraries. Called REVIEL, the study took feedback from a group of
blind volunteers who evaluated a series of websites which had
already been studied by REVIEL. The volunteers accessed the sites
through the internet and used pwWebspeak software.</p>
<p>The report said: "While in its formative years the web's use of
visual images was largely decorative, but it is now much more
commonly using each medium to carry significant content.
Consequently a person unable to access one medium, whether it be
visual, aural or textual, is unable to use the resource
effectively. The WWW Consortium, the body responsible for web
standards, has made a strong commitment to accessibility, but too
often the issue is ignored or give low priority by content
publishers."</p>
<p>The study used a group of volunteers with differing levels of
expertise. It was decided that this reflected real life situations,
with individual users of a library or information service having
different levels of experience, and differing needs.</p>
<p>It found that: "In general, volunteers commented that sites did
not provide an adequate explanation of the services they offered,
what was included on the site and more importantly what their
acronyms stood for". For example the national educational
information body NISS simply describes itself at 'Information for
education'. Web site addresses could also be confusing, with
organisation names or acronyms used in web domains differing from
those used elsewhere.</p>
<p>"The volunteers also found it frustrating to have to read
through a lot of text in order to get to the link they wanted", the
report said. "An example of this is where alternative text for an
image has been included alongside the actual text. The screen
reader will read not only read the alternative text, but repeats of
the same text as it appears on screen. When this happens at the top
of the page users find it time consuming and very tiring."</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: CASE STUDY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GUIDE DOGS FOR THE BLIND ASSOCIATION</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NO HIDDEN LINKS - JUST ONLINE PUPPIES</strong></p>
<p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association (GDBA) has launched a
new website to coincide with a major restructuring of its
services.</p>
<p>The new site combines news, games, information on fund-raising
and special interest information for both blind people and dog
lovers, as the charity expands to provide more specialised social
care support for its client group.</p>
<p>The site is now fully-accessible, so visually-impaired users
need not browse a text-only version, as they did with the old site.
GDBA publications officer Katie Roberts has overseen its
development. She tells EAB: "Even on the old site we were getting
100,000 hits per month, so we would hope that figure will rise
considerably with the redesign.</p>
<p>"We decided to build a new site after the findings of our
research showed that around 200,000 people were crying out for
better social care services. We will now be offering things like
mobility training and low vision training, in conjunction with
regional social services departments. With this major new aspect to
service delivery we thought it would be a good idea to revamp the
site.</p>
<p>"With the old site it was a case of 'blind people this way,
fully-sighted people the other way'. Now we have tagging
descriptions for everything, like buttons and photos."</p>
<p>The website uses bright colours and a mix of graphics. It
features eight main sections: news and events; information on GDBA;
user support and advice; fundraising and volunteering; dogs;
puppies; eyesight issues and information on and from regional
offices.</p>
<p>Within this the user can access everything from freebies and
games - where they meet a set of animated puppy characters who live
on the site - to benefits advice, pets travel schemes and
information on vets and breeders. There are also schemes like puppy
walking and sponsoring a litter.</p>
<p>"The site is much more dynamic, because all our regional offices
are hooked up to it and are feeding in and updating information
constantly", Roberts says. "It's still evolving too."</p>
<p>In the long term, plans for the site are even more ambitious. As
the largest breeder of working guide dogs in the world, the charity
hopes to raise extra revenue through providing international
services. And it has already been contacted by a variety of
dog-related companies, interested in offering sponsorship.</p>
<p>"The old site didn't even have the facility for online donations
- this one does. It was really exciting when the first bit of money
came in", Roberts says.</p>
<p>"Another long term plan is to develop really good chat rooms, so
users can communicate with each other. This is really important for
visually-impaired people because it's a great way to build support
networks and discuss issues.</p>
<p>"Sound is another thing we want to experiment with, because of
the obvious accessibility advantages for blind people. As the
technology broadens, so will our horizons! We also plan to add more
interactive games, which we are challenging a range of educational
institutions to come up with ideas for."</p>
<p>The GDBA 'kid's club' already has 10,000 members, and it hopes
to boost this through the site. Corporate sponsorship for the club
is another priority.</p>
<p>The new site's overall budget - including advertising, design
and freelance commissioning - is 50,000 UK Pounds, which hasn't
been completely spent yet. It was designed by Synergy, in
consultation with visually-impaired people. There are no drop-down
menus on searches or forms, it runs with the latest version of Jaws
and contains hidden links to the main body copy so
visually-impaired users do not have to listen the same information
again and again.</p>
<p>Roberts says: "This new website could open up lots of different
avenues. The internet is very important for visually-impaired
people, who often have difficulty getting out and about. We want to
address those needs and at the same time broaden the organisation's
horizons."</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: BACK TO BASICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ADAPTING WINDOWS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SIZE, COLOUR AND CONTRAST MATTER</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways that Windows operating software can be
altered to improve visibility for people with a visual
impairment.</p>
<p>Ensuring that your screen resolution is no higher than 800x600
is a good starting point - at this setting, text and pictures will
be larger than at higher resolutions. You should probably not
select a lower resolution than this, however - with versions of
Windows any later than 3.x, choosing 640x480 resolution for example
can cause problems with portions of more complex screens
disappearing off the side of the screen.</p>
<p>To change the display settings, pull up the Windows 'Start' menu
and select Settings and then Control Panel. Next double-click on
the Display icon and find the Settings tab to make the necessary
changes.</p>
<p>It is also possible to increase the size, and change the colour,
of the mouse pointer icon, or change the shape of the icon from the
standard arrow to various other shapes.</p>
<p>Go to the control panel window as above, then open the Mouse box
by double clicking on the Mouse icon or moving to the icon with the
arrow keys and pressing Enter. Bring the Pointers page to the front
by clicking on the tab or pressing Control+Tab.</p>
<p>You can now use the arrow keys to move up and down through the
standard pointer schemes. There is one called 'Windows Standard
Large'. You may or may not see 'Windows Standard Extra Large'
depending on your installation. If you do not, AbilityNet can
supply the necessary software (see contact details at the end).</p>
<p>The 'Windows Standard Inverted' schemes make the pointer white
over a black background and black over a white background.</p>
<p>The mouse pointer changes shape when it is over different
objects. For example, when it is over the document window it is a
thin 'I-beam' that might be difficult to see. It is possible to
assign a more visible shape, such as the arrow, to make the pointer
easier to see at these times. The Large and Extra Large pointer
schemes have the larger arrow assigned to all instances where
pointers are more difficult to see.</p>
<p>Another visibility enhancement option is to change the colour
schemes used within Windows. Open the Control Panel as before and
then open the Accessibility panel by double clicking or moving the
highlight with the arrow keys and pressing Enter. Bring the Display
page to the front by clicking on the tab or pressing Control+Tab
twice.</p>
<p>Now click the check box next to "Use high contrast" or tab once
and press the spacebar for the same result.</p>
<p>Click on the High Contrast Settings button or tab again and
press spacebar. A dialog box appears that allows you to choose the
high contrast colour scheme of your choice. These are predominantly
white text on a black background or black text on a white
background. Click on your choice or tab once and arrow up and
down.</p>
<p>To increase the sizes of fonts used by Windows 95 or later
versions in menus, buttons and some dialogue and message boxes
choose the Custom option and tab again to the box in which you can
arrow through schemes that include the words 'large' or 'extra
large' next to them which indicate that they will affect the size
of the text.</p>
<p>The one that might be considered to offer the best support for
many visually impaired people is 'High Contrast Black Extra
Large'.</p>
<p>These colour schemes can also be used as a starting point for
your preferred combination of colours and text sizes. Each screen
element may be changed and the new colour scheme saved under a new
name.</p>
<p>To customise the colour schemes, open the Control Panel as
before and then open the Display item by double clicking or moving
the highlight with the arrow keys and pressing Enter. Bring the
Appearance page to the front by clicking on the tab or pressing
Control+Tab twice.</p>
<p>This page contains a snapshot of a sample Windows screen and
below a bar listing the currently selected `colour scheme'.</p>
<p>To change to a new pre-set scheme, click the mouse on the
`colour scheme' box and press the up and down arrow keys. When the
snapshot looks good press the enter key to select it. Some of these
" 'High Contrast' schemes include contrasting colours and larger
fonts.</p>
<p>To create an entirely new colour scheme, first select one of the
pre-defined schemes as a basis for your own as above. Choose the
item you wish to change by clicking on a particular element in the
snapshot window or by Tabbing three times to and moving up and down
through the 'Item' box below it with the arrow keys.</p>
<p>You can change the foreground (text) and background colours of
each item by clicking on the coloured block (bottom right) or
pressing Tab until highlighted the block is highlighted and and
pressing Enter. A colour palette will appear and you can click on
or arrow around and press Enter on the desired colour.</p>
<p>To save changes click or Tab to and press Enter on the 'Save As'
button, give it a name and press Enter.</p>
<p>Windows 98 also has a utility that can enlarge part of the
screen. If it is not to be found in the Start menu, under Programs,
'Accessories', 'Accessibility' and 'Magnifier' then it will need to
be installed from your Windows CD.</p>
<p>When running there appears at the top of the screen a window
that shows a magnified area of the lower screen. It will follow
whatever is moving (although there are bugs that mean that it won't
track as you type in Word 97 and perhaps other packages too).
Whenever the mouse is moved it will follow the pointer to include
that part of the screen in the magnified window.</p>
<p>Microsoft's magnifier is really only useful as a backup for
those who can see the larger of the fonts in the 'High Contrast'
colour schemes but who have difficulty reading certain dialogue
boxes that are unaffected by the larger font changes.</p>
