<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DESIGN FORUM CHAMPIONS</strong><br />
<strong>USABILITY AND AESTHETICS.</strong></p>
<p>Design issues facing young disabled people are the subject of a
public forum to be hosted next month by the Helen Hamlyn Research
Centre at the Royal College of Art.</p>
<p>Design Challenge 2000, in partnership with the Design Business
Association (DBA), recognises that design can play a crucial role
in improving the quality of life for disabled people.</p>
<p>According to the forum's organisers, four million disabled
people in the UK use<br />
equipment or assistive technology to<br />
improve the quality of their lives. However, although many of these
products meet the specific clinical needs of disabled users, they
fail to address their aesthetic or lifestyle aspirations.</p>
<p>"They are engineered rather than designed and stigmatise rather
than integrate, even where they are intended for use as a<br />
consumer product."</p>
<p>The forum's launch follows the publication of reports by the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Audit Commission and leading
disability organisation RADAR on the poor design of products and
services for disabled people.</p>
<p>Some of the UK's leading design<br />
consultancies have been working with user groups ahead of the event
to develop design initiatives focused on the aspirations of younger
disabled users, identified as the one group most overlooked in all
product and service categories.</p>
<p>Design consultancy Priestman Goode<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.priestmangoode.com">http://www.priestmangoode.com</a>)
is<br />
developing a 'Sensory Web' interface to aid internet browsing and
interaction by disabled users. And Design House<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.designhouse.co.uk">http://www.designhouse.co.uk</a>) is
creating an accessible interface for a broadband internet access
using ADSL digital line technology.</p>

<p><strong>20,000 DOLLAR PENALTY FOR</strong><br />
<strong>OLYMPICS WEB SITE.</strong></p>
<p>A blow has been struck for web site<br />
accessibility worldwide with an Australian ruling this month that
the organisers of this year's Sydney Olympics and Paralympics must
pay 20,000 Australian Dollars'<br />
compensation to a blind internet user.</p>
<p>Bruce Maguire successfully took action against the Olympics
committee (SOCOG) in Australia's Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission when SOCOG<br />
refused to make its websites accessible to blind and
partially-sighted people (see EAccess Bulletin, September and
October<br />
issues). On 6 November, the commission ordered SOCOG to pay the
compensation by way of damages for the "pain and suffering" they
had caused him.</p>
<p>Mr Maguire told E-Access Bulletin this week: "This is one of the
highest disability discrimination damages awards ever made under
Australian disability legislation, and the commissioner's decision
makes<br />
compelling reading in its condemnation of the conduct of
SOCOG."</p>
<p>The commission's rulings are not legally binding unless taken to
the Federal Court, although Maguire had said he was prepared to
take the court action if necessary. There were fears, however, that
the committee � set up as a temporary body to oversee the Olympics
with no ongoing role - might be dissolved before the matter could
be<br />
concluded.</p>
<p>Australian politician Lee Rhiannon, a Green Party member of the
New South Wales<br />
Legislative Council who had taken up<br />
Maguire's case on her website<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.nsw.greens.org.au/parl/lee),">www.nsw.greens.org.au/parl/lee),</a><br />

discovered recently that there was legislation being drafted to
wind up SOCOG's<br />
operations.</p>
<p>"Naturally this was of concern, because it meant there might not
be anyone to take to the Federal Court, and the perpetrators of the
original discrimination would not be held accountable", Maguire
said.</p>
<p>After making the discovery, Ms Rhiannon began a lobbying
campaign to obtain<br />
assurances from the New South Wales<br />
Premier and Minister for Sport and the Olympics that SOCOG would
comply with<br />
the damages order. Last week SOCOG<br />
finally confirmed it would comply.</p>
<p><strong>CANADIAN INSTITUTE EXPANDS</strong><br />
<strong>DIGITAL LIBRARY</strong></p>
<p>The Canadian National Institute for the Blind has launched a
range of innovative new digital library services for its users,
including web and telephone access to daily newspapers and a
customisable interface to accessible web and reference
resources.</p>
<p>The 'VISUNET Canada' service includes<br />
'VisuTEXT', a gateway to accessible digital information including
electronic books and electronic Braille files. Clients can also
link to web sites selected by CNIB librarians for their
accessibility and quality; access VisuCAT, the Library's online
catalogue; and browse Encylopedia Britannica online and other
reference resources.</p>
<p>VisuTEXT also allows CNIB clients to<br />
customise their online experience so that they can easily organise
and access Internet resources. For example, if clients need
information on eye conditions, they could search the system for
relevant magazine and journal articles; locate websites relating to
eye disorders; or search for books and place requests for them
online.</p>
<p>Another new service, VisuNEWS, allows<br />
people to use a telephone to listen to any stories from the entire
content of 13 daily newspapers in English and French, or access the
papers through the library's web site. The VISUNET site is

<p><strong>FUTURE BRIGHT FOR WEB</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESSIBILITY?</strong></p>
<p>Visually-impaired and disabled people will be empowered by the
next generation of internet software to gain full access to the
web, according to a new book by Michael G Paciello, founder of the
web accessibility group WebABLE!</p>
<p>The book explains how to make sites<br />
accessible as well as looking at how<br />
advances in technology could boost<br />
accessibility. It explains current accessibility initiatives; how
to evaluate site accessibility; and web design and programming for
users with disabilities including coding<br />
techniques.</p>
<p>'Web accessibility for people with<br />
disabilities' is published by R&amp;D books, ISBN: 1929629087. More

<p><strong>DISABILITY COMMISSION PUBLISHES</strong><br />
<strong>WORKFORCE FIGURES</strong></p>
<p>Disabled people are only about half as likely as non-disabled
people to be in employment, according to the latest quarterly
labour force survey from the Disability Rights<br />
Commission, an independent body set up to advise the UK government
on civil rights for disabled people.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 3.1 million disabled people in
employment - 12% of all people in work. However, there are more
than 6.6 million disabled people of working age in Great Britain,
accounting for nearly a fifth of the working age population.</p>
<p>Disabled people are twice as likely as nondisabled people to
have no qualifications, the<br />
figures show. They were published via the commission's web
site:<br />

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: WEB ACCESSIBILITY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PUBLIC SECTOR</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PATCHY RECORD FOR IRISH</strong><br />
<strong>GOVERNMENT</strong></p>
<p>The Irish government has taken a firm stance on the
accessibility of web sites produced by its departments and
agencies. It has stated that it wants all sites to be fully
accessible by the end of 2001, and the country's National
Disability Authority has been invited to monitor standards.</p>
<p>However many key sites including that of the Department of the
Taoiseach (the Irish Prime Minister) have a fair amount of<br />
progress to make. A new accessibility primer for public sector
officials with responsibility for websites, published by web
usability experts Frontend, confirms that most<br />
government sites in Ireland are still<br />
inaccessible.</p>
<p>Using the 'Bobby' international accessibility test (<a href=
"http://www.cast.org.bobby">http://www.cast.org.bobby</a>),
Frontend tested three sample sites: Donegal County Council
(<a href="http://www.donegal.ie/dcc">http://www.donegal.ie/dcc</a>);
The Department of the Taoiseach<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.irlgov.ie/taoiseach/">http://www.irlgov.ie/taoiseach/</a>)
and The Revenue Commissioners (<a href=
"http://revenue.ie">http://revenue.ie</a>). The first two were
found to be wholly<br />
inaccessible. The text-only version of the Revenue Commissioners
passed the Bobby test, although the graphic homepage, which is the
main point of entry for the text-only pages, failed.</p>
<p>The most common problems identified with the sites were images
missing 'alt' text tags, poor use of frames, and poor navigational
structure, for example with links appearing out of context.</p>
<p>The paper sets out how current legislation applies to the web,
what accessibility means and how to apply the right site building
techniques.</p>
<p>"Accessibility is a usability issue", it says. "Make a
commitment to investing in<br />
usability and accessibility. Your investment will produce a
measurable return by<br />
delivering a better service to your customers and reducing
development times and costs in the long run, while reaching a
larger<br />
audience. The sooner you introduce good usability and accessibility
practise, the greater the saving on repairs or "retrofitting" a web
site to make it accessible.</p>
<p>"Database-driven web sites in particular can grow at a
tremendous rate, as it is easy to add content on a regular basis.
If this is not accessible, the problems and costs of repair are
compounded. Investing in usability and accessibility will reduce
the likelihood of suffering potentially expensive legal
actions.</p>
<p>"The best practise is to pursue an inclusive development
process. Involve users who are representative of your target
audience from the onset of your project. Include people with
disabilities as well as those without."</p>
<p>Local councils in Ireland are involved in an accessibility
project of their own. The Irish branch of the European Institute
for Design and Disability (<a href=
"http://www.design-forall">http://www.design-forall</a>.<br />
org/) is carrying out a major campaign entitled 'Citizen 2000' to
obtain the<br />
agreement of all local authorities in Ireland, North and South, to
adopt the Barcelona Declaration. This commits them to ensuring the
access of disabled persons to all<br />
information they generate.</p>
<p>So far Drogheda, Dublin, Limerick, Wexford and Sligo councils
have adopted the<br />
declaration and are in the process of<br />
completing the formalities of registration. It is envisaged the
project will take two years to complete.</p>
<p>Although there is as yet no direct legislation in Ireland
concerning web accessibility, planned legislation dealing
with<br />
discrimination against people with<br />
disabilities could be used as a basis for legal action against web
site providers.</p>
<p>The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has stated his commitment to the
work: "The preparation of a Disabilities Bill will proceed as
quickly as possible. I would envisage that the Bill will cover
areas such as access to public bodies, the use of
telecommunications<br />
services and participation in the judicial system. The providers of
basic state services will, from today on, have the concerns of
people with disabilities as part of their core work."</p>
<p>An Inter-Departmental Web Publication<br />
Group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was set up in 1999
to prepare guidelines and standards for public sector web sites.
Its first report can be found at: <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: EDUCATION CASE</strong><br />
<strong>STUDY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ONLINE MENTORING HELPS</strong><br />
<strong>DISABLED STUDENTS DO IT ALL.</strong></p>
<p>Internet-based mentoring, Internet training at youth camps and
disability awareness<br />
training for primary school children are among the expanding range
of innovative projects being pioneered by Washington University
under its 'DO-IT' initiative.</p>
<p>DO-IT � which stands for 'Disabilities, Opportunities,
Internetworking and<br />
Technology' � has a Scholars Programme which assists 20 disabled
maths, science and technology high school students from every
year.</p>
<p>Students accepted onto the scheme must show an interest in
pursuing a college course or career in one of a range of specified
fields in which people with disabilities are<br />
traditionally underrepresented, including maths, science,
technology-related fields and business studies.</p>
<p>Other programmes under DO-IT include<br />
DO-IT Pals, an online community for<br />
teenagers with disabilities considering applying for college or
starting a career; and DO-IT Campers, in which children and<br />
young people with disabilities are taught at summer camps how to
use computers,<br />
prepare for college and employment and network with other students
with disabilities.</p>
<p>All these three programmes are backed up by a system of
mentoring which takes place online, mainly using email lists. Adult
academics or former students with<br />
disabilities are matched with current students or prospective
students with similar<br />
disabilities, and offer them ongoing advice and support.</p>
<p>There is a central email list for all DO-IT participants, and
separate lists for the DO-IT scholars and mentors, plus five groups
of participants with similar disabilities.</p>
<p>Imke Durre, a blind former student at<br />
Washington University, is a DO-IT mentor. "I monitor, contribute
to, and initiate discussions on the DO-IT email lists", she says.
"As a blind DO-IT Mentor, I am part of the general list, the
mentors list, and the list for participants with visual
impairments.</p>
<p>"Besides participating in list discussions, I also exchange
emails with individual<br />
scholars. I have been in particular close contact with an
eleventh-grader who is blind and joined the program this year. We
just write about our lives, and sometimes she asks me questions.
These are usually work and study related, but often people want to
talk about personal experiences with their disability.</p>
<p>"As a blind individual who has completed a PhD in a scientific
field (atmospheric science), I can share my experiences with
students who are interested in pursuing a career in science or in
going to college in general. I can provide advice based on my own
experience and on what I have heard and read about others."</p>
<p>DO-IT grew out of a proposal to the<br />
National Science Foundation by Sheryl<br />
Burgstahler, IT director at Washington University. Its core
programme is DO-IT Scholars, which has so far had about 25 blind
members.</p>
<p>DO-IT scholars receive adaptive equipment on loan, attend summer
camps at the<br />
University of Washington for two<br />
consecutive years, and are in touch with each other and with DO-IT
mentors all year-round through the scheme's various email
lists.</p>
<p>A separate DO-IT project, 'Show and Tell', is aimed at younger
schoolchildren. It sends successful college students with
disabilities to visit pupils in elementary schools to help them
develop positive perceptions of people with disabilities and
experience how people with disabilities use computers and perform
day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>Presenters share information about their disability, set up
problem-solving activities in which the children participate,
answer questions, and demonstrate technology.</p>
<p>Imke Durre has been involved in this project too, visiting
first-grade classes once a week to talk to children about what it's
like to be blind. She demonstrates refreshable Braille display and
speech output from computers - the children love to hear the
computer talk. She also demonstrates how she uses a cane for
mobility and brings along a child-size cane for the children to
try. She shows them the alphabet in Braille and produces each
child's name in Braille for them to keep.</p>
<p>Recently Durre won a University of<br />
Washington 'Hall of Fame' Award for<br />
students who have been involved in<br />
community service and student organisations for at least two years,
for her involvement in the DO-IT program.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SPEECH-ENABLEMENT.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HIGHLANDS COMMUNITY PIONEERS</strong><br />
<strong>VOICE ACCESS.</strong></p>
<p>A major community web site in the Scottish Highlands is taking a
novel approach to speech-enabling its services, using a lesserknown
piece of free software from none<br />
other than Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Caithness Community Web Site<br />
(<a href="http://www.caithness.org">http://www.caithness.org</a>),
set up and built by volunteers in the most Northerly<br />
mainland county in Scotland, has grown in under two years from a
two-page site to a 300-page resource with more than 600<br />
visitors a day. It is now the main source of information for news
and events in the region.</p>
<p>The original concept behind the site was to offer free web space
to every local group and business in the county. "It all started
with Caithness Voluntary Group, where we were putting together
information about all the voluntary organisations in the county",
says site founder Bill Fernie. "I thought we could go one better
and prepare a computer<br />
database, then I thought we may as well put all that information on
a web site too.</p>
<p>More recently, a desire to make the site more accessible to
visually impaired and disabled people has led to innovative trials
of audio capability for the site, combining voice recognition with
speech navigation.</p>
<p>"While we realise that in many ways our site is not good for
people with sight problems we hope to solve these problems by
making it talk. We are at the start of a trial to see if we can
make the site have audio and speech capabilities. That is the
possibility to give audio commands and get the web site to reply
and carry out the orders given by the user."</p>
<p>The group is using a free but little-known piece of software
called Microsoft Agent, a voice recognition tool created to work
towards more intuitive ways for people to interact with their
computers.</p>
<p>The software is described by Microsoft as "a set of services
that supports the presentation of software agents as
interactive<br />
personalities within the Windows interface. Microsoft Agent's
conversational interface approach is an extension and enhancement
of the existing interactive modalities of the Windows
interface".</p>
<p>What this rather confusing waffle often seems to mean in
practice is a slightly irritating little green cartoon parrot that
tries to help computer users. However the<br />
Caithness web team, led by Bill Fernie's son Niall, has adapted the
system for genuine voice interaction with the web.</p>
<p>"A couple of years ago while trawling<br />
newsgroups for web design tips I came<br />
across a discussion about the Bobby web accessibility project",
Niall says.</p>
<p>"I am a JavaScript programmer and this was a big no-no with
Bobby. It seemed to me that instead of trying to advance the
technology of the web, this project was going to take it back to
the Dark Ages. I could not get my head round the reasons for giving
visually impaired people such a raw deal.</p>
<p>"So I introduced the newsgroup to MS<br />
Agent. Many were amazed with the<br />
possibilities and with the addition of a small plug-in called the
'Agent Powertoy' from Costas Andriotis<br />
(<a href=
"http://members.theglobe.com/costas5/windo">http://members.theglobe.com/costas5/windo</a>
ws_05.htm) they could see how much better Agent was than the other
text-reading<br />
software. The only limitation I saw was the interface between user
and PC but as far as reading web pages is concerned I feel it is
second to none.</p>
<p>"This prompted me to start work using the speech recognition
engine also supplied free from Microsoft as it was already
integrated with MS Agent. This I felt could bridge the gap for
people who could not see the screen to select passages or pages to
be read.</p>
<p>"With the business pages on the Community Site a perfect
candidate for another project of mine - the removal of all the HTML
- I knew that this would render them unreadable by most text
readers but a perfect testing ground for MS Agent. Voice navigation
and the ability to request information from any page is my long
term goal. As all of the text most users see on the screen is
created by<br />
JavaScript I would like to have all of the text users can read from
the screen be read by Agent."</p>
<p>So far, the Caithness site's business section is the only area
to implement the technology. As E-Access Bulletin went to press,
the section was being transferred to a new server, but should be
back online within a few days and the team is welcoming<br />
feedback from blind users from next week.</p>
<p>"So far it's going well, and we each have readout functions on
our PCs", says Bill. "This can read any website, not just our own.
The opening business page will have a<br />
limited audio function and response to audio commands, after the
Agent software has been installed on the user's computer. All of
the instructions are on the site but we are encouraging people to
get in touch if they have problems.</p>
<p>"We hope to be in a position eventually to add full readout
functions and possibly even the ability to go into other web sites
from Caithness.org and have them read out as well.</p>
<p>"We think Microsoft Agent has good<br />
possibilities and are surprised that the software - which we
understand is aimed at speech engines for typing - has not been
used in this way before. We would be<br />
interested to hear from anyone involved in similar projects".</p>
