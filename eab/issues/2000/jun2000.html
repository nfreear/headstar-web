<strong>SECTION ONE: NEWS</strong>
<hr />
<p><strong>E-EUROPE PLAN APPROVED, BUT WATERED DOWN</strong></p>
<p>The Council of the European Union has approved the 'eEurope'
action plan for creating a strong and accessible information
society, which includes a series of actions to boost
'eParticipation for the disabled'.</p>
<p>When the plan was published for consultation early this year,
the Royal National Institute for the Blind said its proposals for
improving the accessibility of the Internet were "disappointingly
weak", and that the needs of disabled people should have been
considered throughout the document, and not just in their own
section. "A major failing of the communication is the
'ghettoisation' of the access needs of disabled people in section
seven . . . the theme of access should run throughout the areas of
action".</p>
<p>The RNIB also said that the accessibility targets were too
distant. "By the time they come into effect they will be
meaningless. The targets are also unnecessarily weak, with too much
emphasis on commitments and not enough on actions".</p>
<p>Despite this submission the original targets remain. Indeed,
they appear to have been watered down still further, with the final
wording somewhat vaguer than the original. The initial consultation
document said: "By the end of 2000, the commission and member
states should review the relevant legislation and standards
programmes dealing with the information society, with a view to
ensuring their conformity with accessibility principles." But the
final document says that "By the end of 2000, the commission and
member states to review information society legislation and
standards on accessibility". The all-important phrase "with a view
to ensuring their conformity with accessibility principles" has
been dropped.</p>
<p>Other recommendations which have remained unaltered include:</p>
<p>"By the end of 2000: a recommendation [for the commission,
member states and all other actors] to take account of people with
disabilities in the public procurement of information and
communications products and services.</p>
<p>"And by the end of 2001: A commitment to make all public web
sites and their content accessible to people with
disabilities."</p>

<p><strong>BRIGHT PROSPECT FOR UNIFIED BRAILLE CODE</strong></p>
<p>The formulation of a Unified Braille Code (UBC) shared by the
main English-speaking nations seems set to be agreed by the middle
of 2001, following a series of meetings in London over the past few
weeks.</p>
<p>The meetings have been hosted by the RNIB on behalf of the
International Council on English Braille, a body comprising the
national Braille authorities of seven nations: Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the UK and the US.</p>
<p>UBC has been designed to integrate English Literary Braille
(Standard English Braille in the UK) with special codes for
mathematical and scientific symbols, which are currently coded
differently in different countries. The development of a unified
code is highly significant for digital technology applications,
because it will simplify the international transmission of Braille
files over the Internet.</p>
<p>If UBC is not adopted, global Braille files are likely to
conform by default to US Braille standards, as the US is the
largest Braille software producer.</p>
<p>The latest proposals have now been sent out to the seven member
countries for consultation. For more on the Unified Braille Code
Research Project see: <a href=

<p><strong>CAST IN A NEW MOULD</strong></p>
<p>The Centre for Applied Special Technology (CAST), famous for its
free BOBBY software which checks web sites for accessibility, is
looking for volunteers to help test a new version of its own web
site which is due to go live in September.</p>
<p>The new site will provide more interactive access to the
centre's wide range of resources on accessibility issues. Would-be
site testers will be required to spend 45 minutes at a trial
version of the new site, exploring its content and experimenting
with its tools, before completing a questionnaire and sending it
back to CAST.</p>
<p>Testing is scheduled to begin on July 11th and will run for two
weeks. If you are interested in participating, please contact
Leslie O'Callaghan at: <a href=
"mailto:locallaghan@cast.org">locallaghan@cast.org</a></p>
<p>CAST's current web site is at:<br />

and you can view a version of the new site under development at:

- but this can clearly change so any comments should be reserved
for the formal testing process.</p>
<p><strong>YELL AWARDS</strong></p>
<p>The 'A-Z of Deafblindness', a compendious online directory of
deafblindness resources, has been nominated as a finalist in the
Yell UK Web Awards 2000, hosted by the online arm of Yellow Pages.
The site is a labour of love by James Gallagher, who is himself
deafblind, and has been nominated in the 'Best Personal Website'
category</p>
<p>The A-Z, which is at:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.deafblind.com/">http://www.deafblind.com/</a><br />
includes many articles about the causes of deafblindness and living
with deafblindness; addresses of relevant organisations worldwide;
tuition for the Deafblind Manual Alphabet; and dates for
conferences and courses about deafblindness. There is also a great
deal of information about deafness and blindness separately. The
site has already won some 17 other awards.</p>
<p>Also up for the same award is Jooly's Joint, a technically
accomplished online support community for people with Multiple
Sclerosis created five years ago by Julie Howell, who is Campaigns
Officer at the RNIB. The community now has more than 10,000 members
worldwide. Jooly's Joint is at: <a href=

<p><strong>BROOKESTALK MERGES WITH MS EXPLORER</strong></p>
<p>BrookesTalk, a web browser for the blind and visually impaired
developed by Oxford Brookes University (see also EAB, January
2000), is set to be fused with Microsoft Internet Explorer over the
next few months in a move which will create one of the most
flexible and highly-featured browsers for the blind to date.</p>
<p>The combined browser, BrookesExplorer, will include all the
essential functions of Explorer plus access to e-mail and
newsgroups. The project's leader Mary Zajicek said access to e-mail
and newsgroups had been prioritised because they would help blind
people become part of the mainstream web community.</p>
<p>Currently BrookesTalk is a stand-alone browser which can be used
with a speech output mode or a large text window which displays
words as they are spoken. The browser enables users to 'scan'
information on websites in the way sighted users can, through a
'summary' of web pages. Page content such as numbers of links,
headings and frames are listed.</p>
<p>BrookesTalk also offers abstracting, which means users do not
have to listen to the whole page, and a special search facility
which retains the search results separate from all the other
information on the page such as banner ads.</p>
<p>Also under development is BrookesExplained, targeted at
'non-technology enabled people' including the elderly visually
impaired. This will be a low functionality version of BrookesTalk
to introduce users to internet concepts before they go on to use
more complex software. For more see: <a href=

<p><strong>DESCRIPTIONS TO AID TRAVELLERS</strong></p>
<p>Travelling to unfamiliar places could become a great deal easier
for blind and visually impaired people with the launch of an online
service which aims to build up a database of descriptions of
railway stations and other public spaces.</p>
<p>Describe-online.com has begun by covering parts of the London
Underground, but aims to expand in the near future to include all
Railtrack's mainline stations and then on to other major public
premises.</p>
<p>"I get off a bus, train or taxi in an unfamiliar place and have
no idea what to do next - which direction to go, where to find help
or what facilities are available within metres. As a blind person,
the information I need is not available to me," says Terry
Robinson, the man behind the venture.</p>
<p>The service includes descriptions of individual platforms and
concourses; which line a station is on and links with other lines;
and the number and location of facilities such as telephone booths
and even chocolate vending machines.</p>
<p>Descriptions largely use compass points, which could be
confusing unless you can become orientated: for example, if you are
looking for platform six at Harrow and Wealdstone Station on
London's Bakerloo line, the main concourse description tells you to
use the gate to a bridge in the East Wall. However, if you know
where you came in, you can find out which way you are facing.</p>
<p>Services like this could be invaluable for blind people in the
future, particularly if they can be accessed using mobile internet
devices. For more see: <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: ACCESS TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VALUE FOR MONEY</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXPENSIVE, SUBSIDISED . . . AND UNFIT FOR
USE?</strong></p>
<p>When the belt clip snapped off Ian Macrae's new text-to-speech
reader after he sneezed, he decided that enough was enough. It was
time to provoke a debate on an issue that had been bothering him
for some time: are blind people - and the taxpayer - getting a raw
deal from access technology which is all too often poor quality and
unfit for use?</p>
<p>Macrae, who is the BBC's Disability Programme Unit Editor, has
been a beneficiary of various government programmes to help
disabled people in the workplace. The programmes are managed by the
Employment Service under the umbrella title 'Access to Work', and
involve the use of specialist teams, known as PACTs (Placement and
Assessment Counselling Teams).</p>
<p>However, Macrae says the result of this assistance has often
been a waste of money. Writing in the May issue of RNIB's New
Beacon magazine, he catalogued his dire experiences with a range of
expensive products including a David laptop and an Eureka A4
Braille computer. He had struggled with the Protalk screenreader,
and caused a near fire in a BBC building with an Alva Braille
terminal.</p>
<p>"Basically I think the whole system is a lottery," he told
E-Access Bulletin. "I was given expensive bits of equipment and
they were not up to the task. How much has the government spent on
duff equipment?"</p>
<p>Macrae is calling for a wide-ranging debate on the issue and
asks whether blind people have to accept that there is only a 50%
chance that enabling technology will work. He has already caused a
stir, and has received calls from a number of suppliers and had his
views discussed on national radio.</p>
<p>The British Computer Association for the Blind says the problem
is a complex one, with no quick fix. "I would say Ian's experience
is an extreme example, but the type of scenario he describes
happens much too often," says BCAB chairman Pete Bosher.</p>
<p>Bosher says that while there have been serious problems with the
unreliability and cost of some products, the crucial issue is the
quality of the original needs assessment made by the Employment
Service. He says if real disasters are to be avoided, the service's
technical advisors have to be properly trained and selected.</p>
<p>"Adaptive equipment is expensive and complex. It does require
specialist training and support, and perhaps most importantly, it
requires care and knowledge from the assessor, who decides what
special equipment is needed."</p>
<p>In response to the controversy, BCAB has organised a meeting
with the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss the selection
and training of employment service assessors.</p>
<p>Macrae, however, thinks the problems go much deeper than the
advice offered by assessors. "I'm not sure I've been given
inappropriate equipment," he says. "It has really just been very
flaky." He points out that when he's complained when a product
repeatedly fails the companies are often aware of the problem. "It
seems to me they are not coming clean about the problems up front.
I would say our legitimate expectations are not being met."</p>
<p>As well as the issue of assessment he wants to see the issues of
quality and price debate more fully. "Visually impaired consumers
have the same expectations as someone walking into a shop and
buying a Sony CD walkman," he says. "You expect it to work."</p>
<p>Bosher agrees that claims of over-pricing for access technology
have also been around for a long time. "The accusation was that
companies were charging pound for dollar. You can argue that this
technology is over-priced, but then again, it is a very low volume
market." He points out that some companies, such as the suppliers
of specific products, effectively have a monopoly and says these
problems need to be looked at further.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE - ACCESSIBLE GAMING (PART II)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ROLE-PLAYING GAMES</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STRANDED IN STRANGE - BUT ACCESSIBLE -
WORLDS</strong></p>
<p>"You lie exhausted on the ocean shore, the pounding of the surf
echoing in your ears. As you look out to sea, the cold glitter of
the stars seems to turn the water to quicksilver, the sand where
you lie is dry as dust, and the waves crash over you without
leaving a drop of moisture on your body. All else around you is
shrouded in mist. You realise suddenly that you are grasping
something tightly in your hand."</p>
<p>Welcome to Worlds Apart, a Tolkein-inspired work of 'interactive
fiction' which takes users on a science fantasy journey which is
part work of fiction and part classic role playing game. You
develop the plot according to the decisions you make.</p>
<p>To play, you type in simple commands or phrases, and receive
responses accordingly. For example, after the opening lines above
you could type: 'Look hand' (i.e. look to see what is in your
hand), and would receive the response: "You have a silver locket."
Typing 'Look locket' would then reveal: "You see a silver
mind-locket hung from a chain. You remember it being a gift . . .
but not who the giver was. It is to most eyes a small silver
sphere, but to yours, the shell is only semi-opaque, with a faint
white glow emanating from within it . . ."</p>
<p>Soon a mysterious dark figure appears, and you can try to engage
it in conversation, and so the adventure begins in earnest.</p>
<p>As it is entirely text-based, Worlds Apart is fully accessible
using text-to-speech software and, unusually for a game of its
complexity, it can therefore be played without any sighted
assistance. Computer games can be accessible by chance or design,
and Worlds Apart falls in to the first category: its accessibility
was "just a fortunate by-product", says the game's author Suzanne
Brittan. She says she wasn't aware there was such a large gaming
community among the visually impaired until Worlds Apart was
launched, but she is now working on ways to retain this feature for
the release of her next creation - 'Full Circle'.</p>
<p>Worlds Apart uses a software system called TADS (Text Adventure
Development system), but this does not have to be downloaded
separately: it comes all packaged together at: <a href=
"http://www.igs.net/~tril/worlds">http://www.igs.net/~tril/worlds</a></p>
<p>One of the most successful and praised role-playing games of
all, Nethack, is also accessible to the blind community. This
dungeon exploration game is for the more technically-minded, as
getting started is likely to present problems for the less computer
confident. However, according to the US blind gaming magazine
Audyssey the game can be set up using only standard ASCII
characters making the MS-DOS versions of Nethack completely
accessible to the blind who use speech and/or Braille access
technology.</p>
<p>NetHack can be downloaded for free from: <a href=
"http://www.nethack.org">http://www.nethack.org</a> Further
instructions for getting started with Nethack can be found in issue
21 of Audyssey. The magazine carries a great deal of information on
blind gaming, and can be found at: <a href=
"http://www.espsoftworks.com/textonly/audyssey/audyssey.html">http://www.espsoftworks.com/textonly/audyssey/audyssey.html</a></p>
<p>Other accessible role-playing games are due for release from ESP
Softworks, a US based company dedicated to blind gaming. The
company's president James North told E-Access Bulletin that ESP's
first interactive adventure, Genesis, will be launched shortly,
bringing "vivid audio ambience and cinematic gameplay to the
interactive fiction genre in real-time".</p>
<p>Genesis will pitch players into a secret world of covert
operations against a renegade underground alliance that is
developing one of the most deadly weapons of mass destruction ever
devised.</p>
<p>The beauty of games made by designers dedicated to blind gaming
is they tend not to need a disk full of new, difficult-to-source
software before you can get started. "The majority of our games
will only require Windows 95 or later with a 16-bit sound card (or
better) to run. The only game we have that requires screen review
software is Shell Shock, which may be downloaded for free via our
website at <a href=
"http://www.espsoftworks.com">http://www.espsoftworks.com</a>.
Those games that require dynamic speech will include their own
speech engine", says North.</p>
<p>Another innovation from ESP is the development of a game called
Shades of Doom using feedback from users of a prototype version to
adapt the game prior to its final launch. Shades of Doom is
available from: <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: CONFERENCE REPORT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'VIRTUAL VISION'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>INTERNET LEARNING: A VALUABLE OPTION FOR BLIND
STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>A UK project was at the centre of attention last week at
'Virtual vision', an international conference on open and network
learning for visually impaired people and visual impairment
professionals held at the Arla Institute in Espoo, Finland.</p>
<p>Diane Stacey, Assistant Director of the Royal London Society for
the Blind, told delegates about 'Dorton at a Distance', the
society's Internet-based teaching programmes carried out through
its specialist college, Dorton College in Kent.</p>
<p>The society had found that existing web-based learning
environment software did not give visually impaired learners the
accessibility that was required for its distance learning
programmes, Stacey said. So in partnership with Eyecue Ltd, it
developed its own software VITA (Visually Impaired Training
Archive), designed to be seamlessly compatible with screen
magnification and speech output systems.</p>
<p>The basic layout of the VITA interface is similar to a web
browser. Navigation through a course is achieved via keyboard
accessible 'buttons', menus, daughter windows or hypertext links.
All functionality can be accessed via the keyboard rather than a
mouse.</p>
<p>Dorton at a Distance is currently delivering two courses through
this medium: the European Computer Driving Licence and a Foundation
Certificate in Visual Impairment Studies. Students can enrol
directly over the web at: <a href=
"http://www.dorton-coll.ac.uk/">http://www.dorton-coll.ac.uk/</a></p>
<p>When a student signs-up for a course, the system alerts a tutor
to open a dialogue with the student to assess the speed at which
they want to study and any special needs. This information allows
the tutor to place the student in a relevant 'virtual class'.</p>
<p>The student can then elect to go at their own pace, initiating
new VITA course downloads themselves, or follow a more structured
delivery with the tutor specifying time periods between module
delivery. The tutor is made aware of the progress of the student
via the web server, and can move students from one virtual class to
another if they are moving too fast or slow. "This virtual
classroom approach helps to create a sense of community for the
student, and reduces the isolation that online distance learning
can create", the college says.</p>
<p>As well as email correspondence, the web server hosts a live
chat system to further build an interactive student community. The
system can also be used to deliver training to teaching and support
staff.</p>
<p>Similar projects are underway in Sweden, France and at the Arla
Institute itself, delegates heard. Furthermore, some 378 colleges
and universities of Higher Education in the US already offer full
degrees over the web, and the students taking these qualifications
may never visit the 'real' campus. Neither are these courses
restricted to obscure or small institutions: Harvard and Princeton
are among those which offer them.</p>
<p>The conference debated the often-expressed concern that distance
learning could lead to isolation compared with traditional
learning, because the student does not have the opportunity to meet
tutors or peers and interact informally or socially with other
students studying similar subjects. However, for a student who is
not physically located close to the institution, who may be in
another country without the opportunity locally to study the
subjects on offer, or who may have difficulty with mobility or
cannot physically access a building, the opportunity to join a
"virtual" network of students through video, telephone, e-mail or
web facilities is likely to reduce rather than increase
isolation.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a student will not miss out on social
interaction through adopting a distance learning approach,
delegates heard, and it may sometimes simply be viewed as a better
option because it is cheaper and less problematic than enabling a
student to attend sessions by providing transport, mobility
assistance or funds for this purpose.</p>
<p>All agreed that distance learning should be viewed as a choice
among many available options which should be made in the best
interests of the student, rather than as the sole option available
for people who are disabled or living in remote locations.</p>
<p>However, there was little agreement between the educators
present on whether and when visual contact is needed when teaching
or learning. The two ongoing projects in the use of video
conferencing, web cameras and the visual medium and the feelings
expressed by many delegates demonstrated how important this is
thought to be by many in the teaching profession. The results of
these projects, however, reveal the shortcomings of the current
state of the technology: existing software and telecommunications
options simply cannot yet deliver simultaneous image and sound at
the desired quality.</p>
<p>The Arla Institute is a government-owned centre for vocational
rehabilitation and training for visually impaired and deafblind
people, with the aim of supporting maximum independence and
enabling people to take control of their lives and to gain
employment. Its web site is at: <a href=
