<h3 id="i67-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Talking Cashpoint Machines In Small-Scale European Tests.</h3>
<p> 
 Voice-enabled cashpoint machines are now being tested on a small
 scale in the UK, although most high street banks still have no plans to
 introduce them, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 This month the Belfast-based Northern Bank and Clydesdale Bank of
 Scotland have begun to test Automated Teller Machines (ATMs),
 equipped with a headphone socket for customers to receive audio
 instructions and feedback on their transactions, in a small number of
 locations in Belfast and Glasgow. The tests are scheduled to run for six
 months, after which the banks will consider extending the service to
 more branches.
</p>
<p> 
 "You could argue that a lot of people are being deprived of a basic
 right if they don't have access to this kind of service," said a Northern
 Bank spokesperson. The bank said it would be monitoring the public
 response to the service through informal feedback in its branches, and
 by liaising with organisations like the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 However, most other UK banks show little enthusiasm for following
 suit, despite the widespread availability of such systems in the US,
 Canada and Australia. "We have no formal plans at this stage," said a
 spokesperson for the high street bank Abbey. "If there had been a
 strong customer need, we would have come across it in the focus
 groups we use," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Other banks were similarly reticent. "We do not have any talking
 ATMs and have no current plans to introduce them. However we do
 have systems in place to assist our visually impaired customers," a
 spokesperson for NatWest told E-Access Bulletin. HBOS, HSBC,
 Royal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide offered similar replies. Only
 Barclays said it had plans to test accessible machines, but declined to
 be drawn on the specific details of its plans.
</p>
<p> 
 According to market analyst Retail Banking Research the UK ATM
 market is split between three manufacturers: Diebold, NCR and
 Wincor Nixdorf. "All of them produce the hardware needed to make
 ATMs voice enabled. Some machines would have to be upgraded,
 which is expensive, but there's no reason why the banks can't specify
 this capability for new machines," a spokesperson told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 One high street financial institution which declined to be named told E-
 Access Bulletin it did already have machines installed with a
 headphone socket in the hardware, but it had not enabled the software
 and systems needed to make the machines talk due to concerns about
 software cost, the potential for vandalism and uncertainties over how to
 supply headphones.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB told E-Access Bulletin this week that failing to provide a
 service that vision impaired people can use unaided could be grounds
 for action under the Disability Discrimination Act. "Potentially, this
 could give rise to a claim of non-compliance," said the institute's legal
 adviser Jane Vernon.
</p>
<h3 id="i67-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: First Electronic Travel Guide Published This Month</h3>
<p> 
 Accessible electronic versions of printed travel guides are to be
 published online for the first time this month by Traveleyes, a holiday
 company for both vision-impaired and sighted travellers (
 <a href="http://www.traveleyes.co.uk/">http://www.traveleyes.co.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Users will be able to download accessible Microsoft Word versions of
 the market-leading Lonely Planet range of guides, with discussions
 underway to offer guides from other publishers. Electronic guides will
 not include maps and diagrams.
</p>
<p> 
 The first guide to be available from mid-July will be on Andalucia in
 Spain. Five more titles will follow in August, on California; Egypt;
 Italy; Malta; and Morocco and future guides will cover Australia, the
 US and other European countries.
</p>
<p> 
 TravelEyes director Amar Latif told E-Access Bulletin the electronic
 guides are designed to be downloaded onto personal digital assistants
 (PDAs) and other portable electronic devices. Visitors to the
 TravelEyes site will be able to request areas for which they would like
 a corresponding travel guide; if there is enough demand, an accessible
 version will be created, Latif said.
</p>
<h3 id="i67-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: More Bodies Sign Up To Text Email Newsletter Standard.</h3>
<p> 
 Some 36 organisations have adopted a set of guidelines designed to
 ensure plain text email newsletters are easy to use by people using
 special access technologies such as screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 The Text Email Newsletter (TEN) standard
 ( <a href="http://www.headstar.com/ten/">http://www.headstar.com/ten/</a>
 ), developed by the publishers of E-Access Bulletin, covers issues
 including consistency of text layout and headline format, making
 newsletters easier to search and navigate. It is intended as an optional
 tool for text structure only, complementing existing separate standards
 for web pages.
</p>
<p> 
 The standard was last month updated to version 2.1, following a
 consultation process with all signatories, who include nine UK local
 authority signatories; central government bodies, and 11 disability
 organisations worldwide. The full list can be seen at:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/ten/TEN-signups.doc">http://www.headstar.com/ten/TEN-signups.doc</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 "It's our duty to be aware of accessibility concerns and this standard
 has been developed with those in mind," said Rick Mason from East
 Sussex County Council. "We've used it from the first issue of our
 [email] newsletter," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "[Our newsletters] are now structured and consistent across subject
 areas, which is a great benefit; and more accessible obviously," said
 Daniel Champion, web manager at Clackmannanshire Council; the
 latest council to sign up. "Unlike other authorities we don't offer an
 alternative so all our subscribers are getting the accessible version," he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 The TEN standard is free to sign up to and apply and is available in
 Portuguese and German.
</p>
<p> 
 E-Access Bulletin publishers Headstar are now appealing for
 volunteers to form a steering group to oversee TEN's future
 developments. Any interested organisations or individuals should

<h3 id="i67-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Tickets Please:</h3>
<p>  Bus stops around Bristol were last week fitted with a device allowing vision impaired travellers to hear the time, bus
 stop names, route numbers, destinations and arrival times for eight bus
 routes across the UK city. Users point an electronic key fob at the
 passenger information display at stops to activate audio information.
 "Talking bus stops" were launched by Bristol City Council and RNIB:

 <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i67-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: E-Books Located:</h3>
<p>  In response to last issue's request from Margherita Giordano for accessible versions of the Lord of the Rings
 and The Hobbit, David Owen of the UK's National Library For The
 Blind suggests the library's Revealweb catalogue service
 ( <a href="http://www.revealweb.org.uk">http://www.revealweb.org.uk</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "It holds details of 192,000 books in Braille, large print, audio, Moon
 and electronic format from 102 suppliers in the UK. You can check
 whether the book you require is available in the format you need and
 who can supply it if it is available. It has been designed to permit
 independent searching by visually impaired people."
 [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> ]</p>
<p> 
 Rod Carne from Somerset in the UK writes: "With regard to reading
 where Braille is not an option, if the pupil has any sight the best
 solution is to try the giant size print books produced by the National
 Blind Children's Society (NBCS). Books are available in up to print
 size N48 on various colour paper. Many of the titles can now be loaned
 via the National Library for the Blind (NLB)."
</p>
<p> 
 Leigh Myers from Library Services Specialist at the Hillsborough
 County Talking Book Library in Tampa, Florida recommends the
 Bookshare.org site ( <a href="http://www.bookshare.org">http://www.bookshare.org</a>
 ). "They offer the service to non-US residents, but it is limited. Please send an email to
 <a href="mailto:oreilly@bookshare.org."">oreilly@bookshare.org."</a> Leigh also suggests reading this fact sheet from the National Library Service:
 <a href="http://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/etexts.html">http://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/etexts.html</a>

 which lists many sources for ebooks.
</p>
<p> 
 Chris McMillan suggests the following US-based web site to obtain the
 books: <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook22586.htm">http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook22586.htm</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 And finally Tim Culhane of technology company Critical Path in
 Ireland writes: "I think the simplest thing is to buy the books in audio
 book format. There shouldn't be any problem tracking them down,
 given their popularity. They will be more expensive than the printed
 books, but if you buy them from Amazon or a US-based online
 bookstore you will benefit from the favourable currency exchange."
</p>
<h3 id="i67-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Scan Plan:</h3>
<p>  In our last issue Mark Pimm, Disability Coordinator at Birkbeck College, University of London, wrote in with a query about
 the accessibility of microfilm. Robert Jaquiss of Louisiana, US
 responds: "There are various scanners on the market that claim to be
 able to digitize microfilm and microfiche. I would start off trying to
 scan the microfilm and then use either Kurzweil or Openbook to do
 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the images.
</p>
<p> 
 "OCR works best when images are sharp. A search on Google gave
 several sites that sell equipment and provide conversion services. Use
 the terms; 'microfilm scanning' or 'microfilm digitizing.'"
</p>
<p> 
 And Dick Myers adds: "The way to get microfilm into text usable by
 the blind is to use a photo scanner. These are cheap and fast. Scan the
 film into text using your favourite OCR. I use FineReader 4.0 Sprint,
 which gives over 95 per cent accuracy. The reason you should use a
 photo scanner is that its resolution is much higher than the resolution
 of a standard page scanner. You will need this extra high resolution to
 handle the extremely small print of the microfilm. I recommend a
 Canon photoscanner."

<h3 id="i67-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Screen Solutions:</h3>
<p>  John Getz, director of the blind rehabilitation centre at the US Department of Veterans Affairs, writes in to comment
 on 'The Language of Flexibility', our June article on the scripting
 language used by the JAWS screen reader software.
</p>
<p> 
 "I think it would be important to make sure readers know that, for
 much less money, they could have a screen reader that didn't need any
 complicated scripts or compilation to work with even more off-the-
 shelf software applications than Jaws," he says. "This product is called
 Window-Eyes ( <a href="http://www.gwmicro.com">http://www.gwmicro.com</a>
 ) . I use both programs in order to get the most out of my assistive technology but I realise this is
 not possible for many people, so when one screen reader is all you can
 afford, I'd recommend your readers try Window-Eyes because of its
 simplicity and flexibility."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Focus- Geographical Information Systems.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: On The Mapby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 Geographical Information Systems (GIS or GI) - computer systems
 which link data to location information such as a postal address, often
 linked to digital maps - can be a powerful means to access information
 about an area.
</p>
<p> 
 But such systems are not generally accessible to vision-impaired
 computer users, delegates heard at last months' seminar 'GIS in the
 Public Sector,' hosted by E-Access Bulletin's sister publication E-
 Government Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Of UK local authorities that present services on their web sites using
 GIS, only a handful have made their online GIS services accessible,
 with pioneers including the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea
 and Medway Council.
</p>
<p> 
 Awareness of the issues surrounding accessible GIS is increasing,
 according to Roger Longhorn, Director of Info-Dynamics Research
 Associates. But he said the problem for councils and others was that
 there are few accessible solutions out there.
</p>
<p> 
 "There are many ways of presenting maps to visually impaired users,
 even if it means describing the map to them over the phone and helping
 them with their spatial query by voice," Longhorn said. "It isn't the
 authorities who are failing in providing better access to maps and
 mapping for visually impaired, but the GIS industry.
</p>
<p> 
 "Maybe if enough of us join forces, we can get more attention paid to
 the less abled users of information in our society, including that which
 is underpinned by GIS and displayed on maps," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 One key new development could be the initiation in October this year
 of an 18-month project to produce a standard for accessibility for
 'events and places shown on the web'.
</p>
<p> 
 "We expect to have a quality mark so users know it is valid,"
 according to Martin Ford, a GIS consultant and convenor of a working
 group for geographic information standards, 'ISO/TC 211' (
 <a href="http://www.isotc211.org/">http://www.isotc211.org/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The group is currently putting together a programme on 'ubiquitous
 geographic information,' which includes use of devices such as mobile
 phones in a shopping centre, airports or the home for providing
 directions and receiving information. "We have some powerful players
 signed up to this," Ford said. A draft programme of work will be drawn
 up by September.
</p>
<p> 
 Ford has recently also submitted a technical proposal to the European
 Committee for Standardization's Information Society Standardization
 System (CEN ISSS -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/cen1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/cen1</a>
 ), covering "Accessibility Metadata for Places and Events," in a bid to
 receive funding for further development.
</p>
<p> 
 One Geographic Information Specialist working for the UK
 government told delegates that the key to attaining GIS accessibility is:
 "Awareness, followed by vendor-initiated development. Customers
 need to make their needs known to their GIS suppliers," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the specialist, the most exciting or promising
 development currently in the area of GI accessibility is not a technical
 but a "soft" development. "It is the increasing awareness of the need
 for and right of people with disabilities to access GIS. The technology
 will derive from this."

<p>  The Structure of Inclusion by Matthew Atkinson.
</p>
<p> 
 It is 6pm on Sunday 25 July, 2004. Down the corridor you can hear
 screams and the all-too-familiar sound of grenades being launched into
 the ether. You move towards the room where the sounds seem to be
 coming from. Two people are frantically yelling and bashing away at
 their computer keyboards. It appears that they are playing some kind of
 game against each other, but there is something missing: their monitors
 are turned off.
</p>
<p> 
 That was the first time a blind person ever played a networked game of
 Quake, the seminal first-person-shooter computer game for the sighted.
</p>
<p> 
 Over the past two years, I have been co-developing some software that
 converts the visual aspects of the Quake interface into speech and other
 sounds (see  <a href="http://www.agrip.org.uk/">http://www.agrip.org.uk/</a>
). It also allows internet play, which is something very new for accessible action games.
</p>
<p> 
 Improvements planned for the future (such as 3D audio and alternative
 user interfaces) will add improvements for both sighted and blind
 gamers. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide accessibility not
 just as a separate entity, but as an integral part of mainstream software
 and the surrounding community. This includes affording vision-
 impaired and blind gamers the ability to view their progress online and
 create new levels and modifications for the game: all activities that
 sighted people have been enjoying for some time.
</p>
<p> 
 These are welcome developments, but they are very much the
 beginning of a process which will hopefully lead to greater
 accessibility being built in to many other forms of digital information.
</p>
<p> 
 The Quake work has raised a number of general questions about just
 what makes something as complex as a 3D game accessible. Finding
 solutions will teach us a lot more about accessibility and its links to the
 structure of information in general. Based on the progress made so far,
 a number of related areas need to be explored.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, an XML-based standard for describing 3D worlds is in
 development that could lead to a standard and accessible editor
 program being able to create levels for many different games,
 applications, design and visualisation programs. XML stands for
 eXtensible Markup Language; a customisable text-based tool for
 exchanging information in hierarchical layers.
</p>
<p> 
 And there is great potential in examining the use of alternative user
 interface devices and techniques such as 3D audio in representing
 traditionally inaccessible materials such as mathematical equations and
 flowcharts. I have begun designing a number of techniques for
 generalising the principles used in AudioQuake to these tasks.
</p>
<p> 
 These and other similar avenues of research are exciting, and I am
 hoping to explore them during my PhD. However, there is a key
 element that links the AudioQuake project and these ideas - the
 question of "Why?"  It is currently a combination of common sense
 and convention that leads us to believe we might get some advantage
 from developing using the approaches detailed above, but wouldn't it
 be better if we could get some guidance as to the correct approach?
</p>
<p> 
 A core issue of the work I hope to embark upon will therefore be the
 determination of how to present information in the most accessible
 way given its format (a 3D model, flow chart or word-processing
 document, for example). This will be achieved through the use of
 theory, empirical evidence on how blind and sighted people navigate
 information, and a number of existing technologies for the
 manipulation of data such as XML.
</p>
<p> 
 But what sorts of benefits would such generalised rules, or an
 automated system that uses them, provide?
</p>
<p> 
 When you consider that in 2003, research carried out by Forrester for
 Microsoft discovered that 60 per cent of adults in the US aged 18-64
 would benefit from some assistive technology for computer use, the
 case makes itself. It is clear it would benefit software developers and
 creators of content on the web and in other digital formats to have
 better direction on how accessible their system is and how it could be
 made more so.
</p>
<p> 
 But accessibility is just the start: in almost every walk of life nowadays
 we are overwhelmed with information. Wouldn't it be convenient to
 have this presented to us in the way we find most intuitive? That is yet
 another benefit this research could deliver.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Matthew Atkinson is seeking a sponsor for his PhD at the
 Research School of Informatics, Loughborough University, to top up a
 half-scholarship. Sponsors would gain access to his system and
 associated software as it is developed. Any organisation interested
