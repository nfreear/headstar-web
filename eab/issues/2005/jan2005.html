<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i61-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Opera Gains A Voice.</h3>
<p> 
 Advanced voice functions have been introduced into the latest version
 of Opera, the free web browser software compatible with Apple Mac,
 Windows, Solaris and Linux operating systems.
</p>
<p> 
 The new beta version of Opera, Opera 8, launched for testing at the end
 of December 2004, allows users to browse the web using spoken
 commands and to have web and email content read aloud to them.
</p>
<p> 
 Using a microphone and headset, users highlight the text they want
 read out and say "Opera speak" to have content spoken to them. There
 are 50 different voice commands, including browsing commands, such
 as "Opera next link", "Opera back" or "Opera home".
</p>
<p> 
 The voice feature uses IBM voice technology and is currently only
 available on the Windows operating system. Because it requires users
 to have some sight of the screen to highlight text, the Opera browser is
 principally of use to people with some residual vision.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the company claims that its product is "the most accessible
 browser on the market" with a range of features that includes a zoom
 function for enlarging content by 20 to 1000 per cent, the option to
 change text size and text and link colours, and the ability to disable
 animations, video or audio applications. Users can also implement their
 own style sheets to customise pages as they prefer to view them.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as new voice functionality, the next version of the browser also
 includes the ability to magnify web pages and have content adapted to
 fit the width of the screen. This means that users don't have to scroll
 horizontally when the web page width exceeds that of the screen - "a
 compelling accessibility tool for visually impaired users," says Opera.
</p>
<p> 
 Although not all the browser's functions will be compatible initially
 with screen readers, the company will continue to make improvements
 to offer full functionality to users of assistive techology, Opera told E-
 Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The beta version of Opera's latest browser is available as a free
 download from its web site. The final version of the browser is due to
 be released at the end of February. Opera can be used freely with
 advertisements and at low cost for a version without ads.
</p>
<h3 id="i61-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Safety Games Use Text-To-Speech Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 Interactive online games that educate children about fire safety using
 text-to-speech technology have been launched by the UK's Office of
 the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM - <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">http://www.odpm.gov.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The games, called Route to Safety and Hazard a Guess (both available
 at <a href="http://www.firekills.gov.uk/seniors/fun/">http://www.firekills.gov.uk/seniors/fun/</a>
), can be played with or without access technology, such as screen readers. This enables a blind
 or vision-impaired child to play the game together with a sighted
 sibling.
</p>
<p> 
 The games were developed as part of an ODPM inclusion programme
 to educate children who might return from school before a parent
 arrives home about fire hazards, and are also available on CD.
</p>
<p> 
 Hazard a Guess asks players to rank the severity of fire hazards in the
 home, while in Route to Safety players are asked questions about fire
 safety as they roll the dice and move across the board. To play the
 games online, the user has to download Macromedia's Shockwave
 plug-in.
</p>
<h3 id="i61-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Accessible Conversion For Technical Drawings.</h3>
<p> 
 Free software allowing vision-impaired software engineers to read
 technical drawings produced in many common formats has been
 released following a two-year European Commission-funded research
 project.
</p>
<p> 
 Technical Drawings Understanding for the Blind (TeDUB -
 <a href="http://www.tedub.org/">http://www.tedub.org/</a>
) has been headed by the TeDUB Consortium which comprises partners from the UK, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the
 Netherlands.
</p>
<p> 
 TeDUB works by uploading diagrams, such as the "box and pointer"
 diagrams often used to design family trees, to a web site where they are
 converted into a compatible format and then emailed back to the user.
 It has been designed to work best with diagrams created in Unified
 Modeling Language (UML), a coding language often used by software
 engineers to represent real-world objects.
</p>
<p> 
 The system also allows vision-impaired users to move around diagrams
 with a joystick. It provides basic sound to accompany navigation
 allowing users to hear where they are, and is also compatible with
 screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 The software is available by download from the TeDUB web site
 where tutorials and examples of UML diagrams can also be found. It is
 funded by the sixth framework of the European Commission's
 Information Society Technologies research programme
 (<a href="http://www.cordis.lu/ist/">http://www.cordis.lu/ist/</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i61-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Improvements Urged For Library Computer Access.</h3>
<p> 
 More assistive equipment, trained staff, and consultation with users is
 needed if electronic services in public libraries are to be useful to
 vision-impaired people, according to a survey by Robert Gordon
 University in Aberdeen (<a href="http://www.rgu.ac.uk/abs">http://www.rgu.ac.uk/abs</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Although many respondents thought that electronic information
 services improve the lives of vision-impaired people, there was little
 reason for people to travel to a library when many services can be
 accessed at home using more familiar equipment, the report said.
</p>
<p> 
 The respondents, all experienced users of electronic services, said that
 providing assistive equipment without trained staff would not
 significantly increase use of library services by people with impaired
 vision. Respondents also highlighted the need to involve user groups
 from the start, and to adhere strictly to technical and accessibility
 standards.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, compiled by postgraduate student Andrew Lewis, also
 recommends further work on a national system for delivering
 information electronically.

<p>  In our last issue, E-Access Bulletin technician Nick Apostolidis requested advice on content management systems
 (CMS) that work well with the JAWS screenreader. Bart Simons, a
 web accessibility specialist at Brussels-based communications
 company ASCii (<a href="http://www.ascii.be">http://www.ascii.be</a>
) replies: "Depending on which kind of CMS you are looking for I might recommend Nucleus
 (<a href="http://www.nucleuscms.org/">http://www.nucleuscms.org/</a>
). It does not only provide accessible content but the machinery itself is accessible as well. Of course one is
 free to delete or add accessibility features. It is mainly a CMS to create
 weblogs but if you take a look at 'sites running nucleus,' you will
 notice a variety of sites."
</p>
<p> 
 Martin Vickery, corporate brand manager at the NHS Information
 Authority also responds to Nick's request: "You may be interested to
 know we have just relaunched the website for the NHS National
 Programme for IT (NPfIT - <a href="http://www.npfit.nhs.uk">http://www.npfit.nhs.uk</a>
) using [the open source CMS] Plone. The site was constructed by my team in less than
 six weeks without any prior knowledge of the system but with
 experience of working with open source products and Linux servers.
</p>
<p> 
 "The benefits of putting this together in-house were: speed of
 development; no long procurement process as nothing had to be
 purchased; it is highly accessible, although any CMS is reliant on the
 accuracy of content added by authors; it complies with XHTML, CSS
 and WAI; and we provide links to validators on each page for checking
 which is risky but assists in debugging the system.

 open source working."

</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Readers Move Out Of The Shadeby Peter Irons.
</h3>
<p> 
 A quiet revolution is taking place across the UK.  Day after day, new
 people are rejecting the white background on their computer screens
 and adjusting the gaudy colour displays on websites. Why? It is
 because they find reading screens difficult or tiring, and have realised
 that they can reset it to an optimum colour arrangement, according to
 their personal needs.
</p>
<p> 
 The reading process is akin to any sport: some people find it easier
 than others, and this has nothing to do with intelligence. Studying
 reading is a bit like studying sport science for eyeballs!
</p>
<p> 
 The Eye Science/TintaVision project (<a href="http://www.tintavision.com">http://www.tintavision.com</a>
) started in 1984 because many students found words so difficult when
 they had to read or write them, but not when they were discussing
 topics verbally. The visual component seemed to be getting in the way.
</p>
<p> 
 Whiteboards were being introduced into schools and perfectly rational,
 intelligent students started complaining about the colours of the
 markers that teachers were using. The colour palette on the
 Archimedes- an early desktop computer - soon allowed the first
 objective experiments on colour and reading.
</p>
<p> 
 In 1998, the foresight of David Laycock, manager at the University of
 Westminster's Computer Centre for people with Disabilities
 (<a href="http://www.wmin.ac.uk/ccpd">http://www.wmin.ac.uk/ccpd</a>
), led to a study of human computer interaction focused on access to text. My own team started a
 methodical study of the outcomes of changing the background and
 foreground colours on the computers that dyslexic students were
 getting as part of their Disabled Students Allowance.
</p>
<p> 
 In 1999 it started to become clear that people's access to text could be
 enhanced by measuring their response to changes in pixel brightness
 on a screen. Since then, things have moved a long way. For example, a
 person we have seen recently had been told that she needed a yellow
 filter because it "helped dyslexic people". She is now using a computer
 screen which is a sort of "muddy cyan" in colour, reading three times
 as fast and reading for fun. All web sites she views are now displayed
 with that background, and she now loves her computer!
</p>
<p> 
 Over the past two or three years it has become increasingly accepted
 by academic researchers that colour is important in access to text, and
 the growth in awareness seems to be almost exponential. In computing
 and retinal biology, colour is definable very precisely whereas many
 people see it as an "arty" or "fluffy" concept. Most people think that as
 long as the background is not "white," it is "colour". This is a bit like
 having a counting system that only goes up to two or three.
</p>
<p> 
 At a recent London seminar hosted by E-Access Bulletin's sister
 publication E-Government Bulletin (<a href="http://www.electronic-">http://www.electronic-</a>

 government.com/accessibility/), it became clear that the three main
 tools to be applied in response to disability legislation, with the
 purpose of improving access to the web are user's choice of font size,
 background colour, and compatibility with speech-generating software.
</p>
<p> 
 The challenge we face now is to raise awareness in the 'accessibility
 industry' to a level where precise, measured colour is understood to be
 part of creating a level playing field for users.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: Fighting Against The Storm.</h3>
<p> 
 My story begins after the St. Lucia Blind Welfare Association
 (SLBWA) in the Caribbean received 14 reconditioned computers,
 equipped with speech output software JAWS, from a charitable
 organisation in Europe. The problem was that no one in St. Lucia knew
 anything about JAWS. But one person's problem is another person's
 opportunity, as I was soon to learn.
</p>
<p> 
 My opportunity to go to St. Lucia came when I convinced the
 Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB -
 <a href="http://www.cnib.ca/eng/">http://www.cnib.ca/eng/</a>
), and the SLBWA that I was the best candidate for a posting as an intern from Canada for the CNIB and

 I had never heard of St. Lucia, but so what! I knew this was an
 opportunity that I had to grab.
</p>
<p> 
 My guide dog Dabney and I landed at Hewanorra Airport on the south
 end of the island, where we were met by the director of the SLBWA
 and some of his staff. I guess we were quite a sight. After the long
 flight and my mobility challenge - of which they had been unaware - I
 came wobbling off the plane and through the airport. As I later heard,
 their initial reaction was: "What have we got ourselves into?"
</p>
<p> 
 Dabney was the first guide dog on the island, so the first couple of
 months was spent on orientation. Introducing St Lucians to the concept
 of a service animal that went everywhere with me proved interesting -
 most dogs in St. Lucia are feral or aggressive guard animals and
 receive little attention. But the education went smoothly despite a few
 confrontations with business owners and park managers and the staff
 and members of the St. Lucia Blind Welfare Association proved to be
 great allies.
</p>
<p> 
 Once orientation was complete, I began training blind and vision-
 impaired people on the use of JAWS. My clients were extremely
 varied in age, computing experience, visual ability and other factors.
 All of them were eager to learn but some had to overcome their fear of
 computers.
</p>
<p> 
 As time went on, I took a number of individuals into advanced
 computer literacy training and increased the independence of other
 trainees. For example Anthony Avril, director of the SLBWA,
 progressed from having no typing skills to writing documents on the
 computer. This was great for Mr Avril but worried his administrative
 assistant. Happily, in spite of Mr Avril's achievements, Angel Louis
 still has plenty to keep her busy.
</p>
<p> 
 Teaching other people taught me a lot. My first lesson was realising
 that my clients did not share the same level of computer literacy I was
 used to. To avoid losing my students, I had to organise and simplify
 my knowledge into a format that would work for them, a skill I had
 garnered from my training as a human resources generalist with a
 major interest in training and development.
</p>
<p> 
 All around us were constant reminders we were working in a
 developing country. While the expected computer lab was actually the
 kitchen because it had the fewest leaks and the most reliable electricity
 supply, electrical outages were a constant occurrence.
</p>
<p> 
 The infrastructure of St Lucia also leaves much to be desired for a
 vision-impaired person. Very few of the buildings, for example, are
 blind-friendly. The few elevators there are do not have Braille for the
 floor buttons. The sidewalks that do exist, mainly in the capital
 Castries, are continually changing in height, width, and state of repair
 or disrepair. Perhaps the greatest challenge is the storm sewers; open
 ditches of every size, depth and width imaginable.
</p>
<p> 
 All in all, my five months in St. Lucia were great. I watched the
 director of the SLBWA go from not knowing the location of the keys
 on the keyboard to receiving and sending his own email. I was able to
 help nine vision-impaired students learn the basics of computer-use
 and JAWS. My legacy is Magdelane Maxwell, who I trained to use and
 understand JAWS: she now continues training others.
</p>
<p> 
 These small successes stand in stark contrast to the circumstances of
 the great majority of the blind and vision-impaired community on St
 Lucia, which numbers over 2,500 - largely a community of the hidden
 and the ignored. The cause of sight loss is normally glaucoma but the
 outcome is always the same: people will often lose their job and thus
 go from being a contributor to being a lost member of society.
</p>
<p> 
 Fourteen reconditioned Pentium I computers do not go far. They do
 make a difference and offer some hope to people like my former
 students Jasmine, Stashia, Tony and others struggling to access a
 computer and some basic training to use it. But think for just a moment
 of how far and how fast other parts of the world are moving.
</p>
<p> 
 Developing countries like St. Lucia are being left further behind. The
 blind and vision-impaired citizens of these countries are being dumped
 in the storm sewers.
