<h3 id="i71-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Bbc Launches Free Online Web Customisation Resource.</h3>
<p> 
 A free online resource helping people with disabilities to access the
 internet by
 customising their computer, mouse and keyboard to their individual needs has
 been launched by the BBC.
</p>
<p> 
 'My web my way'
 (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/</a>
 ), provides advice in non-technical language on how to use the built-in
 accessibility features of the three main computer operating systems Windows,
 Apple Macintosh and Linux. The resource also provides information on add-on
 assistive technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 The service is aimed at people with sensory, motor, and cognitive
 disabilities
 of all kinds including "those people with minor vision impairments who would
 not consider themselves to have a disability," the site says.
</p>
<p> 
 "We're finding a wider range of people would benefit. The site is designed
 for
 anybody that needs an adjustment in their browser," said Jon Gooday, senior
 consultant at accessibility charity AbilityNet, which helped the BBC develop
 the site based on AbilityNet's own similar online resource 'My computer my
 way'
 ( <a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/myway/">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/myway/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 As part of a plan for future improvements, the site intends to provide
 information in audible format. Feedback from users is encouraged to help
 suggest further improvements.
</p>
<h3 id="i71-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: 'Large Gap' Between Electronic Goods Makers And Users.</h3>
<p> 
 There is still a "very large gap" between manufacturers of electronic
 consumer
 goods and the needs of users with disabilities, delegates heard at last
 month's
 European eAccessibility conference hosted in London by the UK Presidency of
 the European Union.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is clear manufacturers need partnership advice and help to deliver
 requirements," Neil Thomas from the Royal National Institute of the Deaf
 (RNID) told the conference (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur3</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Thomas said that manufacturers, users and standards producers must work
 jointly to improve the accessibility of mainstream electronic goods and
 services
 to combat the frustration experienced by people with a disability when using
 everyday devices such as washing machines and mobile phones. There is also a
 lack of information on product accessibility to disabled users, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Steve Tyler, Senior Strategic Manager for Digital Technology at RNIB, said
 manuals for consumer goods from mobile phones to washing machines must be
 provided in accessible alternative formats. This would be "an easy win" for
 manufacturers, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The conference covered the accessibility of electronic goods and services
 across Europe, setting out an action plan across member states. Countries
 will
 reconvene in two years' time to discuss progress.
</p>
<h3 id="i71-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Irish Charity Opens Centre For Inclusive Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 A new agency offering technology users advice on accessible products and
 services, and bringing them into closer contact with designers and
 developers,
 has been opened by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland (NCBI).
</p>
<p> 
 The NCBI Centre for Inclusive Technology
 ( CFIT - <a href="http://www.cfit.ie/">http://www.cfit.ie/</a>
 ) has launched a web site with information on how people with disabilities use
 technologies and the problems they face, advice for consumers, and guidance
 on the accessibility of web sites and digital formats such as PDF. The
 centre's
 work will cover a broad range of technologies, from accessible cash
 dispensers
 to digital TV and the web, its director Dr Mark Magennis told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Further initiatives planned by the centre, subject to government funding
 being
 released, include a two-year project to improve communication between end-
 users and developers of products and services. "We hope to set up developer
 forums, in a similar way to BrailleNet in France," Magennis said. CFIT also
 hopes to win government support for a smaller project that will explore how
 blogs for blind people can help strengthen communities, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Later this next month the centre will also learn if it has been successful
 in a bid
 for funding from the European Commission to develop metadata for digital TV
 content, as part of the commission's eContentplus programme
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur4</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: New Internet Radio Station For Visually Impaired Listeners.</h3>
<p> 
 Blind internet users have a new source of information and entertainment
 following the launch last month of blueIRIS
 ( <a href="http://www.blueIRIS.info">http://www.blueIRIS.info</a>
 ), a free online radio station for vision-impaired people based in Blackpool,
 Lancashire. The service, launched by Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Society for
 the Blind, aims to deliver programmes reflecting both local and national
 interests.
</p>
<p> 
 The blueIRIS team are in negotiations with publishers to provide content for
 a
 talking books service, with a deal having already been reached to broadcast
 the
 best-selling Dan Brown novel 'The Da Vinci Code'. A more local flavour will
 be provided by the North West Sound Archive, which has donated material on
 the history of the Fylde Coast, including content recorded by BBC Radio
 Lancashire. At present, up to four hours of material is broadcast daily,
 including local news and issues, and a listing service for local events.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can access the service with computers running either Microsoft Windows
 or Apple Macintosh operating systems, and with a broadband connection. The
 blueIRIS service grew out of a pilot project launched earlier this year,
 which
 was tested by 15 users aged between 20 and 80 years old with varying degrees
 of vision and computer literacy.
</p>
<p> 
 The majority of the 150,000 pounds needed for the project has been provided
 by the Lancashire Digital Development Agency, an organisation funded by the
 Northwest Regional Development Agency to promote take-up of broadband.
 Other partners in the project include Blackpool Council, Ultralab, Rural
 Surround and Interface IT Services.

<h3 id="i71-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Hostile Features:</h3>
<p>  Gerald Weichbrodt writes in response to our survey (October issue) which found low accessibility awareness among technology
 suppliers. "The comments regarding accessibility features being offered in a
 cloak and dagger fashion really struck a chord. We are told that our
 population
 is ageing and that visual limitations will be a factor for a larger number
 of
 people. However, if you try to find a modern telephone sporting a host of
 features, usually either the manufacturer has nothing to offer for those of
 us
 who can't see the display, or they used to have one obscure model with such
 features but discontinued it due to lack of interest.
</p>
<p> 
 "Probe a little deeper, and you find that the specialised model was never
 really
 marketed widely. Also, the special model wasn't made available in showrooms,
 so nobody could walk in off the street and try it. It would have to be
 ordered,
 unseen, and probably with a long lead time. How on earth can a product with
 accessibility features succeed if it's produced and marketed in such a way?
</p>
<p> 
 "If accessible products have a track record like this, then that just sets a
 precedent for accessible products not being profitable. Meanwhile, the trend
 is
 away from controls with direct tactile feedback toward visual menus and
 other
 blind-hostile interfaces to the point where it just isn't fun to shop for
 consumer
 gadgetry anymore.
</p>
<p> 
 "I eagerly await the day when accessibility becomes a selling point and not
 just
 an obscure gimmick that nobody takes seriously as a source of market
 advantage."

<h3 id="i71-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Colour Insight:</h3>
<p>  Michael Crossland, Senior Research Optometrist at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London writes in response
 to John Starbuck's request in our last issue for colour vision test sites.
 "The
 Ishihara colour vision test is widely available, even from Amazon.co.uk:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/col1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/col1</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Web-based colour vision tests should be treated with caution as the tests
 are
 invalid unless performed under the correct type of lighting and screens may
 not
 render the colours correctly. The site you link to is also very likely to
 infringe
 copyright.
</p>
<p> 
 "There are many other better colour vision tests available, such as the City
 University test and the Farsworth-Munsell tests. The easiest way to have
 colour
 vision tested efficiently is to ask your local optometrist or university
 school of
 optometry."

<p>  Chris McMillan from Reading in the UK writes in response to Nick Apostolidis's feature on Skype internet telephony,
 published
 in our September issue, which said sound quality is far superior to a normal
 telephone. "I personally would disagree with this," writes Chris. "Much
 depends on the quality of the phone line involved and the person you're
 talking
 to. I am not a telephone expert, but I find the further one is away from a
 large
 town, the poorer the quality of the line.
</p>
<p> 
 "For international calls, 'computer to computer', it will only work on
 another
 computer elsewhere in the world if they have true broadband capability, so
 the
 visually impaired worldwide are not yet able to take advantage of what we
 are
 now beginning to take for granted. I haven't yet rung up anyone on a
 landline
 from Skype outside the UK to test how well it works.
</p>
<p> 
 "There are improvements that could be made. Skype ought to look seriously at
 their font colour for those who use magnification. Sky blue is not the best
 colour for the vision impaired, and would be rubbish for anyone who is blue
 colourblind."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Conference report- UK Presidency eAccessibility conference.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Demand For Accessible Supplyby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 "Would a barman want a fifth of his customers not buying drinks?"
</p>
<p> 
 This was the question posed by Richard Howitt MEP, president of the All
 Party
 Disability Intergroup for the European Parliament, to delegates at last
 month's
 conference on eAccessibility hosted by the UK presidency of the European
 Commission
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur2</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Howitt's point was that a fifth of the population of Europe has a
 disability, but
 member state governments had yet to take a concerted stand to address their
 accessibility needs.
</p>
<p> 
 The event centred around the recently published EU Communication on
 eAccessibility
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur5">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur5</a>
 ), which suggests three "policy actions" for member states to focus on:
 accessibility requirements in public sector procurement, better use of
 existing
 legislation and accessibility certification.
</p>
<p> 
 But Howitt warned governments of the danger of this voluntary approach. "If
 in two years we're going to have another set of studies and a set of
 dialogues,
 you risk losing the confidence of the European Parliament and the citizens
 of
 Europe," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Access to ICTs by people with a disability must be recognised first and
 foremost as a rights issue," said Professor Rodolfo Cattani, board member of
 the European Disability Forum. "Legislation is the best means to support and
 protect the rights of disabled people," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 But before legislation can be considered, the importance of accessibility
 must
 be more firmly grasped by the manufacturers of technology. "Positive
 advances
 in mainstream technology have come about more by chance than an intention
 to meet disabled people's needs. It is still regarded by the ICT industry as
 a
 side issue," Cattani said.
</p>
<p> 
 Delegates heard that by 2030, the over-60 age group will comprise 30 per
 cent
 of Europeans, further increasing the population of people with a disability.
 But
 manufacturers continue to ignore the issue, they heard.
</p>
<p> 
 "For large manufacturers there will be times when the size of the market
 will
 not be big enough to make [accessibility] a business priority," James Page,
 Manager of Radio Regulations at mobile phone company Nokia UK told
 delegates, although he added Nokia would be "foolish" not to consider the
 needs of all consumers.
</p>
<p> 
 And the view of accessibility as a specialist issue may not be restricted to
 the
 technology industry, according to IBM's director of accessibility for Europe
 and the Middle East, Dr Wilfredo Ferre. "From experience talking to
 customers
 in the private sector, when you try to convince them to be accessible, their
 reaction is 'what is accessibility?' They see it as a niche issue."
</p>
<p> 
 The European Commission is set to evaluate the outcome of the proposals laid
 out in its Communication in two years' time and will create new legislation
 "if
 deemed necessary," it says. In the meantime, the answer to increased
 understanding of the importance of accessibility and to speed up wider
 implementation, according to Ferre, is a partnership approach between
 citizens,
 industry and government. And for this, he said, "the industry stands ready
 to
 play its part."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four - TechnologyWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: The Human Touchby Alastair Campbell.
</h3>
<p> 
 The accessibility of a web site can be measured at various stages throughout
 its
 development, against the international World Wide Web Consortium's Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines
 ( WCAG - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/</a>
 ), so it helps to know which accessibility issues are best dealt with at which
 stage.
</p>
<p> 
 The most important stage for accessibility is during template development,
 where the general code that will be produced is decided. These templates
 form
 the foundation from which all the pages on the site will be made, and this
 is
 where the most WCAG checkpoints are accounted for. Tools such as the
 W3C's validator and accessibility tools are useful at this stage, but many
 items
 still require human checks to see what is appropriate.
</p>
<p> 
 The process of integrating accessible templates into a product or system,
 such
 as a content management system (CMS), can be very difficult. Often there are
 times when certain aspects are "hard-coded", so it would involve changing
 how
 a system works to produce valid and accessible code. Occasionally it is not
 possible to replicate templates exactly.
</p>
<p> 
 However, it is vital to check at the end of this stage that the templates
 have
 been integrated successfully. It is best to do a complete accessibility and
 code
 check on a representative sample of pages, and run automated checks on the
 entire site to see if any other errors come up. When templates are used, the
 only
 errors that occur tend to be replicated across many or all pages.
</p>
<p> 
 Once the site has been confirmed as being completely accessible at this
 stage,
 the only thing that can go wrong now is the content. Automated tools will
 check a page for many items, but it is important to understand how much of
 each checkpoint an automated tool can realistically check for.
</p>
<p> 
 Of the 65 WCAG version 1 checkpoints, there are five checkpoints that can be
 fully assessed by an automated process, and which are actually better
 assessed
 automatically. These are checkpoint 3.2, which checks for valid code;
 checkpoint 4.3, which identifies the language of a document; checkpoint 9.1,
 which warns against server-side image maps; checkpoint 11.2, which deals
 with deprecated HTML elements; and checkpoint 12.4, which checks that
 labels are associated with their controls in the code.
</p>
<p> 
 Another eight checkpoints can be partially assessed by automated tools.
 These
 are checkpoint 1.1, where automated tools can check for the existence, but
 not
 for suitability of alternative text; checkpoint 3.4, where the existence of
 non-
 relative units can be confirmed, but not whether they make a difference to
 display; and checkpoints 6.3 and 9.3, which ensure pages work without
 scripts.
 Automated tools can check for scripts, but not whether the page works for a
 user.
</p>
<p> 
 These tools can also help with checkpoint 6.4, which deals with mouse or
 keyboard only scripts, but not whether they actually work for people; and
 checkpoints 7.4 and 7.5, which deal with automatically refreshing or
 redirecting pages. Some of these can be detected with automated tools, but
 there are many possible ways that they may escape detection.
</p>
<p> 
 Checkpoint 13 checks whether link text such as 'click here' is repeated for
 links
 to different pages, or if the same page is linked to by different text.
 However,
 many instances found by checkers do not affect people.
</p>
<p> 
 Automated tools can be used at the pre-launch stage to check across many
 pages, as user-checks have been performed already. However, some things,
 such as relevance of alternative text, will never be machine-checkable.
 These
 issues account for 13 of the 65 checkpoints. The point is that there are
 many
 things that cannot be confirmed by an automated process.
</p>
<p> 
 Once the templates are tried and tested, and the CMS is in full swing, there
 are
 several checkpoints that often come up when a site is reviewed. For example,
 whether links to the same page have different link text; whether links are
 not
 separated; or headings are not nested correctly.
</p>
<p> 
 These are common examples from our experience of relatively minor
 accessibility issues that are often best found by an accessibility testing
 tool that
 'spiders' a site, checking every page within a specified domain. Content
 issues
 such as alternative text have to be checked by people, and training the
 authors
 is the most effective measure.
</p>
<p> 
 Many accessibility issues will be identified during the template stage.
 Working
 to resolve them at this point in the development cycle will prevent more
 resource intensive resolution attempts farther down the line. Quality
 assurance
 and automated tools both play a part in the latter stages of the development
 cycle, but more often than not they will identify issues too late for them
 to be
 resolved satisfactorily.
</p>
<p> 
 Formulating a clear strategy, based on knowing where and when to test for
 accessibility issues, combined with the right tools, the right training and
 a good
 quality assurance process, is the key to a successful development project.
