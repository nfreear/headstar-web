<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i66-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Many Blogs 'Impossible To Access'.</h3>
<p> 
 Internet users with impaired vision often find it impossible to access
 weblogs or 'blogs', the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB -
 <a href="http://www.afb.org/">http://www.afb.org/</a>
) has warned.</p>
<p> 
 Blogs, which are spreading across the internet like wildfire, are online
 publishing systems allowing individuals or groups of people to publish
 journals or snippets of news and others to respond to them to create
 interactive discussion.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem for vision-impaired users is not just that blogs often suffer
 the same kinds of problem that make mainstream sites difficult to use,
 such as a failure to provide descriptions of images or poor page layout,
 says the AFB in a new report
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/afb1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/afb1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Blogs raise additional access barriers of their own, the federation says.
 For example, they often ask users to identify graphics as part of a
 registration process. Originally designed to deflect automated
 spamming software, the process usually requires a user to identify a
 visually distorted word or phrase displayed as an image, but this
 usually means that people with impaired vision cannot register without
 help from a sighted person.
</p>
<p> 
 The widely-used 'Blogger' product became the latest piece of blogging
 software to include these steps in its sign-up process, to the concern of
 many web users (see for example a discussion on
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/blog1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/blog1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The move was criticised because apart from the signing up procedure
 Blogger has won a lot of support because it is easy to use. "It took the
 need for technical knowledge out of blogging, and made it so easy,"
 said Damon Rose, editor of the BBC Ouch online service
 ( <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/</a>
 ), who also runs his own blog BlindKiss
 ( <a href="http://www.blindkiss.com/">http://www.blindkiss.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 As part of its research, AFB has published some tips to make blogs
 easier to use, at:

 .</p>
<h3 id="i66-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Frustrated Consumer Launches Product Review Site.</h3>
<p> 
 A free web site allowing people with impaired vision to submit and
 read reviews of consumer products has been launched by partially
 sighted internet enthusiast Dave Goodwin.
</p>
<p> 
 VIP Consumer (<a href="http://www.vipconsumer.com">http://www.vipconsumer.com</a>
) claims to be the first online service of its kind. It collects feedback from users on how
 accessible and usable products and services are, and provides a forum
 where these issues can be raised and discussed in more depth.
</p>
<p> 
 The service is available in a test version at present, with a full launch
 planned for early August. Goodwin told E-Access Bulletin he decided
 to launch the service after a particularly frustrating experience: "I
 bought a multi-function remote control, the kind with a screen. I found
 it impossible to use because the characters were too small and no
 customisation of the display was possible. I'd read plenty of reviews,
 but none covered the vision aspects, not even the manufacturer's
 information," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The discussion area of VIP Consumer may turn out to be as valuable as
 the individual reviews, Goodwin said. "What do you do if you come to
 the site and a review of the product you're interested in isn't available?
 You can go to the discussion area to raise the issue. I don't want people
 to just leave if they can't find the information they need," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Goodwin has little experience in running an online service, beyond
 setting up web sites for friends, and says he would welcome advice on
 how to gain funding for the service through sponsorship or other
 means, while keeping it free for the users. Readers can contact him on:

<h3 id="i66-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: World'S First Working Group On Accessible Biometrics.</h3>
<p> 
 A European group has been set up to research the potential of
 biometrics - the use of a body part to identify individuals and access
 their personal data -  for people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The Social and Environmental special interest group of the European
 Biometrics Forum (EBF - <a href="http://www.eubiometricforum.com/">http://www.eubiometricforum.com/</a>
 ), which will also look at ethical and usability issues, will have its first meeting
 this Summer.
</p>
<p> 
 Its creation was announced at a recent London conference on
 accessible biometrics
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio4</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done on how
 biometrics could help disabled people," said Will McMeechan, head of
 business futures at Nationwide building society and chair of the new
 group. "I want to try and show biometrics could be useful for people
 with a disability. It could be seen very much as an enabling
 technology."
</p>
<p> 
 The group will also produce best practice guides for creating accessible
 biometric systems, covering areas such as interface design.
</p>
<p> 
 McMeechan said he had conducted a trial at Nationwide that used iris
 scans to identify users of cash machines. "That [system] would be a
 boon to a lot of customers," he said.
</p>
<p>

 Three, this issue.

<p>  Rich Caloggero writes in to respond to Allen Hoffman's April contribution on ways of making 'LeapFrog' tactile

</p>
<p> 
 Rich is an adaptive technology consultant at the Massachusetts
 Institute of Technology's Adaptive Technology for Information and
 Computing laboratory (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/atic/">http://web.mit.edu/atic/</a>
). He writes: "Allen suggests that if the pages of the device were also embossed with raised
 lines, then a blind person could use this system to read maps. The
 problem is that you still need special ink, as the LeapFrog system uses
 special ink and a special pen to "read" pages prepared with this ink.
</p>
<p> 
 "With [Allen's suggested] method, you need to emboss this same page
 with raised lines. But with my approach, it does not take an extra step
 to emboss the figure: all you need is your two hands.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is a Braille printer called the Tiger from ViewPlus
 ( <a href="http://www.viewplus.com/">http://www.viewplus.com/</a>
 ) which can produce raised line drawings and ink print simultaneously.
 Add to this a touch tablet which is a smooth surface which sends
 information about where it is touched to any computer, and you have a
 system which can do the same thing as the LeapFrog, but be
 completely usable by the blind.
</p>
<p> 
 "Using special software called Iveo Creator, also from ViewPlus, you
 can create figures maps, charts or plans, print them out in both print
 and in Braille with the Tiger embosser, and then place the image on the
 touch tablet. When you move your hands over the figure which is
 raised, and press on various spots or within certain areas on the figure,
 relevant information about the image can be spoken via synthesised
 speech. This information can be added when the figure is initially
 created, or added or changed later via Iveo Creator."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b> Section Three - Seminar Report- Accessible Biometrics
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: In The Public Eyeby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 The use of people's physical attributes such as fingerprints, irises,
 DNA or facial features to identify them and access their personal
 information was once the stuff of science fiction.
</p>
<p> 
 But now, with the UK Home Office's plans to deploy ID cards due to
 come to fruition within a decade, biometrics are set to become part of
 daily life. By 2013, everyone in the country will have an ID card that
 uses a biometric to access the information it holds.
</p>
<p> 
 Creating a system that uses a biometric for an entire population means
 considering accessibility on at least two levels: at the moment of
 capturing the biometric and in the design of the reading device.
</p>
<p> 
 There are various potential problems in both areas. The sight loss
 condition Nystagmus, for example, which causes a vibration of the
 eyeball, means it may not always be possible to obtain a "readable"
 image for scanners.
</p>
<p> 
 So it is important to understand the needs of all users, but when
 designing a biometric accessible for all it is vital never to take
 disability statistics at face value, Dr John Gill, RNIB chief scientist,
 told the audience of a recent government-hosted conference on
 accessible biometrics (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio2</a>
). For example, raw statistics do not offer any information about whether or not a task
 could be undertaken in a specific time and context, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 System designers must also bear in mind the various possible
 permutations of disability, Dr Gill said. "If you're talking about
 delivering a service, it's very important to take into account multiple
 impairments. It's anything but a homogenous population," Gill said.
 For example diabetes, the most common cause of vision impairment,
 can also affect circulation, ruling out use of Braille because the sense
 of touch is affected, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 One possible way to enhance the accessibility of biometric readers
 would be to introduce a smartcard on which user preferences such as
 large print; audio information; languages; or fonts could be stored, Gill
 said. This would mean vision-impaired users could have instant access
 to a tailored interface when having their biometric read.
</p>
<p> 
 Another application for biometrics could be bank cash machines
 (ATMs), according to Will McMeechan, business developer at the
 Nationwide Building Society and founder of the independent,
 European Union-backed European Biometrics Forum (EBF -
 <a href="http://www.eubiometricforum.com/">http://www.eubiometricforum.com/</a>
 ). "Many ATMs have cameras built in; the facility is [there] already for facial recognition. We need a
 financial impetus to get this thing working," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Access to data by a biometric would remove the need for people to
 remember or type a pin number or sign a form and would enhance
 security. But there has been doubt over whether systems are
 sufficiently mature to support a system used by everybody.
</p>
<p> 
 "I know a biometric system that couldn't be used because the interface
 wasn't designed properly," McMeechan said. "It was nothing to do
 with the [biometric] technology, it was to do with the way it was
 implemented. There probably isn't enough dialogue going on between
 representative organisations."
</p>
<p> 
 To answer this call, the EBF has recently established a special interest
 group ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ebf1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ebf1</a>
 ) which aims to raise awareness of accessibility and usability issues relating to biometrics
 and address any concerns.
</p>
<p> 
 But accessibility goes even further than registration and identification
 technologies. Peripheral aspects such as customer service must also be
 accessible if a usable card is to be deployed to everyone. "We're
 seriously looking at the internet as a form of interaction," said Henry
 Bloomfield, of the Home Office's technology department. "It provides
 an important channel for people with access or mobility problems," he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Last month, the results were published of a six-month Biometrics
 Enrolment Trial by the UK Passport Service which used 10,000 people
 including 750 people with various disabilities to test facial scanning,
 fingerprint and iris image enrolment
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bio3</a>
). The results will feed into the final design of the national ID card.
</p>
<p> 
 The trial found that for iris scan enrolment, 31 per cent of disabled
 participants found positioning for the recording 'very' or 'fairly'
 difficult. Success rates were around 90 per cent for all participants and
 61 per cent for disabled participants.
</p>
<p> 
 Unsurprisingly, therefore, participants with visual impairment chose
 the fingerprint as their preferred biometric. This had a success rate of
 81 per cent for verification overall and 80 per cent for disabled
 participants.
</p>
<p> 
 There is clearly room for more research and more testing. "Research to
 make biometrics more inclusive may be more important than to
 improve accuracy for "ideal" users," said Tony Mansfield of the
 National Physical Laboratory (<a href="http://www.npl.co.uk/">http://www.npl.co.uk/</a>
).</p>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Technology- JAWS Scripting.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: The Language Of Flexibilityby Nick Apostolodis.
</h3>
<p> 
 Although it is certainly not the cheapest screen reader software on the
 market, JAWS for Windows is considered to be the most powerful and
 flexible text-to-speech converter for home and office computer users.
</p>
<p> 
 One of its main strengths is that JAWS can be adapted to work with
 just about any software on the market and be customised to give
 tremendous power to the blind user.
</p>
<p> 
 Much of this power and flexibility stems from the fact that JAWS has
 its own scripting language. This language is built into the screen reader
 and allows users to write scripts that set the behaviour of JAWS, the
 way it reads, or interacts with other applications.
</p>
<p> 
 A scripting language, like a human language, contains small units. In a
 human language these could be paragraphs, sentences or lines, whereas
 in a scripting language they can be functions or logical operators such
 as 'if' statements.
</p>
<p> 
 So a line of written text like the following:
 "Please read me the current line of text"
 Would be translated in JAWS scripting as:
 SayLine()
</p>
<p> 
 The scripting language can even make decisions based on whether
 something is true or not. For example, you want to tell JAWS to speak
 a help message if an application is running for the first time. Here is
 how:
</p>
<p> 
 if (CalcFirstTime == 0) then
    SayExtendedHelpHotKey ()

 The example above is from a script written for a calculator program. It
 may look a bit complicated for someone that doesn't understand the
 scripting language, but you don't have to know how to write JAWS
 scripts to benefit from them. All you need to know is how to download
 them into the correct folder (the precise location for your scripts will
 depend on which version of JAWS you use); and next time you use the
 application to which they relate, they will run automatically.
</p>
<p> 
 The tool for creating JAWS scripts is called JAWS script manager. It
 can take a source file of text instructions such as the example above
 and create a binary program that JAWS can follow. This procedure is
 called compilation. So you can write your scripts in text, and let the
 script manager compile them for you into instructions that JAWS can
 understand.
</p>
<p> 
 The JAWS help file contains a good scripting manual to get you
 starting to write your first simple scripts, and to help you develop up to
 a fairly advanced level.
</p>
<p> 
 There are also many web sites containing scripts to download, such as
 the Blind Programming site
 <a href="http://www.blindprogramming.com">http://www.blindprogramming.com</a>

 which has a JAWS scripting section where one can find scripts for
 many applications, as well as email lists that discuss JAWS and JAWS
 scripting.
</p>
<p> 
 Another useful resource is the Jaws Lite web site at:
 <a href="http://www.jfwlite.com">http://www.jfwlite.com</a>
 . In the programs section of this site there are numerous popular
 programs along with their JAWS scripts, and also links to other pages
 that offer scripts.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, simply using Google to searching for JAWS scripts will bring
 you more results than you can possibly look at in an afternoon, so if the
 above pages don't satisfy your curiosity that could be your next step!
</p>
<p> 
 So if you are using JAWS and have trouble using a software package,
 the chances are that the answer to your problem is a JAWS script for
 this application. And if after searching you can't find one, why not set
 yourself a challenge to learn the scripting language and write it
 yourself?
