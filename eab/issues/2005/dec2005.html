<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i72-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: European Public Sector Fails On Basic Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Just three per cent of public sector web sites in the European Union
 (EU) reach accepted minimum international standards of accessibility,
 according to UK government-funded research published last month.
</p>
<p> 
 The results were obtained by carrying out automated and manual
 checks on 436 public sector web sites across all 25 member states of
 the EU. The checks were designed to show how well the sites
 measured up to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
 ), that grade sites 'A', 'AA', or 'AAA', in rising order of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the research, only three per cent reached 'A' status,
 although a further 27 per cent narrowly missed out, either because they
 passed all automated checks but failed a manual inspection, or failed a
 small number of automated checks. No sites were found to reach 'AA'
 or 'AAA' status.
</p>
<p> 
 "I had expected and hoped that governments were doing better,"
 accessibility expert Helen Petrie, Professor of Computer Science at the
 University of York, told E-Access Bulletin. "Such a low level of
 conformance is disappointing and shows that we have a mountain to
 climb."
</p>
<p> 
 The report, 'eAccessibility of public sector services in the European
 Union',
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/eur6</a>
 ), was commissioned as part of the UK's presidency of the EU. It
 revealed that few member states know how well they are doing in the
 accessibility field: of the 25, only six felt able to estimate the
 proportion of their web sites meeting 'A' requirements, but all six were
 found to have overestimated.
</p>
<p> 
 The poor showing may partly be explained by the fact that the WCAG
 are not available in all EU languages. At present, the guidelines aren't
 available in the national languages of Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
 Greece, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia; and a number of other minority
 languages. Translations are in progress for the languages of Poland and
 the Slovak Republic.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Pilots For User Preferences Smartcard Go Live In New Year.</h3>
<p> 
 Pilots of a smartcard developed to allow vision-impaired people to
 customise the settings of public electronic terminals including banks'
 automatic telling machines (ATMs) will begin in the new year.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Special needs application programming interface' (SNAPI -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/snapi1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/snapi1</a>
 ) enables smartcards to carry data on user preferences such as a large
 font size, once inserted into an ATM, railway ticket machine or similar
 device.
</p>
<p> 
 "The software can use any existing or planned card scheme. And the
 system could work with any terminal and its screen, subject to
 the supplier using SNAPI specifications," said Geoff Doggett,
 e-services card manager at Mid Suffolk District Council, and SNAPI
 project manager. "Currently, all the accessibility options in Windows
 XP and 2000 [are stored on SNAPI]," Doggett said. "One of the great
 benefits is that simply withdrawing the card resets the computer
 automatically for the next person".
</p>
<p> 
 The pilots will begin in January at libraries in Cambridge and Suffolk;
 at the RNIB resource centre in London; and at several colleges and
 schools. Its developers are also currently creating partnerships with
 terminal suppliers and service providers and looking at ways to make
 the cards available to a larger number of people. Lessons learned from
 the pilots will be disseminated at a workshop in May 2006 where the
 project will be formally launched, Doggett said.
</p>
<p> 
 SNAPI has been developed by the RNIB, Mid Suffolk Council
 and the Black Country Knowledge Society
 ( <a href="http://www.bcks.org.uk/">http://www.bcks.org.uk/</a>
 ), a regional partnership of public, private and voluntary bodies. The
 initiative is managed by the 'Local authority smartcard standards e-
 organisation' (LASSeO -
 <a href="http://www.lasseo.org.uk/">http://www.lasseo.org.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i72-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: 'Podcast' On Assistive Technology For Schools Goes Live.</h3>
<p> 
 A series of monthly online audio broadcasts or 'podcasts,' informing
 teachers, students, parents and administrators on the use of assistive
 technologies in schools and colleges, has gone live.
</p>
<p> 
 The service, entitled Building Educational Success Through
 Technology (BEST -
 <a href="http://bestpodcast.blogspot.com">http://bestpodcast.blogspot.com</a>
 ) provides ideas and resources on assistive technology in education
 including news and product reviews. It can be played online using a
 media player such as 'real player' or 'itunes' or by downloading it onto
 a personal mp3 player, allowing listeners to hear shows at any time
 they choose.
</p>
<p> 
 "Podcasts are an innovative way of providing global access to
 information and are available to anyone who has access to the
 internet," said Brian Wojcik, Coordinator at the Special Educational
 Assistive Technology department at Illinois State University. The
 department collaborated with local education authorities and a
 Chicago-based cerebral palsy charity.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, a 'call for help' feature will be added, Wojcik said. "The aim
 of this is to provide a way for listeners to call in with questions or
 issues they are facing regarding using assistive technology with
 children in early childhood, in secondary classrooms or the home. We
 will attempt to provide answers or provide a forum for others to."
</p>
<h3 id="i72-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Accessibility Accreditation To Use Vision-Impaired Testers.</h3>
<p> 
 A new UK-based system of audit for web accessibility is using a panel
 of testers with disabilities as an integral part of its accreditation
 process.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'See It Right: UseAbility' audit is based on the RNIB's existing
 'See It Right' accessibility audit, in partnership with testers recruited
 by the charity AbilityNet (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/sir1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/sir1</a>
 ). It checks sites against the 'priority areas' of the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines,' from the World Wide Web Consortium
 (W3C).
</p>
<p> 
 "We thought it would be a good idea to get an accreditation going that
 included user testing rather than doing it ourselves and being a
 competitor to See It Right, a popular and worthwhile award," said
 Robin Christopherson, Web Consultancy Manager at AbilityNet.
</p>
<p> 
 "You need disabled testers if you want to make sure there are no
 obstacles to technology such as screen readers," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 For large sites, the panel will comprise eight volunteer testers with
 sensory, motor and learning impairments including three with vision
 impairments to assess sites' compatibility of magnification software,
 screen readers and text options found in browsers.
</p>
<p> 
 Web sites that pass the audit will be entitled to display an audit logo on
 their home page. An unnamed high street insurance company is set to
 be the first to undergo the new scheme, AbilityNet says.
</p>
<p> 
 The disability charity Shaw Trust operates the only other web
 accessibility logo scheme, introduced a year ago, that uses a group of
 disabled web testers
 (<a href="http://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/">http://www.shaw-trust.org.uk/</a>
 ).</p>

<p>  John Nissen, founder of inclusive technology company Cloudworld
 ( <a href="http://www.cloudworld.co.uk">http://www.cloudworld.co.uk</a>
 ) writes in response to Kevin Carey's feature in our October issue on the
 recent EU Communication on accessibility, which he labelled a "waste
 of time."
</p>
<p> 
 Nissen says: "[Carey's] comments set me thinking that what is needed
 is to establish access to information as a basic human right. This would
 open up all sorts of possibilities: taking organisations to the Court of
 Human Rights would be the ultimate recourse.
</p>
<p> 
 "For Europe, we could have something like the US's Section 508,
 whereby "reasonable accommodation" has to be made for access to
 information and services for people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 "One would need to define 'information' as 'information relevant to
 oneself,' [for example:] information for education, health,
 employment, government, voting, financial, legal, and personal data
 held by organisations about oneself. One would need to define 'access'
 as 'equality of access as regards cost and convenience, whatever one's
 age or disability and the information must be made available in a
 timely fashion.
</p>
<p> 
 "Some information would be withheld for security and confidentiality
 reasons, and some information one might have to pay for, but
 otherwise all information should be freely available on a need to know
 basis. Regarding the internet, everybody should have equal access, on
 the assumption that anybody might need to know anything."

<p>  John Starbuck of Wakefield Council in the UK writes in to follow up his query in our October issue about web-based
 colour-blindness tests. He says: "My main concern at present is to find
 a good source to direct web page designers towards, so they can
 appreciate the problems. All too often, they tend to think that including
 more text than images and ensuring the text can be enlarged will
 suffice to deal with vision problems, but I need to show that more has
 to be done.
</p>
<p> 
 "The Web Accessibility guides don't seem to cover colour-blindness
 very well, although I believe cyan is recommended for backgrounds."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Techshare Report I- A DAISY Browser.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Electronic Books - Online And On Demandby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 Many barriers stand between vision-impaired people and accessible
 books, delegates heard at this year's Techshare conference, the RNIB's
 flagship access technology event
 ( <a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Piotr Brzoza and Ryszard Winiarczyk of the Silesian University of
 Technology in Poland
 (<a href="http://www.polsl.pl/">http://www.polsl.pl/</a>
), demonstrated how new browser technology might help overcome some
 of these barriers.
</p>
<p> 
 A very small proportion of all books published are provided in formats
 such as Braille, because of the high cost of doing so and the relatively
 small market for them, said Brzoza. Electronic formats such as cassette
 tape made talking books easier to produce and to market, leading to a
 great increase in the availability of accessible material. The arrival of
 digital technologies promised another leap forward, but progress has
 been slower than expected for several reasons, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Manufacturers of desktop software have developed so-called e-book
 formats, enabling vision-impaired people to access books on a range of
 devices such as dedicated e-book players, home computers and palm-
 top computers. However, these formats are usually the property of the
 software companies, and are often incompatible with each other.
</p>
<p> 
 In response, during the 1990s work began on an open, standards-based
 alternative known as the Digital Accessible Information System
 (DAISY -
 <a href="http://www.daisy.org/">http://www.daisy.org/</a>
 ). The same period witnessed the explosion of content on the internet,
 and efforts to develop assistive technology such as screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 But both DAISY and screen readers have their limitations, delegates
 heard. So-called Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems -
 technologies designed to prevent illegal copying of material - can also
 prevent screen readers accessing digital content. On the other hand,
 although DAISY technology is widely praised for its accessibility, it
 needs complete files to be downloaded to a computer hard drive or a
 compact disc before the content can be read.
</p>
<p> 
 "Downloading an entire book is time-consuming, particularly for
 people who want to use a library to access a large number of books on
 a particular topic, for example," said Brzoza.
</p>
<p> 
 To remedy this problem, Brzoza, Winiarczyk, and their colleagues at
 the Silesian University of Technology built a content management
 system and a web browser that can access content in the DAISY
 format over the internet, as and when the user requests it. The team
 have since used the technology to access the library catalogue and
 books at the Laski School for the Blind in Poland
 ( <a href="http://www.laski.edu.pl/">http://www.laski.edu.pl/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 "It can play books online, it works with the library multimedia system,
 and it provides useful DAISY functions like bookmarks and notes in
 the text," said Brzoza. The browser component can be downloaded for
 free at the Key Foundation web site
 ( <a href="http://www.key.org.pl">http://www.key.org.pl</a>
 ), he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Many delegates wanted to know more. Did the system enable many
 users to access the same content at the same time? Did it allow readers
 to skip text like a standard DAISY player? Yes, it could do both these
 things, said Brzoza. Some delegates wanted to know how expensive it
 would be to install the system. He explained that although the browser
 is available free, there would have to be a charge for using the content
 management system.
</p>
<p> 
 The presentation attracted a great deal of interest, as a practical
 example of how DAISY technology can be adapted for online content.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Free Learning Blended With Treacleby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 A unique online training resource bank to help blind and vision-
 impaired people use mobile phones was unveiled at this year's RNIB
 Techshare conference by a team from Harrow Council in London.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'blended learning' package combines classroom-based learning
 with online learning, and teaches people how to use software to make
 the phone talk for phoning and text messaging, plus other software that
 can magnify the screen. A prototype version of the online learning
 module plus full classroom notes to enable other learning providers to
 deliver all parts of the course will be made freely available on the web
 by Christmas, Harrow Adult and Community Learning Programme
 Development Officer Karen Bhamra told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "We've created a resource bank aimed at tutors, with all the resources,
 lesson plans and so on that you need to run a course," Bhamra said.
 "There is also an e-learning element, with tests."
</p>
<p> 
 When complete, the resource will be made available on the web at:
 <a href="http://www.learninharrow.org.uk">http://www.learninharrow.org.uk</a>

 by following the link to 'Online Courses'. The project was made
 possible by funding from the enticingly named Project TrEACL
 (pronounced 'treacle'), which stands for Technology to Enhance Adult
 and Community Learning. Some 23 projects across England have been
 funded in round three of this programme, including the Harrow work
 (see <a href="http://www.aclearn.net/display.cfm?page=951">http://www.aclearn.net/display.cfm?page=951</a>
 for more on TrEACL).
</p>
<p> 
 Alex Hills, chair of the Middlesex Association for the Blind which has
 partnered with Harrow on the project, said the project had begun by
 some work with a focus group of people with impaired vision, to select
 a preferred mobile phone handset to use in the training course.
</p>
<p> 
 The group looked at a few models and eventually selected the Nokia
 3230 handset to use with Mobile Speak talking phone software. "There
 are a number of handsets that we could have used - they just need to
 run the Symbian phone operating system - but we felt as a group that
 the 3230 was the most tactile, with an easy layout," Hills said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Personally I find the 'clear' and 'edit' keys a bit hard to use, and if
 you've never used a mobile phone before it takes a while, but you do
 get familiar with it. And a range of users generally found the 3230 was
 the easiest to use."
</p>
<p> 
 The next step was to test and evaluate some draft classroom and web-
 based training materials, with sample lessons. All training in Harrow
 has been offered free of charge to learners, using volunteers for the
 teaching.
</p>
<p> 
 The Mobile Speak software package for mobile phones was purchased
 for the course from Optelec
 (<a href="http://www.optelec.co.uk">http://www.optelec.co.uk</a>
), part of the Tieman Group which is the exclusive distributor of the
 software in Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. As
 well as English, Mobile Speak is available to buy and download in
 Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian,
 Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish Swedish and Turkish. The screen
 magnifier used in the lessons is Mobile Magnifier, also from Optelec.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is a point in loading Mobile Speak onto a phone where users do
 need sighted assistance," Hills said. "It's unfortunate but it's a fact. But
 the training documents including the schemes of work and lesson plans
 are available in accessible text files."
</p>
<p> 
 Louise Hamilton, Outreach Tutor at the Harrow learning centre, said
 the Harrow team had learned some important lessons in developing
 training courses for people with impaired vision in previous work they
 had done developing training materials for people in using the Book
 Courier electronic book reader.
</p>
<p> 
 "For example, it is vital in a class not to have two people talking at
 once in a room, for example with more than one working group: only
 one person must talk at a time, with the others listening.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is also important to explain what you are going to do first at each
 stage, and then do it, as people cannot pick up visual clues. The focus
 group sessions were also useful in helping to pick up on technical
 words that some people couldn't understand."
</p>
<p> 
 It is also important to start each lessons with a reminder of the basics,
 Hamilton said. "Every lesson at the start we do familiarisation so the
 learners remember where the keys are," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Future plans include some videoing of learners as they move on from
 the lessons to going out into the real world of the high street mobile
 phone shop and try to buy a handset and download Mobile Speak for
 themselves, she said. "We needed to have some evidence to show our
 funders the work has been successful, so we are asking learners if they
 are going to buy a phone if they could video the process."
</p>
<p> 
 Other plans include working with mobile phone dealers and
 manufacturers to disseminate the fruits of their work, Hills said. "We
 hope to work in partnership with the main dealers and manufacturers to
 see if we can include our training material at the point of sale," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The courses will help people use their phones, including SMS text
 messaging, but it was not really possible to access much information
 on the web yet over a mobile, Hills said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Access to the web using a mobile phone is still in its infancy - there is
 a bit of hype but not a lot people are doing it," he said. "Web site
 owners need to design their sites so it can be accessed by a mobile, like
 the BBC's mobile site
 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile">http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile</a>
 . But it will be better developed in future."
