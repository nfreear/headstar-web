<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i62-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Organisations Join To Create Free It Support Helpline.</h3>
<p> 
 A new partnership between two charities looks set to boost the levels
 of IT support and accessibility advice available to disabled computer
 users.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/</a>
), which provides advice, training and assessments of computer needs for disabled people, has
 joined forces with ITCH Network (<a href="http://www.itcanhelp.org.uk/">http://www.itcanhelp.org.uk/</a>
), a volunteer programme within the British Computer Society
 (<a href="http://www.bcs.org/bcs/">http://www.bcs.org/bcs/</a>
), to provide free IT support to disabled people across the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 The charities have created a single helpline for computer-related
 enquiries (0800 269545) and are pooling their resources and expertise
 to offer a more comprehensive service to end users.
</p>
<p> 
 "While ITCH volunteers tend to help disabled people in their homes
 with everyday problems, such as installing and upgrading software,
 getting started on the internet and combating viruses, AbilityNet's
 consultants can provide individual assessments of computer needs and
 advice on assistive technologies," says Tom Mangan, vice-chairman of
 ITCH Network. "This means that when our volunteers recognise that a
 more complex solution to a client's computer access problems is
 required, they can refer to the client to AbilityNet."
</p>
<p> 
 AbiltyNet will also provide specialist training for ITCH Network
 volunteers to help them solve simple access problems. For example,
 ITCH volunteers could help a vision-impaired person adjust operating
 systems settings to aid magnification or help them with keystroke
 shortcuts for magnification software.
</p>
<p> 
 ITCH currently has some 250 volunteers in the UK and a significant
 proportion of its enquiries come from blind and vision-impaired users.
 Demand for its services is currently growing at 25 per cent a year and
 so it views the link-up with AbilityNet as a way of boosting service
 coverage.
</p>
<h3 id="i62-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Democratic Picture Icons For Low-Vision Users.</h3>
<p> 
 An online resource to help local councils equip web sites with picture
 icons to help users with low vision is to launch in March, in a bid to
 improve access to local democracy.
</p>
<p> 
 The icons will be made available as part of the four million pound
 government-funded national project for local e-democracy. When the
 project's site goes live, it will be at: <a href="http://www.e-democracy.gov.uk">http://www.e-democracy.gov.uk</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 According to their developer Community Living
 (<a href="http://www.communityliving.org.uk/">http://www.communityliving.org.uk/</a>
), the new picture icons will be easier to identify and more meaningful than the buttons, bars and links
 which are usually used to aid web site navigation. The icons can be
 displayed in a range of image formats with tags for screen readers
 users, and in a Flash version with audio output, said team leader
 Andrew Holman.
</p>
<p> 
 The project will also provide councils with good practice guidelines,
 including tips on producing text that is easy to read and understand.
 Clearer and simpler communication from government would benefit
 everyone, said Holman. "It's possible to express quite complicated
 ideas using these techniques. For example, a report for Parliament on
 learning and disabilities was presented in an 'easy read' format that
 even government lawyers were happy with," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 id="i62-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Talking Tactile Device For Educational Diagrams.</h3>
<p> 
 A device that uses touch and sound to allow vision-impaired students
 of all ages to "read" educational graphics and text will go on the
 market next month.
</p>
<p> 
 The Talking Tactile Tablet, or "T3" (<a href="http://talktab.org/">http://talktab.org/</a>
), allows students to "read" maps, diagrams and other images made up of
 embossed sheets with raised lines and areas, placed on top of a reader
 similar in size to a laptop computer. When symbols and regions on the
 tactile surface are pressed, audio information on these images is spoken
 to the user.
</p>
<p> 
 Tactile diagrams have been developed before, but the developers of the
 new system claim it has a uniquely sophisticated sound indexing and
 navigation system. For example, if a student wants to locate a feature
 on a map without knowing where it is, he or she can make a request
 and then place a finger anywhere on the device's surface, before being
 guided by speech to the desired location.
</p>
<p> 
 The T3 has been developed by the Royal National College for the
 Blind (RNCB - <a href="http://www.rncb.ac.uk">http://www.rncb.ac.uk</a>
) with Anglia Polytechnic University (<a href="http://www.apu.ac.uk/">http://www.apu.ac.uk/</a>
) and US assistive devices company Touch Graphics (<a href="http://www.touchgraphics.com/">http://www.touchgraphics.com/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Project manager Lesley Wells said the device could potentially be used
 by students with dyslexia, early years learners or students with a print
 disability. Discussions are underway with the Qualifications and
 Curriculum Authority (QCA - <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/">http://www.qca.org.uk/</a>
) to allow its use in exams.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNCB has developed 30 sets of diagram sheets on various topics
 including the skeleton, nursery rhymes and a world atlas and intends to
 cover all UK National Curriculum topics to assist mainstream
 schooling for all children. The device costs 600 pounds, with sets of
 sheets costing 10 to 20 pounds.
</p>
<h3 id="i62-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: First Accessible Strategy Game To Launch.</h3>
<p> 
 What is claimed to be the first accessible strategy game for blind and
 vision-impaired people has been launched by the Israeli accessible
 gaming specialist VIP Games Zone (<a href="http://www.vipgameszone.com/">http://www.vipgameszone.com/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Strategy games are war-games involve the role-playing of opposing
 armies or forces on a grid-based map. Galaxy Ranger
 (<a href="http://www.vipgameszone.com/granger/granger.php">http://www.vipgameszone.com/granger/granger.php</a>
) is set in space, and gamers can play against the computer or online with a friend.
</p>
<p> 
 The online version includes a "text messenger" feature, allowing
 gamers to communicate with each other during the game. The
 messages can be converted to speech using the KeySpeak SAPI voice
 engine (<a href="http://www.portset.co.uk/keyspeaksapivoice.htm">http://www.portset.co.uk/keyspeaksapivoice.htm</a>
) or a screen reader.
</p>
<p> 
 Galaxy Ranger - which runs on Windows - is the eighth accessible
 game from VIP Games Zone. "The idea behind all our games is that
 you don't need the help of a sighted person to play them," says the
 company's founder Igor Kmiletzof. "We want to make all of the types
 of games currently available on the mainstream market accessible to
 blind and visually impaired people. We launched Super Tennis last
 year, the first accessible online sports game, and now we've launched
 the first accessible online strategy game."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Focus- European Centre for Accessible Media.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Raising The Barby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 "Digital broadcasting is the only serious way of improving the lives,
 options and knowledge of half of the population.
</p>
<p> 
 This was the view of accessibility campaigner Kevin Carey, discussed
 last month by a group of interested parties gathered in London for the
 launch of Carey's plan to establish a new European Centre for
 Accessible Media (ECAM).
</p>
<p> 
 The plan has been drawn up under the remit of Carey's fellowship
 awarded by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the
 Arts (NESTA - <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/">http://www.nesta.org.uk/</a>
). The fellowship, of almost 73,000 pounds over 20 months from January
 2004, is designed to advance the development of digital broadcasting
 to improve access to information, particularly for people with a
 disability and the elderly
 (<a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/ourawardees/profiles/4067/index.html">http://www.nesta.org.uk/ourawardees/profiles/4067/index.html</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Under Carey's proposals, if ECAM is set up it is likely to be a hub for
 providing accessibility resources, sharing best practice; establishing
 technical standards; promoting accessibility legislation and good
 practice; and undertaking training and research in accessible media.
</p>
<p> 
 "It will be interested in all forms of digital information, including web
 accessibility, even if it is most sharply focused on television," said
 Carey, who also sits on the advisory board of the broadcasting
 regulator Ofcom.
</p>
<p> 
 Carey feels strongly that the future of accessible media will be found in
 digital television rather than the web. However, the current background
 of European broadcasting regulation is a "cartel model," he says,
 although it is starting to break down.
</p>
<p> 
 "Whatever the variety of regimes, television regulation holds out the
 best prospect for providing most of our people with information which
 is as accessible as it can be," Carey said. "I do not think that the
 regulatory framework will last. All the more important, then, to get
 people so accustomed to factoring in accessibility to production
 budgets that it becomes unquestioned, good practice."
</p>
<p> 
 One of his visions for ECAM is that it becomes a centre for best
 practice in broadcasting access services: subtitling, signing and audio
 description - an area, according to Carey, that needs a lot more work.
</p>
<p> 
 In terms of funding for the centre, one attendee, Helen Petrie, professor
 of human computer interaction at City University, suggested raising
 funds from the production of accessible media.
</p>
<p> 
 If, however, ECAM did not make a profit from this - and he specified
 that the centre would not undercut other commercial operators - it
 would need to raise revenue from ECAM members and other European
 organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 Petrie said while awareness of web accessibility issues has heightened,
 there are still major gaps in knowledge. This has been highlighted by
 the findings of a Department of Culture, Media and Sport initiative
 with which she is involved, aimed at training young web developers in
 accessibility issues, she said. "They all know about web accessibility
 and have looked at Web Accessibility Initiative standards, but they
 don't understand the relationship between following standards and
 using a web site," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 With that in mind, Petrie suggested that a new European centre could
 play an educational role: "It could provide training to web developers,"
 she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Carey envisages that support for ECAM would come from the
 European Union, the European Broadcasting Union
 (<a href="http://www.ebu.ch/en/index.php">http://www.ebu.ch/en/index.php</a>
) and the Council of Europe (<a href="http://www.coe.int/">http://www.coe.int/</a>
). A small, core staff would be seconded from broadcasters, producers, regulators, academics and the voluntary
 sector.
</p>
<p> 
 It is early days, and the seeds of Carey's plan are only beginning to
 sprout. During his "voyage," as he calls it, he has already learned a lot:
 for example, he has found the contrast between the world of computing
 and the world of broadcasting striking.
</p>
<p> 
 "Computing is like the wild west. In accessibility terms you have the
 messy paraphernalia of the World Wide Web Consortium with its
 accessibility initiative, WAI. It can command a certain degree of
 industry participation, but when the standard is delivered it is up to
 national governments to decide what they will do.
</p>
<p> 
 "In the case of broadcasting the opposite procedure applies. There is no
 government on earth that does not want to regulate broadcasting,"
 Carey said.
</p>
<p> 
 The centre could potentially become a European centre for creating
 accessibility standards in this area but the plans are still setting. "The
 key decision we will have to take is whether ECAM, like its North
 America cousin the National Centre for Accessible Media (NCAM -
 <a href="http://ncam.wgbh.org/">http://ncam.wgbh.org/</a>
) should be a producer of accessible material or whether it should simply be a high level body," said Carey. Later this
 year he will visit NCAM to gather information.
</p>
<p> 
 "There may be a number of broadcasters, particularly in small or
 applicant countries, which want ECAM to produce and modify
 material but a majority of ECAM's members, being commercial
 operations, may vote to stop ECAM's production work so that it is
 divided between them."
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the goal is to boost accessibility across Europe, Carey said.
 "The diversity of the European situation [calls] for the establishment of
 standards to which all can aspire, so that the bar in every aspect of
 production and transmission is steadily raised."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Gaming- Multi-User Dungeons (MUDS).
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: In A World Of Fantasy, Anything Can Happenby Gabriele Battaglia.
</h3>
<p> 
 Are many readers of E-Access Bulletin familiar with MUDS, I
 wonder? It would take a long time to explain everything about MUDS,
 which is short for 'Multi-User Dungeons': what they are, how to join
 them and how to explore them. But even a brief introduction should be
 enough to rouse your curiosity and to start some of you off on the road
 to playing these beautiful games.
</p>
<p> 
 There are many MUDS. Many of these are completely accessible to
 blind people, if the proper software is used. Some of them can be found
 on several different platforms, specifically the ones which are
 completely text-based such as Ancestral, the MUD I'm playing at the
 moment.
</p>
<p> 
 MUDS are whole worlds in themselves. They have cities, forests,
 lakes, roads, bridges, caves, inns, palaces, villages, deserts, hills and
 mountains. They also feature a series of fantastic places, depending on
 the chosen MUD and its temporal location. Most of them are located in
 a "swords and sorcery" medieval period, in the style of the Lord of the
 Rings. Also the inhabitants are more or less the same, being creatures
 such as dwarves, humans, elves, fairies, giants and dragons, plus the
 different crossbreeds and other much rarer and hidden creatures like
 vampires, angels, half-gods, devils and more.
</p>
<p> 
 When we enter a MUD, we play the part of one of these characters,
 created by us according to our requirements as players or just
 according to our fantasy.
</p>
<p> 
 Characters must grow up and become strong, and possibly also rich
 and respected, avoiding all the dangers of their lives. They will have
 money, and skills that will increase by practising them. They will have
 friends to protect and enemies to fight, or to escape from. They must
 buy and sell, establish alliances and make agreements, or become part
 of a group in order to be protected. They will have to develop as a
 person, by learning trades or magic arts; in other words, they must
 accumulate experiences.
</p>
<p> 
 In Ancestral, for example, the quantity of a character's experiences is
 expressed by a score. When the player builds up experiences, his or her
 score increases and at a certain point he or she will reach a new level.
 Every level gives new skills and abilities, new powers and spells and
 upgrades those already possessed. The MUD game starts at level 1 and
 ends at level 50, when your character has become an avatar: practically
 a god.
</p>
<p> 
 The great thing is that the game is never the same, because it is played
 in an ever-changing community. There are many characters managed
 by the computer, or NPCs (Not Playing Characters), who have
 schematic behaviours, but lots of other characters are being controlled
 by other real people who play their parts, as on a stage. Therefore
 anything can happen, and anything can change.
</p>
<p> 
 Why not give it a try?
</p>
<p> 
 First of all, you have to prepare your computer. All Windows systems
 are supported. You must download a client that works properly on a
 MUD server, such as GMUD32 version 1.9, and users of the JAWS
 screen reader must also download its JAWS scripts. These scripts are a
 real touch of genius because they have unusual power and
 functionality. The right version of the scripts we need is the last
 released version, V 7.0. Both GMUD32 and its scripts can be found in
 the 'Program and Script Downloads' area of the accessible technology
 site GutterStar.net (<a href="http://www.gutterstar.net">http://www.gutterstar.net</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The GMUD software is completely free, while the scripts are
 shareware (with a time limit); after 35 minutes, they actually lose some
 of their advanced functions, although the most important ones can still
 be used, and they are all you will need to play.
</p>
<p> 
 After installing GMUD32 and its scripts, we are ready to go online and
 to enter this beautiful and fantastic world. And if, like me, you read
 Italian, you can even try out my own game. All you have to do is to
 open GMUD32, select "connect" from the file menu and fill in the
 fields as follows: Host address of the MUD: italcomp.net, MUD Port:
 4000. Ignore the other fields and buttons for now.
</p>
<p> 
 When you have typed OK, and possibly authorised GMUD to connect
 by your firewall, you will be online and Jaws will read you all that you
 have to do. Now you can start creating your character.
</p>
<p> 
 When you are there, remember that the keyword "WHO" will show
 you the list of players who are connected to the game in that moment.
 My character is a magician and his name is Nishu. If you are joining
 my game, I'll be waiting there for you online!
