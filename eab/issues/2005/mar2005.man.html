<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Special Notice: Last chance to book a place for Vision 2005- 4 to 7 April 2005, London.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 Advances in technology and designing for an inclusive environment
 will be key themes at Vision 2005, the world's biggest ever conference
 on sight loss. The latest in accessible information, e-learning, web
 sites, multimedia and reading through technologies will be included in
 the four-day event's 600 presentations, workshops and debates.
</p>
<p> 
 Keynote speakers include access technology pioneer Dr Raymond
 Kurzweil, who will be "teleporting" himself to the conference from the
 US to deliver his address on "The future of blindness and disabilities in
 an age of accelerating technology".
</p>
<p> 
 Vision 2005 is hosted by RNIB and takes place at London's Queen
 Elizabeth II Conference Centre. For more information see:

<h3 id="i63-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Guidelines Place Inclusive Design On Boardroom Table.</h3>
<p> 
 A new standard aimed at ensuring inclusive design becomes a high-
 level strategic priority for organisations, not a low-level technical
 issue, was published this month by the British Standards Institute
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bsi1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bsi1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Unlike accessibility guidance for designers, which tends to focus on
 specific products or services, the new standard and accompanying
 practical guidelines support managers who need to make inclusive
 design part of the overall aims of an organisation, whether it be a small
 manufacturer, a multinational corporation or a government department.
</p>
<p> 
 "When people think about design they often think of the creative
 aspect, but there's plenty of evidence to show that managers have a
 greater impact than the creative people. Managers identify the
 problems to be solved, and how to tackle them," said Alan Topalian,
 chair of the panel that drafted the standard.
</p>
<p> 
 Many organisations will only take inclusive design more seriously to
 avoid falling foul of legislation such as the Disability Discrimination
 Act, but there are more positive reasons for doing so, Topalian told E-
 Access Bulletin. "Taking inclusive design seriously can open up a
 large potential market," he said. "Many companies only go for the 18
 to 35 age group, which is nonsense when you think about increasing
 'grey power'".
</p>
<p> 
 For Topalian, there was also a personal inspiration for the development
 of a new high-level standard. "My wife specialised in working with
 older people for Lewisham Council, so it's an issue that was discussed
 at home. [The council's chief executive] Barry Quirk once said . . . it
 should be a priority to design in diversity, and design out inequality."
</p>
<h3 id="i63-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Californian Digital Library "Incredibly Popular."</h3>
<p> 
 An online library service that allows users to download e-books to
 mobile technology devices for free has been launched in California -
 by a consortium of seven public libraries.
</p>
<p> 
 Since the 'Califa' system (<a href="http://califa.lib.overdrive.com/">http://califa.lib.overdrive.com/</a>
) launched in mid-February, there have been almost 1,700 "checkouts" by users who
 are able to download audio books and e-books online.
</p>
<p> 
 Downloads of e-books and digital audio books can be downloaded
 onto mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs); mobile
 phones; laptops and mp3 players. "We didn't know what to expect
 [but] it's been incredibly popular," said Anthony Costa, operations
 manager of Califa. An additional order for more titles has been placed
 due to high demand. "The only complaint so far is that they are not
 compatible with iPods," Costa said.
</p>
<p> 
 Books are downloadable by chapter which according to Costa "Enables
 more usability on slower connections and facilitates burning" and
 readers can be directed to the last page read. Normal loan periods of 21
 days apply to the service with loans automatically checked back in
 when the loan period expires. The service uses technology from e-book
 distributor Overdrive (<a href="http://www.overdrive.com/">http://www.overdrive.com/</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i63-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: New Web Standards Star At Csun.</h3>
<p> 
 New standards for accessible web sites took centre-stage at CSUN
 2005, the annual international conference that highlights developments
 in access technology, hosted last week by California State University
 Northridge (<a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/2005/genconfinfo05.htm">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/2005/genconfinfo05.htm</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 An overview of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, the new
 global standard due to be published later this year, was presented by its
 developers, the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility
 Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
). Delegates heard how content publishers can adapt to the new standard, and how to test their web
 sites for compliance.
</p>
<p> 
 Among the many new products on display, accessible handheld
 devices with wireless capabilities attracted much attention. There was a
 demonstration of Maestro, claimed to be the first off-the-shelf portable
 digital assistant (PDA) for the blind and now integrated with the
 Trekker GPS satellite location system. The product's manufacturer is
 HumanWare, the company formed from the recent merger of access
 technology firms VisuAide and Pulse Data. Delegates were shown how
 to link the PDA to other devices using the Bluetooth wireless standard,
 and to the web through Wi-Fi networks.
</p>

 <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i63-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Bank Statement:</h3>
<p>  Several readers wrote in to respond to Fay Rohrlach from Australia who, in our last issue, urged banks to issue
 account statements in alternative and electronic formats. Jenny Finch
 from Brisbane, Australia, said: "The Commonwealth Bank sends all
 my statements in Braille, and Telstra sends Braille bills to me. It's
 lovely to just open and read them straight off, independently and
 nobody else knows what's in them!"
</p>
<p> 
 And Peter Catchpole writes: "I too am vision impaired and my bank,
 the Alliance and Leicester, have been supplying me with large print
 correspondence and documentation for some time. They also provide
 an online banking system where customers are able to manage their
 accounts, for example they can view statements, amend or cancel
 standing orders or transfer funds between accounts, both internally and
 to and from other banks.
</p>
<p> 
 "In the UK there is legislation intended to ensure equal access to goods
 and services by all disabled persons. It is up to us, vision-impaired
 people, to ensure that we continually press for the implementation of
 this legislation. At the end of the day, vote with your feet where this is
 possible. Even government departments require chivvying."
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile Sam Latif from Surrey would like to broaden the debate: "I
 would like to get peoples' thoughts on service providers for the blind
 who continue to send paper-based invoices to blind people rather than
 emailing them. Companies include RNIB and Cobalt systems. Can we
 not try, as a group, to get them to start emailing such things? Is there
 anything you can do?" She adds: "I did contact RNIB to tell them that
 they provided inaccessible invoicing. They thanked me for making
 them aware and said they will have a solution in six months' time - that
 is a poor excuse as the Disability Discrimination Act has been out
 since 1995! Frustrated and disappointed, Sam." [Please send further

<h3 id="i63-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Google Views:</h3>
<p>  Allen Hoffman from the Section 508 project at the US Internal Revenue Service writes to respond to a contribution by
 Katherine Schneider published last issue about the digital library
 initiative from search engine Google, 'Google print'
 (https://print.google.com/publisher/).
</p>
<p> 
 "I recently corresponded with the director of the 'print.google.com'
 effort, and was pleasantly surprised that he understood the need for
 more than image access of the materials. I urged them to work with
 'bookshare.org' as a starting point to making image-formatted data
 available for the vision impaired. Having the images is half the battle,
 applying optical character recognition to those is the next step."
</p>
<p> 
 Hoffman has further comments to make about Google's email service,
 'gmail': "It is an accessibility nightmare. I am disappointed in the
 extreme in this product from a company that should be able to produce
 better products. If you change the view in gmail from HTML to basic,
 you can then use the "compose message" and other options. To
 activate the strangely coded links, you can with JAWS use the mouse
 cursor and mouse keys to simulate clicking on the links and get things
 started. But this is a tremendously annoying amount of effort to put in.
 You also can't set the system to come up in basic mode when you log
 in, you have to set it by mouse-clicking the word "basic" each time you
 log in.
</p>
<p> 
 "I suppose it is free, but still, [this is] not a goodwill generator for the
 blind. One person on the net has made the analogy of this to tripping
 blind people on the street for fun and I'd agree with that! If Google, a
 premier technology company, can't do simple accessibility, then what
 are the others going to be expected to produce?" [Please send further

 gone to comply with the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines
 and how this translates into ease of use by their vision-impaired online
 customers.
</p>
<p> 
 "I need participants who are willing to answer a short questionnaire
 about their surfing habits, then carry out an online shopping exercise
 on their own and then, if they wish to, have a chat with me over the

<h3 id="i63-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: A Game Of Snakes And Ladders, by Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 The end of this year marks the deadline for UK local authorities to
 make all their services available in electronic formats, in most cases
 over the web. But how accessible will these services be?
</p>
<p> 
 The annual 'Better connected' review of all 468 UK council web sites
 was published last month by the council IT management body Socitm
 (<a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk/">http://www.socitm.gov.uk/</a>
). The review focuses on site usability and provides an insight into the quality of experience the public have when
 interacting with local government online.
</p>
<p> 
 As part of the review process, this year the RNIB checked all the sites
 against the standards of web accessibility specified by the international
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The report found 62 sites achieve level 'A' conformance, a substantial
 improvement on last year, when only 18 reached this first basic level.
 However, it was cause for concern that, of those original 18, only eight
 maintained the achievement. Ten councils have slipped back and 54
 councils have moved up - "A game of snakes and ladders indeed!" in
 the words of the report.
</p>
<p> 
 Some common problems were noted by the team. Many web sites
 slipped back this year because they omitted ALT text tags for images.
 Indeed, the survey says 40 per cent of all sites fail this basic test.
 However, this is an improvement on last year's report which found 55
 per cent of sites failed on that point.
</p>
<p> 
 The report team detected widespread confusion over the application of
 accessibility rules, which it attributed to four factors: a lack of a single
 accreditation body for local government WAI compliance; a lack of
 clarity over the WAI checkpoints themselves; accessibility testing tools
 that each test different criteria; and web developers that fail to realise
 that both automatic and manual tests are absolutely necessary for a
 council site to claim full WAI compliance.
</p>
<p> 
 "The fact that 10 sites have slipped back, having reached high
 standards before, shows the importance of ongoing testing and
 maintenance of a site," the report said. "Achieving level A compliance
 is only the start."
</p>
<p> 
 Geographical trends were spotted for those sites passing level 'A'
 accessibility checks. In terms of types of council, shire areas do
 marginally better than elsewhere with 18 per cent of counties and 17
 per cent of districts meeting the standard.
</p>
<p> 
 The Better Connected team found the most striking example of good
 practice is found in Cornwall with five of the six shire districts
 achieving the standard. The South West performs best, most likely
 boosted by the Cornwall figures, with 28 per cent of councils achieving
 level A, followed by the East Midlands, with 21 per cent of councils.
 The lowest performing regions are the North-West with success rates
 of 7 per cent and Yorkshire and Humber with 9 per cent. Only one
 council in Scotland achieved the standard.
</p>
<p> 
 The use of joined-up working to develop web sites has been neglected
 in recent months, the report found, and the Better Connected team
 predicts this situation may remain unchanged. This is attributable to the
 priority outcomes, a set of key targets for electronic service delivery
 for local authorities to attain, which have become "an urgent task," it
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 The report says despite this, "better working together will lead directly
 to efficiency gains as the districts of Cornwall have illustrated in
 achieving high standards of accessibility."
</p>
<p> 
 Another interesting and new part of the report dealing with
 accessibility issues was a review of the state of text-only versions of
 web sites, undertaken for Socitm by web testing company SciVisum
 (<a href="http://www.scivisum.co.uk/">http://www.scivisum.co.uk/</a>
). The goal of this exercise was to inform the ongoing debate as to whether it is good practice to have a separate
 text-only site running parallel to the main graphical site, or whether it
 is better to construct a single fully accessible site - the usual choice of
 accessibility purists.
</p>
<p> 
 The report found that of the 147 text-only sites belonging to UK
 councils, an "overwhelming majority" have problems. Text-only sites
 are being produced so badly in almost all cases that "it must be time to
 take them down altogether and apply resources to making graphical
 sites more accessible," the report found. Web designers have been
 warned.
</p>

<h3 id="i63-12"><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Rising To The Challenge Of Life, by Stephanie Read.
</h3>
<p> 
 Technology has been a great help to me and has been the reason why I
 have managed to complete my education, which is no mean feat
 considering my life events.
</p>
<p> 
 When I was three months old my parents were told I was partially
 sighted. My sight stayed steady until the age of 12 when a problem
 with my macula meant that I lost my sight completely. This upset me,
 but I was at a school for the visually impaired so mobility and Braille
 training was soon in place.
</p>
<p> 
 I was very active and took part in swimming and athletic competitions,
 running and swimming in the B1 category. My favourite activity was
 riding. However, this came to an abrupt end when at the age of 14 I
 started to get spine and hip problems. I was told I was "putting it on"
 and to pull myself together. As the years went on my physical
 disability increased but nobody had the answer to what was wrong.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite my disabilities, I continued my education, going on to achieve
 eight GCSEs, three 'A' levels and one 'AS' level and in October 2000,
 started a psychology degree.
</p>
<p> 
 But in February 2001 things got even worse after I lost all sensation
 and movement below my waist. I spent three-and-a-half months in
 hospital but still no one knew what was wrong. When I came out of
 hospital I wanted to continue my degree and although I was told I
 would have to retake the first year again, I started the first year for the
 second time and passed all 12 modules.
</p>
<p> 
 At the same time things seemed to be getting worse - I was starting to
 have problems with my hands which meant that typing became a
 problem, so I ended up in hospital again having more tests. The doctors
 at Kings College hospital withdrew my drugs, leaving me in agony and
 unable to get out of bed, so we spent the next 18 months trying to get
 my drug regime reinstated.
</p>
<p> 
 But I was not going to let my disability win. During this time I was
 trying to carry on with my degree but because of my health, however
 hard I tried I didn't manage to pass all the second-year degree modules.
 Finally I was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a rare
 condition that affects about one in 10 million.
</p>
<p> 
 This diagnosis meant so much: it gave me the courage to carry on
 fighting. In September this year my medication was reinstated and a
 new computer was bought for me, so that I could continue with my
 university degree. In October 2004 I restarted my second year and plan
 to finish my degree in Summer 2006.
</p>
<p> 
 I have been using laptops and desktop computers for a long time, with
 the JAWS for Windows screen reader. In the last two months I have
 received my new laptop, with JAWS plus the speech recognition
 software J-Say, which means I can now just dictate documents and
 JAWS will read back what the computer has written.
</p>
<p> 
 The internet is also very important to me as lecturers and my enablers
 can email things to me when I'm not well enough to physically get to
 university. It also opens up a huge world of information that can be
 used to complete assignments.
</p>
<p> 
 For me the most interesting piece of technology I have got is the
 Possum (<a href="http://www.possum.co.uk">http://www.possum.co.uk</a>
). This is a computer that can operate almost everything within my bungalow, from the television
 and hi-fi to the phone and windows and doors. This gives me back my
 independence and means that the bungalow is secure. Before owning
 this piece of equipment, my front door had to be left open all day, so
 that carers and friends could get in. The Possum means that I can be in
 bed and still manage to open the front door for visitors.
</p>
<p> 
 Many people have said they don't know how I do it and that I could
 live my life on benefits. I disagree - because my body doesn't work it
 doesn't mean that I should spend my life relying on the state. I want to
 give just like everybody else.
</p>
<p> 
 I hope to train to become a clinical psychologist and to help others with
 disabilities and mental illness. Disability is not a passport to an easy
 life, it is a challenge to fight and win!
