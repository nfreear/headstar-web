<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i68-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Talking Cash Machines Go Live In New Zealand.</h3>
<p> 
 New Zealand's first talking bank cash machines (ATMs) have been
 installed by 13 branches of the country's credit unions, it was
 announced last month.
</p>
<p> 
 And all machines installed in future will have speech capability,
 according to the New Zealand Association of Credit Unions
 ( NZACU - <a href="http://www.nzacu.org.nz/">http://www.nzacu.org.nz/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Customers of the not-for-profit unions, which provide banking and
 insurance services, can access the ATMs through a universal
 headphone socket using any standard set of headphones.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as providing vision-impaired users with greater independence,
 the new machines also enable more privacy when carrying out
 transactions, NZACU spokesperson Vicky Mackenzie told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "What's really good about the machines is that the screen goes blank
 once you plug the headphone in, so a sighted person standing close by
 would not be able to see or hear what transactions are being carried
 out," Mackenzie said.
</p>
<p> 
 The talking ATMs also provide users with detailed information about
 their withdrawals. "The machine tells the user the number of notes that
 have been dispensed. New Zealand currency varies only very slightly
 in size and the notes feel quite similar so it would be difficult to tell
 what denomination they are. But with the machine, if you withdrew
 100 dollars, it would tell you that you've received five notes or 10
 notes or two notes, so you would know what denomination they are
 in," said Mackenzie.
</p>
<p> 
 "The [New Zealand] banks do not have this facility available and the
 Association of Blind Citizens of New Zealand have been pressuring
 them to make a change but they have met with the same response as
 you have in the UK," said Mackenzie. "However, with the Credit
 Unions being the first to release these ATMs, there would be a fair
 amount of social pressure now on other financial institutions to
 upgrade," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 A recent E-Access Bulletin investigation revealed that most major
 High Street banks in the UK have no plans to introduce talking cash
 machines in the near future ( see also Issue 67, July 2005).
</p>
<h3 id="i68-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Orange Admission Over Switching Off Wildfire.</h3>
<p> 
 The mobile phone operator Orange has admitted it underestimated the
 strength of feeling among vision-impaired users which has followed
 the withdrawal of Wildfire, a system which allowed people to access
 services using voice commands.
</p>
<p> 
 Plans to scrap the service, announced earlier this year, led users to
 campaign for the decision to be reversed, gaining widespread media
 coverage. Orange responded by delaying the closure, but the axe
 finally fell on Wildfire in July, after five years
 ( <a href="http://www.orange.co.uk/wildfire/">http://www.orange.co.uk/wildfire/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The service was particularly valued by vision-impaired users because it
 enabled them to search for contact details, make calls, and manage
 messages using voice commands instead of the phone keypad.
</p>
<p> 
 "One thing we've learned from Wildfire is that we didn't appreciate
 how much this service meant to vision-impaired users," Jonathan Rose,
 Orange head of communications told E-Access Bulletin. The closure
 prompted some users to launch campaign web sites such as the
 Campaign to Access Orange
 ( <a href="http://www.croftsfamily.com/campaigntoaccessorange/">http://www.croftsfamily.com/campaigntoaccessorange/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 According to Rose, the decision to scrap Wildfire was taken for a
 combination of technical and business reasons. "We don't have the
 ability to maintain the Wildfire platform," he said. He said Orange
 does now have a team that is actively looking at how to deliver longer
 term benefits to customers with disabilities, although he declined to
 give any specific details.
</p>
<p> 
 The company is offering former Wildfire users free use of TALKS
 ( <a href="http://www.scansoft.com/speechworks/talks/">http://www.scansoft.com/speechworks/talks/</a>
 ), a text-to-speech engine for mobile handsets, and a handset upgrade if
 needed. Customers should dial 294 from their Orange phones to find
 out more. However, TALKS does not interpret voice commands like
 Wildfire, which was installed on a remote server.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03:  'Huge Talent Pool Squandered' If Technology Inaccessible.</h3>
<p> 
 A huge talent pool in every profession is set to be squandered unless
 technology companies can ensure better accessibility to computers and
 information, a leading US assistive technology broadcaster will tell a
 UK accessibility conference next month.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessible digital materials can increase opportunities in all areas of
 life for people with disabilities, but users must ensure mainstream
 technology companies pay more attention to their needs, according to
 John Williams, founder of US-based internet TV station AT508.com
 (<a href="http://at508.com/">http://at508.com/</a>
 ). The station is named after Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act.
</p>
<p> 
 "Most employers still have the idea that people with disabilities can not
 do the work that able-bodied people do," said Williams, who will
 deliver an address at E-Access'05 in London on 14 September
 (<a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess05/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess05/</a>
 ). The conference is hosted by the publishers of E-Access Bulletin and
 supported, among others, by the broadcaster BSkyB; the RNIB;
 content management systems specialist Jadu; web speech-enabler
 Browsealoud and the Society of Public Information Networks (SPIN).
</p>
<p> 
 "The conference can expand the awareness of the availability of
 [assistive technology] products," Williams said. "I am hoping to see
 new products, meet manufacturers and advocates and learn what is
 being done by governments in other countries."
</p>
<h3 id="i68-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Onetel Most Accessible Of Telecoms Web Sites</h3>
<p> 
 Onetel ( <a href="http://www.onetel.co.uk">http://www.onetel.co.uk</a>
 ) has topped the results of a survey on the accessibility of UK telecommunications companies' web sites,
 published this week by the charity AbilityNet
 (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Kingston Communications ( <a href="http://www.kcom.com/">http://www.kcom.com/</a>
 ) also gained a high rating for its site in the survey, which used both automated and
 manual accessibility checks.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet also asked all companies surveyed to make a public
 commitment to web accessibility to which only Kingston
 Communications; Onetel; O2; Telewest; and Vodafone agreed. The
 remaining sites - BT; NTL; Orange; T Mobile; and 3 - failed to meet
 basic accessibility criteria, and failed to sign up to the accessibility
 commitment.
</p>
<p> 
 "[The report] encourages other companies to focus their minds," said
 Jon Gooday, senior consultant at AbilityNet. He said often there is one
 individual within an organisation keen to enhance the accessibility of
 their web site, but without access to resources or support from senior
 managers, the work cannot be carried out. Gooday said this report
 could help such individuals by raising awareness.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet's next web accessibility report will focus on UK utility
 companies.

 patience because of the number of repeated links, read my statements,
 and make a bank transfer payment using speech. I am running
 Window-Eyes version five on Windows XP, and used Internet
 Explorer.
</p>
<p> 
 "I helped my son access his new account with First Direct with exactly
 the same version of Window-Eyes on a different computer and we had
 problems, particularly moving between the on-screen elements and
 having all the text read out. I am assuming there is something different
 in the setup of our screen readers, though what it may be I have as yet

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Technology Focus- MP3 Players.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: The Portable Audio Revolutionby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 It seems like every other person in the street these days is wearing an
 MP3 player to listen to music: they are the 'Walkman' of the present
 day, and even more popular than those original portable music devices.
</p>
<p> 
 It is no surprise therefore that MP3 players have also proven hugely
 popular with blind and vision-impaired people, with their capacity to
 fit a vast amount of music or other audio content into a tiny device that
 fits comfortably in the pocket.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem for vision-impaired users comes with the accessibility of
 the device itself, such as the design of its screen or its buttons.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, when Sue Allard of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa
 Society bought Creative Labs' Nomad ZenXtra MP3 player
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/creative1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/creative1</a>
 ) she had some vision, and could navigate her way around it using a
 magnifier
</p>
<p> 
 "However, now I can no longer see the screen, I have had to give up
 quite a few of its features as it is menu-based," she says. Without a
 text-to-speech option, Allard says she no longer has access to features
 such as 'bookmarking,' an experience she describes as "really
 frustrating.
</p>
<p> 
 "I have worked out how to get to the list of albums, artists and authors
 and can locate individual books or tracks by storing them in
 alphabetical order, but I can no longer use playlists. It's a brilliant but
 not accessible machine," Allard says.
</p>
<p> 
 One advantage of music storage devices for vision-impaired users is
 that they neatly double up as audio book players, and can be used to
 listen to 'podcasts': a term for distribution of audio content over the
 internet such as that used by many internet radio stations.
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, most standard players are not as sophisticated or
 flexible as the generally larger, specialist devices which are designed
 purely to play back audio books. "Most mainstream MP3 players offer
 few navigation options," says Anna Dresner, Publishing Associate
 from the National Braille Press in the US and author of 'The iPod
 Experience: Gaining Access to the iPod shuffle'
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nbp1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nbp1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "If you're trying to read particular pages or look something up in a
 reference book, you need [standard e-book format] DAISY navigation
 features," Dresner says. "DAISY's ability to synchronise text and audio
 is a very exciting idea as well, because it would make it possible to
 search for specific words, check the spelling of unfamiliar words and
 make the book available to deafblind people if a Braille display could
 be used with the DAISY device."
</p>
<p> 
 However, there are MP3 players designed with vision-impaired users
 in mind, and which handle e-books well. The Book Port
 ( <a href="http://sun1.aph.org/products/bp_bro.html">http://sun1.aph.org/products/bp_bro.html</a>
 ) from the American Printing House for the Blind
 ( <a href="http://www.aph.org">http://www.aph.org</a>
 ) for example, plays music files, DAISY files, and text, including Word
 documents and has more advanced navigation features than
 mainstream players.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem with Book Ports, however, is that they use removable
 media. "You are then faced with organising, carrying and sorting
 memory cards," Allard says. "With my Nomad I have my entire music
 collection with me at all times and just about as many Audible books
 as I can download; and all in a device a bit bigger than a cigarette
 packet."
</p>
<p> 
 While levels of accessibility vary from player to player, Apple's iPod
 Shuffle - a device the size, shape and weight of a cigarette lighter with
 the most basic of buttons and space for 120 tracks and up to 120 hours
 of audio book time - rates high for accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 "Except for the battery gauge, the iPod Shuffle is completely
 accessible, and very easy to use," Dresner says. "The major
 disadvantage is that Windows does not treat it like a standard USB
 drive, so you have to use other software to manage it, and iTunes, the
 most common iPod management program, is difficult to use without
 scripts or set files," she says. "This means that you have to spend more
 money to get software that allows you to manage it effectively."
</p>
<p> 
 To answer this problem, last month Brian Hartgen, technical consultant
 at UK-based assistive technology consultancy TandT Limited, released
 accessible scripts for 'iTunes,'
 (<a href="http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html">http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html</a>
 ), allowing vision-impaired users of the JAWS for Windows screen-
 reader to manage their music files. It costs 30 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 Other solutions include Steve Holmes's Window-Eyes set files for
 iTunes
 (<a href="http://www.holmesgrown.com/window-eyes/itunes.zip">http://www.holmesgrown.com/window-eyes/itunes.zip</a>
 ) and the Anapod Explorer
 ( <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/">http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/</a>
 ) from Red Chair Software in the US which costs about 20 pounds. This,
 according to Hartgen, allows you to "treat your iPod a little like
 windows explorer in the sense that you can copy files to and from the
 device using explorer as an interface."
</p>
<p> 
 So the market for both mainstream and specialist MP3 players is
 expanding, and for those devices that are inaccessible, solutions are
 emerging at a rapid pace. The MP3 revolution continues.

<p> 
 There is ever greater acknowledgement in UK education that primary
 accessibility of technology resources is a fundamental right of all
 students and teachers.
</p>
<p> 
 With legislation in place, and burgeoning support networks among
 teachers and parents, inclusive schooling often incorporates advanced
 digital technologies alongside non-technological teaching approaches.
 More teachers than ever before are aware of the existence and
 capabilities of screen readers, Braille displays, text-to-speech, and
 British Sign Language avatars, among other access tools.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the debate around inclusion has seemed to shift over recent
 months from primary accessibility of educational materials to the need
 for a more radical overhaul of the entire structure and fabric of
 classrooms to create the kinds of flexible teaching solutions that so
 many parents and teachers desire.
</p>
<p> 
 Into this debate steps inclusive design, sometimes known as design for
 all, or universal design for learning. It is at heart a moral position that
 states quite bluntly that separate and distinct resources for diverse
 learner groups, while helping them attain against normative assessment
 scales, can leave them without an understanding of other needs and
 other possibilities, and lacking in vital social interaction.
</p>
<p> 
 Inclusive design, in the words of a recent Design Council briefing, is a
 challenge: "The challenge is to use design as a tool for delivering on
 social and political expectations of equality and inclusivity, and so
 create a supportive environment of buildings, products, services and
 interfaces that makes it possible for everyone to live independent and
 fulfilling lives."
</p>
<p> 
 The Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) in the US has
 since 1984 championed digital technologies as the key to modelling
 and promoting the principles of inclusive design. The inherent
 flexibility of digital materials mean that transformations, changes in
 scale, contrast, use of multiple media and input and output options
 have been employed to address student learning needs.
</p>
<p> 
 However, this can be seen as having yoked input and output to
 accessibility too tightly, and specialisation has occurred to create very
 exclusive products. These are valuable tools, allowing researchers and
 consumers to test to the limits the capabilities of the internet, for
 instance.
</p>
<p> 
 One concern voiced by Bob Regan, head of accessibility at
 Macromedia, at a design conference in Brazil last December was that
 the single biggest failure of accessibility expertise is the lack of
 engagement with designers from a wide enough spectrum, from
 products designers through to software developers. It is almost as if
 aesthetic sensibilities, wide use and multiple functionality were
 somehow "detracting" from the core, primary accessibility, and
 worked counter to it in some way.
</p>
<p> 
 Inclusive design decisively challenges this separation. UK educational
 resources need a boost from new and innovative resources that can tear
 down some of the barricades, and a new fund may just hold the answer.
</p>
<p> 
 Inclusive Views
 ( <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/inclusiveviews">http://www.nesta.org.uk/inclusiveviews</a>
 ) is a new fund from the National Endowment for Science, Technology
 and the Arts (NESTA) that aims to advance the use of inclusive design
 within learning tools and applications.
</p>
<p> 
 The fund has launched its first Call for Ideas which seeks to take early
 stage ideas for learning technologies through to market, providing seed
 investment and long term royalties for the selected four ideas. Working
 side by side with Inclusive Technology Limited, NESTA will be keen
 to evaluate hardware and software products that will be sold through
 Inclusive Technology's extensive networks.
</p>
<p> 
 Anyone can apply through the web site listed above: applications
 received so far range from games designers wishing to create fully
 inclusive 3D game worlds, to those wishing to use virtual reality
 avatars to guide users around learning resources on mobile phones.
</p>
<p> 
 All ideas will be judged by an expert panel after the closing date at the
 end of September. Members of the panel are already excited about the
 new solutions that might emerge.
