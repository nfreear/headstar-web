<h3 id="i64-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: A Quarter Of Council Sites Make False Accessibility Claims.</h3>
<p> 
 Almost a quarter of UK council web sites are making false claims
 about how well they measure up to Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG) set out by the World Wide Web Consortium
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
), E-Access Bulletin has discovered.</p>
<p> 
 Research into the accessibility of council sites by the Royal National
 Institute of the Blind, published last month by the local government
 Society of IT Management, found that of the 468 UK council web
 sites, just 62 met level 'A' standards, and none achieved higher levels.
 WCAG specifies three levels of compliance: 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA'.
</p>
<p> 
 However, research by E-Access Bulletin into a sample of 68 sites on
 24 March 2005 found widespread claims of 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA'
 accessibility, by the display of official WCAG logos on the sites,
 contradicting what the RNIB's expert testers had found.
</p>
<p> 
 Nine councils in the sample claimed 'AAA' accessibility for part or all
 of their sites at the time of testing, even though the RNIB found that
 seven of these sites did not even reach single 'A' accessibility, and the
 other two were are only single 'A' sites. A further three claimed 'AA'
 where RNIB found them to not even meet 'A', and six claimed 'A'
 status where only two were entitled to do so - a total of 16 false claims
 in the sample, or 23.5 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 Donna Smillie, who heads the RNIB's web accessibility team, said:
 "The biggest problem is that it devalues the logos - if a site is claiming
 a certain level people won't trust it, because more often than not they
 don't comply." She said one possible reason for the discrepancies
 could be that councils are simply running automated checks for
 accessibility, when additional manual checks are needed to ensure a
 site qualifies.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Full story in Section Four, this issue.
</p>
<h3 id="i64-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Commercial Sites Lack Guidance On Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 E-commerce web sites carry little useful guidance about the level of
 accessibility they provide, according to an independent survey of the
 web sites of 500 top retail and financial services companies providing
 services to the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 Less than 10 per cent of the companies surveyed made any
 commitment to achieving standards set down in the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag1</a>
), either by displaying a logo, or a written statement on their web sites, researchers
 from City University found. Of 250 retailers, just 10 web sites, or 4 per
 cent of the total, claimed to fulfill the requirements of WCAG, the
 internationally recognised benchmark of accessibility. From the
 financial services sector, 27 web sites, or 10.8 per cent did so.
</p>
<p> 
 But after running tests on a random sample of pages using the
 automated Watchfire Bobby tool
 (<a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/index.jsp">http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/index.jsp</a>
), the researchers found that most companies either overstated or made confusing claims
 about the standards achieved by their sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Of the 10 retail sites tested, the Thameslink and Waitrose web sites
 claimed to be 'AA' throughout, but were found to reach just the 'A'
 standard the first level of accessibility, by the City University team.
</p>
<p> 
 Others were more ambiguous, with National Express claiming 'AAA'
 compliance "where possible", while Music Corner has a web page on
 accessibility that is claimed to reach 'AAA', although no specific
 commitments are made for the rest of the site. Neither National
 Express and Music Corner reached even 'A' according to City
 University. Only Marks & Spencer and JD Sports were broadly
 accurate in claiming 'A' compliance, according to the research.
</p>
<p> 
 Financial services companies faired no better. Of 10 sites claiming to
 comply with WCAG and tested with Bobby, just Standard Life and
 Royal Bank of Scotland achieved 'A' requirements, the rest failing to
 reach even this level.
</p>
<h3 id="i64-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Kurzweil Predicts Accessible Future.</h3>
<p> 
 By 2020, technology will eliminate many of the barriers associated
 with sensory and physical disabilities, assistive technology pioneer Ray
 Kurzweil told delegates at Vision 2005, the international conference
 hosted by RNIB (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib6</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Computers as we know them will have changed beyond recognition by
 2010, integrated into everyday objects such as clothing, he said.
 Instead of sitting at a computer, they will be our constant companions,
 feeding us the information we need in the way we choose. For vision-
 impaired people this could mean a whispered commentary, Kurweil
 told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 The cost of hardware and software will decrease by around 50 per cent
 per year, making these technologies widely available, not just
 playthings of the rich, he said. He was keen to emphasise that this need
 not be a threat.
</p>
<p> 
 A pioneer of flat bed scanners, optical character recognition (OCR)
 reading technology and text-to-speech voice synthesisers, Kurzweil
 demonstrated his latest work, software that can translate human voice
 in one language to text, then text and voice output in a different
 language within seconds.
</p>
<p> 
 Showing a flair for showmanship, Kurzweil was not physically present
 at the event, delivering his presentation as a 3-D image at the speakers
 podium.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Us Supermarket Chain Tests Robotic Guide.</h3>
<p> 
 A prototype robotic guide has been developed in the US that allows
 vision impaired people to find their way in airports and locate products
 in supermarkets completely unaided.
</p>
<p> 
 The Robotic Guide uses a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
 reader to locate objects attached to RFID tags; small disks containing
 information on an object, which can be attached to supermarket shelves
 or items. To avoid collisions, the device has a built-in "laser range
 finder" which detects objects up to 8 metres and 180 degrees in front of
 the user.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's intended for airports and grocery stores where a guide dog is not
 going to be much help; a guide dog can't recognise different brands of
 toothpaste," said project team leader professor Vladimir Kulyukin from
 the department of computer science at Utah State University
 (<a href="http://www.cs.usu.edu/">http://www.cs.usu.edu/</a>
). "It is not a replacement guide dog," Kulyukin said.
</p>
<p> 
 The prototype, the size of an upright vacuum cleaner, has been
 deployed in Lee's Marketplace (<a href="http://www.leesmarketplace.com/">http://www.leesmarketplace.com/</a>
), a local Utah supermarket and is being tested by seven vision-impaired
 users.
</p>
<p> 
 To find a particular supermarket item, users type a serial number into a
 Braille keyboard attached to the back of the robot. When a brand is
 located, the device sends an audible signal to the user. However,
 Kulyukin said since many vision-impaired people do not read Braille,
 other formats may be investigated.
</p>
<p> 
 "If we're successful, then in [around] two years some grocery stores
 will have the device," Kulyukin said. Negotiations are currently
 underway on deployment of the device with a US supermarket chain
 and one airport. If deployed at airports, users could call the device and
 ask it to find them on arriving at an airport.
</p>
<p> 
 The robot guide costs 14 to 15,000 dollars but the price could be
 halved if it was produced on a large scale Kulyukin said.
</p>
<p> 
 "This robotic guide can give me more independence, for example, with
 shopping and the ability to find different offices within a business
 building without a sighted person's assistance," said one vision-
 impaired guide-tester.
</p>
<p> 
 "In order to get this robotic guide perfected, we need the help of big
 shopping chains, for example Walmart, or airports to give us the
 opportunity to test it out in different environments, he said."

<p>  The debate on accessible bank statements continues and following Sam Latif's comments in March's Inbox,
 asking for peoples' thoughts on service providers for the blind who

 they provided inaccessible invoicing. They thanked me for making
 them aware and said they will have a solution in six months' time."
 However, Brian Williams has written: "I have been receiving Braille

 unlike some other banks I have used, have thought about this and come
 up with a nice, clear print in adequate size, about 18pt and a good
 contrast font.
</p>
<p> 
 I also use online banking, which I have found to be very good as well,
 with clear layout and information, though I haven't tried this yet with a

 cheap system to obtain spatial data from, for example, leave spatial
 representations to the tactual graphics, and textual data to the audio. I
 received this in response to my enquiry to the company however:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Conference Report- Vision 2005
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Accessibility Is Not Science Fiction.By Derek Parkinson
</h3>
<p> 
 When thinking about how technology can improve our lives it's easy to
 stray into the realms of science fiction, conjuring up a wish-list of
 devices that would be so useful, if only they existed. And were
 affordable, accessible, and properly supported of course.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the striking impressions from the Vision 2005 conference
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib6</a>
) was how much more we should be getting out of the technology that is already available, but that
 achieving this needs much more than just technical research. When
 problems accessibility problems arise, awareness and commitment are
 often the culprits, rather than the technology itself.
</p>
<p> 
 In a session on employment, Ruth Loebl of the RNIB identified IT
 support in the workplace as a potential barrier for vision impaired
 people seeking work. This can be because the services are difficult to
 access, requiring use of a mouse for example, or because staff may not
 know how to install or maintain assistive equipment. The situation is
 further complicated by the trend for large organisations to outsource
 their IT infrastructure and support services, while small organisations
 may be wary of investing in the equipment and expertise needed.
</p>
<p> 
 "We have to be realistic about small companies. We argue that they
 should balance the cost of coping with a disability - when a member of
 staff's vision worsens, for example - against the cost of recruiting and
 training new personnel," said Loebl. "But that argument gets weaker,
 the smaller the company," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Anti-discrimination law could be one of the most effective way to
 change attitudes, delegates heard. "In the US, we've seen the effects of
 [the anti-discrimination law] Section 508. There has been a trickle-
 down effect, so although it only covers the public sector its influence
 has spread more widely," said Loebl. Suppliers to the public sector are
 forced to invest in accessibility, but they then use it as a way of
 competing for private sector business, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK may be about to experience a similar effect, with legislation
 being drawn up that would require the public sector to take a more
 active role in promoting equality of opportunity, particularly among
 disadvantaged groups. This will make accessibility a higher priority for
 procurement decisions, said Loebl.
</p>
<p> 
 Impressive research efforts are going into direction-finding services,
 and many people will have heard about the new PDAs available with
 satellite technology, but Vision 2005 also revealed how much
 interesting work is being done on ground-based wireless technologies.
 For example, a team from the Polish university of Podlasie
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/podlasie">http://fastlink.headstar.com/podlasie</a>
) demonstrated a prototype that uses standard mobile phone technology to give location and direction
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 The system requires infrared transmitters and receivers to be embedded
 in fixed objects at a location, and a standard internet-enabled mobile
 phone. The phone collects information about the identity and direction
 of the nearest object and sends it via the internet to a server which
 computes the best route to a destination. An appealing aspect of this
 approach is that infrared, Bluetooth, and internet connectivity are
 mainstream technologies for mobile phones on sale today.
</p>
<p> 
 Delegates also learned of efforts in Japan to integrate data from a wide
 range of wireless sources, including satellites, radio, infrared, and
 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices, to deliver directions to
 pedestrians. The four year Barrier-Free IT project, funded by the
 Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, aims to build these
 capabilities into a small attachment that is compatible with standard
 mobile phones.
</p>
<p> 
 Making better use of existing technology was also a strong theme in
 sessions dedicated to  accessible web design. Professor Helen Petrie of
 City University (<a href="http://hcid.soi.city.ac.uk/index.html">http://hcid.soi.city.ac.uk/index.html</a>
) ran over the main points of her research into web site accessibility for the UK Disability
 Rights Commission. From a sample of 1,000 web sites in five sectors
 Petrie found that only 19 per cent achieved the most basic requirement
 set down in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag1</a>
), the internationally recognised benchmark of accessibility. Partially sighted people were only able to
 achieve 76 per cent of basic tasks on the sites, while blind people could
 only complete 53 per cent of tasks.
</p>
<p> 
 Delegates also heard about Petrie's plans for future research that will
 shed new light on accessibility problems with web sites, with further
 investigation into the tasks that vision impaired people find difficult,
 and how these compare with problems experienced by sighted users.
</p>
<p> 
 A major problem with web site accessibility is the gulf between the
 clinical reality that determines what users can do, and the technical
 reality of web site design, Jim Tobias of Inclusive Design told
 delegates. "Let's face it, many web sites are designed by 25 year-olds
 who weigh 180 pounds and are as strong as a horse," he said. There are
 an increasing number of tools available that can simulate vision
 problems, enabling designers to build accessibility into a web site from
 an early stage in the building process, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The challenge, he said, is not so much the technology, but in raising
 awareness and encouraging people to use it. "We must take this to the
 designers, they won't come to us," he said.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Claims And Counter-Claimsby Dan Jellinek
</h3>
<p> 
 There are widespread and major discrepancies between levels of
 accessibility claimed for themselves by local government web sites and
 their actual levels of accessibility, research by E-Access Bulletin has
 found.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility of sites to people with disabilities is usually measured
 against the international standards set out by the World Wide Web
 Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
). Their Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) specify three levels of compliance:
 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA'.
</p>
<p> 
 Research into the accessibility of council sites by the Royal National
 Institute of the Blind, published last month by the local government
 Society of IT Management as part of their annual 'Better Connected'
 review of sites, found that of the 468 UK council web sites, just 62 met
 level 'A' standards, and none achieved higher levels.
</p>
<p> 
 However, research by E-Access Bulletin into a sample of 68 sites on
 24 March 2005 found widespread claims of 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA'
 accessibility, by the display of official WCAG logos on the sites, in
 direct contradiction of what the RNIB's expert testers had found.
</p>
<p> 
 The sample of sites was selected to include all 38 sites classified as
 'Transactional' in the Socitm research - the highest overall accolade
 awarded to council sites - plus a further 30 sites selected at random. Of
 the 68 sites examined, just 10 were found by the RNIB to pass 'A'
 level accessibility. None were found to have reached 'AA' or 'AAA'
 standard.
</p>
<p> 
 However, some eight councils in the sample - Barking and Dagenham,
 Chester, Dudley, Hertfordshire, Reigate and Banstead, Stockport,
 Stroud and Tameside - claimed 'AAA' accessibility at the time of
 testing, even though the RNIB found that six of these sites did not even
 reach single 'A' accessibility, and Reigate and Banstead and Tameside
 are only single 'A' sites. In addition Liverpool claimed 'AAA' for
 large parts of its site, and 'AA' for the rest, though the RNIB found it
 did not even meet 'A' level. However, since publishing a report on
 these discrepancies in our sister publication E-Government Bulletin,
 Stroud District Council has removed the misleading logos from its web
 site.
</p>
<p> 
 Three other sites in the sample - Gloucestershire, Tower Hamlets and
 Watford - claimed 'AA' level, although they were not even 'A' level
 according to RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 And six councils - Kensington and Chelsea, Kirklees, Maidstone,
 Swale, Tamworth and Wrexham - all claimed 'A' status when only
 Kensington and Chelsea and Tamworth were entitled to do so,
 according to the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 In all, 16 councils in the sample of 68, or 23.5 per cent, were making
 claims about their accessibility which were not borne out by the
 RNIB's assessment.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB says it stands by its assessments of all the sites, and that no
 council site reached 'AA' or 'AAA' standards of accessibility when it
 tested them in December last year, despite current government
 guidelines specifying that public sector sites should reach 'AA'
 compliance wherever possible.
</p>
<p> 
 Donna Smillie, who heads the RNIB's web accessibility team, said the
 E-Access Bulletin research tallied with her own experience. "I also
 have found big discrepancies between what is claimed and what is
 found. The biggest problem with this is that it devalues the logos - if a
 site is claiming a certain level people won't trust it, because more often
 than not they don't comply."
</p>
<p> 
 She said one possible reason for the discrepancies could be that
 councils are simply running automated checks for accessibility, which
 sometimes seem to specify that a certain level has been reached, when
 in fact further manual checks are always needed to ensure a site
 qualifies.
</p>
<p> 
 The World Wide Web Consortium does not audit the use of its logos,
 and is careful to point out that the system is self-policing. However, it
 recommends owners of sites displaying one of the logos "use a variety
 of review methods to ensure that any page using this logo meets the
 conformance level claimed. Providers should also ensure that anyone
 maintaining or updating the site is familiar with logo use, and either re-
 reviews the page or removes the logo from the page if they are unsure
 whether it still meets a specified conformance level."
</p>
<p> 
 The consortium is also careful to point out that use of the logo should
 not simply be contingent on a site passing automated tests, and that
 manual checking is always essential to determine compliance. "Please
 note that use of this logo is not conditional on an automated test. There
 is as yet no tool that can perform a completely automatic assessment
 on the checkpoints in the guidelines, and fully automatic testing may
 remain difficult or impossible," it says in a statement on its web site.
</p>
<p> 
 Smillie said councils should not necessarily be taken to task for small
 over-claims on accessibility, but that where major discrepancies are
 found, web site users would be within their rights to complain.
</p>
<p> 
 "We found that failures at 'AA' level for example are often quite small
 technical issues, that might impact on a few web users, but not many.
 So maybe, in the context of an aspiration to meet 'AA', a site could be
 entitled to use a logo.
</p>
<p> 
 "But where claims are wildly inaccurate, it is legitimate to query why
 this should be. For example, to ask why a site is claiming 'AAA'
 accessibility, where its 'ALT' tags [to provide text descriptions for
 images] are not useful."
</p>
<p> 
 She said the problems arise from a situation where there is very little
 independent audit of sites for accessibility. Currently in the UK, the
 RNIB's own 'See it Right' service is the only audit in operation, and
 its scope is restricted by the size of its review team.
</p>
<p> 
 But there is an initiative in hand to address the problem at a European
 level, Smillie said. The 'Support-EAM' project (<a href="http://www.support-">http://www.support-</a>

 eam.org) is attempting to define a European Accessibility Mark based
 on existing international guidelines, which could be used as the basis
 for clear independent audit across the continent. Only those
 organisations who had been properly audited would be able to display
 the mark.
