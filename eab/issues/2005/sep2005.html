<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Sponsored Notice: The Xerox Copier Assistant- Digital Copying Made Accessible.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 The new Xerox Copier Assistant - available from your local Xerox
 representative from 1 October - makes it easier for people who are
 visually impaired, blind or have limited dexterity to operate a Xerox
 digital copier without assistance from others.
</p>
<p> 
 The system provides an alternative to commonly-found touch screen
 controls which can be a barrier to many people with disabilities. An
 enlarged on-screen user interface, keyboard navigation buttons
 including tab, arrow and function keys assist usability as does the text-
 to-speech software, which talks the user through the copying steps,
 including advanced features such as collating.
</p>
<!--TODO: section end-->
<p> 
 A range of adaptive technology solutions may be used with the Xerox
 Copier Assistant to further broaden accessibility such as touch-
 sensitive keyboards, high visibility keyboards, foot pedal and
 ergonomic mouse variants.

<h3 id="i69-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Football Clubs To Test Audio Description</h3>
<p> 
 As the new football season gets into its stride, a co-ordinated effort has
 begun to provide vision-impaired fans with wireless audio description
 in more stadiums, including those of lower league clubs.
</p>
<p> 
 Coca Cola league clubs Brighton and Hove Albion, Bristol City,
 Cardiff City, Doncaster Rovers, Huddersfield Town, Swansea City and
 Nationwide Conference side Halifax Town are to test such services, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned. The clubs, working in partnership with the
 RNIB, aim to have the equipment installed and volunteer
 commentators in place by the end of the year.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, the quality of audio description services is patchy, if it is
 provided at all. In many cases, only a small number of headsets are
 available, particularly for away fans, and only at restricted locations in
 the stadium, which often means that families and groups of friends
 have to split up. Wireless technology can deliver the service to all seats
 in the ground.
</p>
<p> 
 Where no audio description services are provided many vision-
 impaired fans are forced to rely on radio commentary, but this can be
 frustrating. "The trouble with radio commentary is the regular
 interruptions while reports come in from other matches, other sports, or
 even traffic updates," said Eleanor Ellison of the RNIB. According to
 Ellison, most Premiership clubs now provide some form of audio
 description service, but the RNIB is keen to see all of them install the
 latest wireless equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 With the surge of interest in cricket following England's victory over
 Australia in the Ashes, the RNIB is hopeful that at least some cricket
 grounds will follow suit. "We've had discussions with the people at
 Lords, the Oval and Sussex Cricket Club," said Ellison. Later this year,
 the institute will partner with the BBC to put together a team of
 volunteer commentators for all the sports venues testing the
 technology.
</p>
<h3 id="i69-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Minister Announces Support For Digital Tv Switchover</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB and broadcasting regulator Ofcom have called for more
 detail from the government about support for blind TV users during the
 national switchover from analogue to digital television.
</p>
<p> 
 Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell outlined
 the decision during a keynote speech she made to the audience of the
 Royal Television Society convention last week.
</p>
<p> 
 "We propose to offer some additional support to those who are
 registered blind so they can benefit from the audio description facilities
 provided by digital technology," Jowell said.
</p>
<p> 
 While the exact nature of the support has not yet been outlined, it will
 be provided to households where one person is blind but it is unclear
 whether the support will come in the form of financial or practical
 assistance.
</p>
<p> 
 "The panel is unhappy about the practical support measures [for]
 socially excluded people including blind and partially sighted people.
 We need more detailed discussions with government," said Georgia
 Klein, Policy Manager of the independent Ofcom Consumer Panel
 ( www.ofcomconsumerpanel.org.uk ).
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, partially sighted TV users were not mentioned in the
 address and the RNIB are asking the government to extend this support
 to partially sighted users, according to RNIB Head of Broadcasting,
 Leen Petrie.
</p>
<p> 
 The switchover, to take place between 2008 and 2012, means analogue
 television will switched off and all programmes will be broadcast
 digitally. A free '0800' number will be provided for customers with a
 disability.

<h3 id="i69-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Accesskeys Needs Standards, Report Finds</h3>
<p> 
 A lack of standards have caused low awareness and take-up of
 accesskeys, the alternative form of web navigation, according to a
 report on accesskeys, published this month.
</p>
<p> 
 Accesskeys are used by people unable to use a mouse or those who
 want to increase efficiency in navigating common links in web sites.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is a present lack of standardisation, for both how to assign
 accesskeys and how they should be represented. Consequently
 awareness of accesskeys is limited," Pete Ward, author of the paper
 told E-Access Bulletin. "The lack of standardisation or guidelines for
 how they should be implemented decreases the benefits which
 accesskeys provide," Ward said.
</p>
<p> 
 Ward also found there are potential clashes between built-in shortcuts,
 for both browsers and user agents, and keys selected to be accesskeys.
 "The number of available keys which may be assigned as an accesskey
 without causing a clash is very low," Ward said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Many web authors, on account of the difficulties associated with
 implementing them, will choose not to utilise them. Standardisation or
 guidelines will encourage web developers to use accesskeys."
 Ward, who also tested a proposed standard with intended accesskeys
 users wrote the paper for his Masters Degree project at University
 College London, with support from consultancy The Usability
 Company.
 ( <a href="http://www.theusabilitycompany.com/">http://www.theusabilitycompany.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i69-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Online Educational Games For Children Launch</h3>
<p> 
 A set of free online educational games for vision-impaired children
 was launched this week.
</p>
<p> 
 The three games: 'Typer,' to help players learn to type on a QWERTY
 keyboard; 'ABC,' to help players learn the English alphabet and
 'Numbers Stuff,' for players to learn basic maths, can be downloaded
 from the VIP Games Zone site
 ( <a href="http://www.vipgameszone.com/">http://www.vipgameszone.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "All programs will have the same interface; this way, children will not
 need to learn a new interface for each program," said developers Alina
 and Igor Khmelevtsov of Israel-based VIP Games Zone. All games
 have an audible menu and 'speak' actions so users do not have to use a
 screen reader. Features such as main menu items and tasks are
 displayed on-screen to allow sighted family and friends to help the
 vision-impaired child operate games initially.
</p>
<p> 
 Each game allows the child to send their score to a scoreboard on
 vipgameszone.com or kids.vipgameszone.com where they can check
 their position against other players.
</p>
<p> 
 The Khmelevtsovs sought views from parents and teachers to feed in to
 the development of the games via a questionnaire on their web site.
 Around 150 replies from parents showed there was a need for online
 educational games on various subjects.
</p>
<p> 
 "We plan to create mailing list for parents to discuss our programs and
 our future projects. We hope this will help us to improve our
 programmes for blind children, making these programs more
 accessible."
</p>
<p> 
 The pair has designed around 100 educational programs for Ukrainian
 schools and have developed a computer training method for children.
 They previously released accessible online game Super Football and
 strategy game Galaxy Ranger, among others.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Technology- Skype.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Access To A World Of Free Voice Callsby Nick Apostolidis.
</h3>
<p> 
 This month, the online auction giant eBay paid 2.6 billion dollars
 worth of cash and stock for a relatively small Swedish company which
 had developed a single piece of software, but a revolutionary one:
 Skype.
</p>
<p> 
 Skype
 ( <a href="http://www.skype.com">http://www.skype.com</a>
 ) is a messaging application that allows you to talk to other Skype users
 worldwide over the internet for free. You can also exchange instant
 messages, swap files including documents, pictures or music, and call
 any ordinary telephone number in any part of the world at very low
 rates.
</p>
<p> 
 The system was developed by two entrepreneurs who had previously
 developed the peer-to-peer file-sharing programme Kazaa, and in two
 years had acquired some 54 million users - a growth-rate of 150,000
 users per day.
</p>
<p> 
 The price paid for the company - which according to some reports
 could rise even further depending on performance - might seem
 somewhat dizzy to the uninitiated. But eBay and many other internet
 portals see online voice communication as a key part of all future
 communication online, and the glue for future online communities.
</p>
<p> 
 Skype uses VoIP (Voice over IP) technology to encode, encrypt and
 transmit the sound of the voice to be decoded at the other end and
 reproduced in near CD-quality sound. It is not only reliable but also
 very secure, as it is not possible for someone to listen in to your
 conversation.
</p>
<p> 
 Skype offers its main functionality - calls between Skype users - for
 free, and the company has said these will always be free. They do
 charge for some enhanced services however, such as 'SkypeOut',
 which allows users to call ordinary telephones anywhere in the world
 over the internet. Sound quality is far superior to a normal telephone.
</p>
<p> 
 'SkypeIn' is another premium service (costing 30 euros a year) that
 allows users to register a phone number with Skype that anyone can
 then call. If you are online when they call, you can receive it, otherwise
 it diverts to Skype Voicemail.
</p>
<p> 
 For blind people, Skype offers many potential benefits beyond the
 obvious ones of free or cheap voice calls. For one thing, it has fairly
 good compatibility with the main types of screen reader including
 JAWS and WindowEyes.
</p>
<p> 
 There are improvements that could be made, and screen reader
 developers have been talking to Skype about how to improve future
 versions for accessibility, including better use of MSAA (Microsoft
 Active Accessibility) - the system used by Windows to communicate
 effectively with screen readers and other assistive technologies. But
 nevertheless it is already mostly accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 There are other accessible features too. You can assign hotkeys for
 answering, holding, resuming or ending a call. You can access the
 menu bar and most of the program functions using keyboard
 procedures.
</p>
<p> 
 However, navigating lists like your missed call list or the list of users
 that are currently online use non-standard Windows controls, with no
 information currently passed through to screen readers using MSAA.
</p>
<p> 
 There are also accessibility problems with the chat part of the program;
 the online Skype directory; and Skype Voicemail, which has point and
 click functionality without many hotkeys.
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand the Skype Store - the part of its web site where
 services are bought - and the Skype web site in general is very well
 designed for screen reader access.
</p>
<p> 
 Page layouts are easy to understand and navigate with a minimum of
 keystrokes. When you use the Skype Store, the web forms are coded
 correctly, with labels for each of the controls, and the HTML is written
 in such a way that the screen reader can interpret it correctly. In the
 community section of the web site, there also is a message board which
 is also very accessible, unlike many others to be found on major sites.
</p>
<p> 
 As Skype continues to develop - and with eBay's billions behind it,
 one would assume it will do so rapidly - new services will be added
 such as call forwarding. We must hope that the Skype interface
 continues to improve so better access is provided using standard
 Windows controls, a better structured hierarchy and a more usable
 design.
</p>
<p> 
 As the popularity of Skype continues to skyrocket, it is also to be
 expected that a clutch of rivals such as Google's Google Talk
 (<a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">http://www.google.com/talk/</a>
) will attempt to steal its thunder. Screen reader developers and users will need to keep an eye on all these
 systems as well: Google Talk for example is not yet usable at all from
 the keyboard.
</p>
<p> 
 Skype must now set the accessibility standard at a high level: and then
 hopefully the others will follow.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four - Technology Focus- MP3 Players Part II
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: Getting Them Talkingby Mel Poluck
</h3>
<p> 
 Having an mp3 player can open the gates to a wealth of audio content,
 from music to audio books. But not all players are designed with
 vision-impaired people in mind, and many small or specialist
 developers have taken up the challenge to make mp3 players accessible
 to vision-impaired users.
</p>
<p> 
 Work is now underway, for example, on text-to-speech firmware, or
 instantly upgradeable hardware, for players from global digital
 entertainment company Archos
 ( <a href="http://www.archos.com/">http://www.archos.com/</a>
 ), which will allow vision-impaired users to independently navigate
 menus and features.
</p>
<p> 
 The firmware, called Rockbox
 ( <a href="http://www.rockbox.org">http://www.rockbox.org</a>
 ), developed as an open source project in Sweden and Germany, comes
 from US-based software company Red Chair
 (<a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/">http://www.redchairsoftware.com/</a>
 ) and will soon be compatible with the Archos iRiver H and IHP series,
 which cost 200 to 250 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's still in development, and that's why it's not as stable or
 feature-rich
 as it might be. I'd describe it as a late-stage beta, with some bugs still
 to be ironed out and some features still to be added," Aman Singer, a
 keen blind mp3 user from Canada told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Many models of the Archos line compatible with Rockbox, are
 relatively old so users often resort to finding them on auction sites.
 Rockbox has a dedicated page for blind users on its web site:
 <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlindUsersIndex">http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlindUsersIndex</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 "The iRiver series of players [from Archos] have lots of advantages,"
 said Brian Hartgen, Technical Consultant at TandT Consultancy. "The
 greatest advantage is the volume of data these players can
 accommodate, their ease of use from a file transfer perspective, and the
 fact that you can use them as a portable hard disk to transfer other file
 types to and from your home computer, which I have found to be very
 useful."
</p>
<p> 
 The volume of data a player can store can be a key deciding factor
 when choosing a player. And while Apple Macintosh's iPod Shuffle is
 one of the most accessible players on the market, its disadvantage is its
 lack of storage capacity compared to other models.
</p>
<p> 
 "Despite one gigabyte being the maximum storage capacity however,
 this will hold about 9 or 10 books in high quality audio," Hartgen said
 about the player.
</p>
<p> 
 As a point of comparison, some Archos players can be upgraded to
 hold six times the amount of data held on the iPod. The iRiver series,
 offers 20 to 40 times the storage space of players such as the MuVo,
 from US-based company Creative Technology
 (<a href="http://www.creative.com/products/welcome.asp?category=213&subca">http://www.creative.com/products/welcome.asp?category=213&subca</a>

 tegory=215& ).
</p>
<p> 
 But Archos range devices will not play books from popular
 publications download site Audible,
 ( www.audible.com ),
 which the iPod does and in Europe at least, the player does not support
 the online mp3 music download service Napster To Go
 (<a href="http://www.napster.com/ntg.html">http://www.napster.com/ntg.html</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "[US software company] Red Chair
 ( <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/">http://www.redchairsoftware.com/</a>
 ) has done a deal with Audible so that you can just [transfer] Audible
 files to the Shuffle," Saqib Shaikh, Business analyst at Vodafone UK
 said. "And it's completely accessible. You don't need to install iTunes
 and I recommend not installing it since it stops windows from
 representing it as a drive," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 There is a wide choice of software to make the iPod range more
 accessible. For screen reader users, there is Hartgen's accessible scripts
 for iPod software iTunes, launched last month; Window-Eyes' set files,
 which can be used without a screen reader; and the Anapod Explorer
 from Red Chair.
</p>
<p> 
 But these solutions are not without their drawbacks. "While you can
 transfer books using Anapod without problem to the iPod shuffle,"
 Hartgen said, "experience has demonstrated from various sources that
 the position within an Audible book is not retained when it is on the
 shuffle, whereas it is if the books are transferred using iTunes"
</p>
<p> 
 And there is yet more work going on to make the iPod accessible.
 "There is another program called All-Tunes
 ( <a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/cgi-bin/sliki/AllTunes">http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/cgi-bin/sliki/AllTunes</a>
 ) developed by a group of students from the University of North
 Carolina in the US. This seems like a project to see if iTunes could be
 made accessible to screen reader users, and I have not personally had a
 lot of success using it," said Hartgen, who has recently set up an email
 discussion list on mp3 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Much progress has been made to make mp3 devices accessible to
 vision-impaired users. Currently though, weighing up the accessibility
 pros and cons of a device is still the job of the user.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Brian Hartgen will be presenting a paper on accessible portable
 media players at RNIB conference Techshare
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_">http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_</a>
