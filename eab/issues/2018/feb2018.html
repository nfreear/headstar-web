## Section One: News.

### 01: Government asks the experts for guidance in assistive technology inquiry.

Accessibility professionals and assistive technology users have given the
UK Government recommendations in an inquiry organised by the government’s
Work and Pensions Select Committee.

The inquiry looked at how technology can help improve employment rates
among those with disabilities, as part of the government’s response to a
report on the disability employment gap.

During the inquiry, held at the House of Commons, assistive technology
users were asked how technology supports them in the workplace, and two
other ‘witnesses’ – Robin Christopherson, Head of Digital Inclusion at
technology charity AbilityNet, and Hector Minto, Senior Accessibility
Evangelist at Microsoft – were called on to answer questions from a panel
of MPs.

Christopherson talked about the usefulness of mainstream technology in
providing assistive functions, explaining that mobile phone apps now
allow him to do what used to require thousands of pounds’ of specialist
assistive technology.

He told the Committee, “We have really moved away from the idea of
‘specialist’ being what disabled people need, to having to get the right
advice, the right recommendations, to help people customise what they
have on their desk in front of them or in their pocket”.

Responding to a question from Alex Burghart MP, on how government and
employers can keep up-to-date with evolving assistive technologies, Minto
said: “I don’t think you can claim to be disability confident, both in
terms of accessing customers with disabilities or employing people with
disabilities, if you don’t have basic technological experience.”

Minto also urged the need not to overlook users of older assistive
technologies. He said: “There is a huge base of people using legacy
software and legacy AT. So, we must make sure we’re not saying, ‘Everyone
move across to the built-in mainstream solutions’. People are still using
JAWS, NVDA and Dragon Dictate, and our systems must still support those
people rather than forcing them to use modern technology.”

In the first part of the inquiry, a cross-sector group of assistive
technology users and trainers spoke about their experiences. Asked how
she uses assistive technology in the workplace, senior civil servant
Jo-Ann Moran said: “It is my equivalent of free access into a building …
Effectively, assistive technology is my enabler to maintain full-time
employment.”

However, Moran also said that assistive technology systems used in some
parts of government are not reliable enough, explaining that this
unreliability has held her back in her job: “My problem now is I will not
go for promotion because of my IT. I am a top performer in my grade and I
keep getting told, ‘Come on, go for it,’ but I cannot, because I am just
not going to be reliable. If I go for a job working for a minister, a
minister is not going to accommodate me when I say, ‘Sorry, my computer
is not working today.’ That is where my barrier is at the moment.”

E-Access Bulletin asked Christopherson the inquiry signalled a step
forward for awareness of assistive technology. He said: “It is
encouraging to see accessibility, assistive technology and the importance
of digital inclusion being highlighted in this inquiry. For far too long
(nearly two decades now) we have had legislation without action or
impact. The result, we hope, will be more enforcement, more proactivity
in applying adjustments to assist applicants and employees to perform at
their best, and more business benefits for companies everywhere as they
embrace inclusion and diversity in their products and processes.”

In a written response provided as part of the inquiry, AbilityNet CEO
Nigel Lewis also explained the assistive benefits of mainstream
technology, stressing the need for personalised recommendations in the
workplace. Lewis wrote: “Giving disabled people access to the correct
assistive technology means they will succeed in their role, which in turn
raises awareness, challenges prejudices, promotes inclusion and
encourages diversity in the workplace.”

### 02: “Born accessible” e-books is the grand plan for new e-publishing tool.

A free tool to test e-book content for accessibility errors has been
launched.

The ‘Ace’ tool has been developed by the DAISY Consortium, a global
organisation working to improve and promote accessible publishing and
reading. The aim is to improve e-book usability for a wider audience and
eliminate the barriers to reading e-books encountered by people with
disabilities.

Ace works by assessing the content of e-books published in the widely
used EPUB format. Automated checks are performed and accessibility issues
are flagged-up in a report generated by the tool.

The hope is that the tool will assist the publishing industry and authors
in creating e-books that conform to the EPUB Accessibility specification.
Speaking to e-Access Bulletin, DAISY Consortium’s Chief Operating Officer
Avneesh Singh said: “We expect the publishing industry to use Ace widely,
integrate it in their production workflows and improve accessibility of
all their publications over time, leading to ‘born accessible’
publications.”

However, Ace’s developers are keen to stress the tool’s limitations as
well as its benefits. They point out that Ace performs only automated
checks and does not provide a complete picture of all possible
accessibility violations, and should therefore be used alongside other
forms of testing and evaluation.

Singh said: “Automated tools like Ace can help in identifying the
accessibility issues and greatly help in reducing human labour involved
in manual accessibility testing, but it cannot completely replace the
human intervention and judgement. We have provided this statement to make
it clear that one cannot claim conformance to standards like WCAG by just
using Ace. Ace will definitely provide great help in accessibility
inspection, but it will not replace human driven checks and human
judgement.”

An additional manual inspection tool is also being developed by DAISY
Consortium, Singh said. This tool uses the accessibility reports
generated by Ace and guides the user through the manual inspection
process.

Grant money from the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities project helped
to fund the development of the Ace tool. DAISY was selected as one of the
winners of the project, which awarded $20 million to 29 non-profits
developing accessible technology.

### 03: Apps combine forces to give visually impaired passengers a smoother ride.

Popular global transportation app Moovit has partnered with Be My Eyes,
an app service providing sighted assistance to visually impaired people,
aiming to make transit easier for users with sight loss

Moovit, which is used by over 120 million people in 80 countries and
claims to be ‘the world’s number one transit app’, helps people move
around cities by providing users with transport information, such as bus
and train trackers and real-time updates. Be My Eyes connects visually
impaired users with sighted volunteers to answer queries through a video
call– for example, checking the sell-by date on food packaging. The
service is used by over 60,000 people with sight loss and has over
876,000 sighted volunteers.

The partnership means that anyone using Moovit can now navigate to Be My
Eyes through a new menu command, so that users can combine the two
services. For example, someone with sight loss who is using Moovit to
find out bus arrival times can then switch to Be My Eyes to help them get
on the correct bus and find a seat once on-board.

After working with a blind developer, Adi Kushnir, to make the service
more accessible for visually impaired users, all Moovit screens were made
compatible with Apple’s VoiceOver and Android’s TalkBack features in
2016.

In a separate collaboration, Be My Eyes has also teamed up with
Microsoft, to offer users access to the Microsoft Disability Answer Desk
for technology-related queries. The latest update of the app features an
additional ‘Specialized Help’ menu that takes users directly to the
Disability Answer Desk, where they can ask a dedicated team for
assistance with Microsoft services and products.

).
## News in Brief:

04: Tech Support: Google has launched a disability support team to answer
accessibility queries from users. The team will answer questions about
using separate assistive technology with Google products, as well as
Google’s own accessibility features, such as ChromeVox or TalkBack. The
support team will answer questions by email and are available
Monday-Friday, working on Pacific Standard Time. To contact the team,
email:
[disability-support-external@google.com](<a href="mailto:mailto:disability-support-external@google.com">mailto:disability-support-external@google.com</a>).
[Read more about the support team at the Google Accessibility
Blog](https://www.google.com/accessibility/blog/).

05: Virtual World: A cane that lets people with sight loss experience
virtual reality has been developed by Microsoft. Named the Canetroller,
the system features a ‘haptic cane controller’, which generates sounds,
physical resistance and vibrations when it encounters objects in a
virtual landscape, simulating how a cane behaves in the real world. One
aim of the project is to help people with sight loss practice navigation
skills in a controlled environment.

[Read more about the Canetroller at the Microsoft Research
portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/enabling-people-visual-impairments-navigate-virtual-reality-haptic-auditory-cane-simulation-2/).

06: Coding By Voice: A developer has coded a video game without using his
hands, instead using only his voice, through a customised version of
speech-recognition software. In an interview with technology news website
Ars Technica, Rusty Moyher explained how he was unable to use his hands
to code after severe repetitive strain injury (RSI), but discovered a
system from developer Travis Rudd, who converted Dragon NaturallySpeaking
to write code using just his voice. Moyher’s resulting game was ‘Dig
Dog’, where players control a dog hunting for treasure.

## Section Two: Research.

### 07: Inclusive fitness equipment – an exercise in missed opportunity.

Going to the gym or using exercise equipment at home is simply part of a
daily routine for many, but locking-in this routine isn’t as easy for
some people. A huge amount of modern fitness equipment just isn’t
accessible for those with a visual impairment, as a new report has
demonstrated.

The study, ‘Inclusive fitness equipment for people with a visual
impairment’, was commissioned by sight loss charity Thomas Pocklington
Trust and carried out by Rica (the Research Institute for Consumer
Affairs). It showed the prevalence of console systems that are partially
or entirely unusable to people with a visual impairment, despite a
widespread desire among this group stay physically active.

e-Access Bulletin found out more about the study from Lynn Watson, Head
of Research at Thomas Pocklington Trust, and Chris Lofthouse, Outreach
Manager at Rica.

– E-Access Bulletin: Does the topic of fitness for people with a visual
impairment get overlooked?

Lynn Watson: “Research from RNIB showed that 64% of visually impaired
people would like to be more physically active and that many feel held
back by various barriers. These include persistent social attitudes and
the slowness of many designers and manufacturers to embrace inclusive
design.”

Chris Lofthouse: “Our research with gym managers and equipment
manufacturers showed a low level of awareness of the needs of visually
impaired people. Until they become aware, inclusive gym equipment is
likely to be a low priority for them. We hope that our research will help
to raise awareness of visually impaired people’s enthusiasm for getting
and staying healthy, as well as the barriers that stop them taking part.”

– What did the study find to be the biggest issues faced by visually
impaired users?

Chris: “Participants found that consoles with tactile buttons, audio
output, colour contrast and block colours were more accessible. Our
testers unanimously agreed that there was a need for voice-over on all
console types.

“In terms of environment, use of cardiovascular fitness equipment had a
substantial impact upon users’ lives, including improvements in everyday
fitness and mental health. However, our testers found accessing fitness
equipment and facilities challenging because of drawbacks in the built
environment and customer service.”

– How important is audio output on fitness machines to make them
inclusive for a visually impaired audience?

Lynn: “Very important. Voice-over technology was seen by participants as
an urgent requirement. From interviews with industry representatives, the
barriers to progress were: cost, industry culture, lack of awareness and
over-reliance on formal standards, which have not kept pace with advances
in technology.”

Chis: “There are limited options available, because there is no
discernible trend within the fitness sector toward audio output. Some
said that the way ahead would be to integrate gym equipment controls with
smartphone technology.”

– Were there any pieces of equipment that stood out as being particularly
inclusive for visually impaired users?

Lynn: “This doesn’t come through in the research. The study indicates
that LED consoles are moderately more accessible than touchscreen
consoles, but neither type performed very well.”

Chris “None stood out. A rowing machine manufacturer, Concept2, has
introduced ErgChatter, a free software tool which provides audio output,
but there is little else on offer.”

– What were participants’ key recommendations from the study?

Chris: “Wider use of audio output and voice-over technology; use of
wireless technology; ability to increase font size on screens; tactile
buttons and high-contrast colours on LED consoles; improved layout,
colour use, signage and lighting in leisure centres; trained staff to
assist VI people in using equipment.

“People in focus groups argued that VI-friendly adaptations would also
improve going to the gym for other users, such as people with learning
disabilities and people with different motor or sensory skills.”

– What can gyms and leisure centres do to become more inclusive for
customers with a visual impairment?

Chris: “1\. Develop a best-practice guide for manufacturers, outlining
design features most appropriate for visually impaired users.

2\. Support an update to the Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI) standards
set by the English Federation of Disability Sport, reinforcing the case
for inclusive design.

3\. Product design teams to make better use of guidelines and best
practice from other industries, independent organisations and
governmental bodies.

4\. Improve staff training and communication procedures across the
fitness sector, using the NHS Accessible Information Standard.

&lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5\. Implement a voluntary ‘buddy scheme’ at all
public sector leisure centres to assist visually impaired users and other
disabled users.”
