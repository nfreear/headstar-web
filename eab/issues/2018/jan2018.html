<h3 id="i196-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Innovative Tech Solutions Sought To Help Ageing Consumers.</h3>
<p> 
 A newly launched initiative is seeking innovative technological products
 and services to address some of the challenges presented by ageing.
</p>
<p> 
 The Innovation for Ageing project will bring together different groups to
 support older people as they become more vulnerable with age, through
 conditions such as sight loss, hearing loss and dementia.
</p>
<p> 
 The year-long programme is being led by the International Longevity
 Centre (ILC-UK) and is supported by financial services group Just. The
 aim is to uncover “technological and policy innovations and solutions,”
 as well as reworking existing products and services, according to a press
 release.
</p>
<p> 
 Innovation for Ageing was officially launched earlier this month in
 London. Speaking at the event, David Sinclair, Director of ILC-UK,
 revealed more about how the project will work. One focus will be on
 identifying different sets of problems associated with ageing, to ensure
 that a range of detailed solutions are found by teams of experts.
</p>
<p> 
 He emphasised the need for a range of ideas through the project, rather
 than relying solely on advanced technology: “There are smart meters with
 the potential to identify when someone falls over, there are initiatives
 that use Uber to deliver flu vaccinations – but I want to emphasis that
 Innovation for Ageing isn’t just about hi-tech. Some of the solutions
 might tackle questions like: how do we get a bath rail into someone’s
 home before they have a fall? And how do we ensure someone has access to
 information and advice, so that they can choose the right sort of care
 options?”
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to e-Access Bulletin about how technology could be utilised in
 the initiative, Sinclair again stressed the need for diverse thinking. He
 said: “New technology offers significant potential for helping vulnerable
 older people manage in an increasingly complex world. Through Innovation
 for Ageing we will seek out innovative technologies and services that
 might help tackle the challenges faced by vulnerable older consumers. But
 the solutions are unlikely to lie just in designing new bits of kit. We
 must ensure that existing technologies that older people rely on are as
 usable and accessible as possible.”

<h3 id="i196-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Websites, Not Assistive Tech, Are Key To Accessibility, Say Screen-Reader Users.</h3>
<p> 
 New research into screen-reader usage has revealed the majority of users
 feel that improving existing websites would have a bigger impact on
 accessibility compared to better assistive technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The newly published findings are taken from the seventh Screen Reader
 User Survey by non-profit organisation WebAIM, conducted in October 2017.
 A total of 1,792 people responded to the survey, 89.2% of which reported
 using a screen-reader due to a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Asked whether they felt ‘better (more accessible) websites’ or ‘better
 assistive technology’ would have the greatest impact on improvements to
 web accessibility, 85.3% of respondents opted for ‘better websites’, with
 only 14.7% choosing ‘better assistive technology’.
</p>
<p> 
 Jared Smith, WebAIM’s Associate Director, told e-Access Bulletin that the
 finding “puts the responsibility squarely on website authors to implement
 accessibility”. He said: “Over several years, the responses to this
 question have increasingly shifted from assistive technology improvements
 to website improvements, perhaps indicating that screen-readers have
 gotten better in recent years. It is of interest that while respondents
 increasingly need accessibility improvements to websites, they are
 generally optimistic about accessibility progress on the web.”
</p>
<p> 
 The results of the survey also shed light on a range of issues
 experienced by screen-reader users, as well as revealing preferred
 technology and browsing habits. CAPTCHAs were found to be the most
 significant problem for users, remaining the top problem reported by
 respondents since the last WebAIM survey in 2015.
</p>
<p> 
 Other issues noted in the report include ‘unexpected screen changes’,
 ambiguous links or buttons, Flash content, lack of keyboard
 accessibility, complex forms, and missing alt text.
</p>
<p> 
 Asked how they felt about the accessibility of web content overall during
 the past year, 40.8% of respondents said that content had become more
 accessible, 40.4% felt it hadn’t changed, and 18.8% said it had become
 less accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Another key finding was the continued popularity of mobile apps as a
 means of accessing the web and, similarly, increased usage of mobile
 screen-readers: 88% of respondents used a mobile screen-reader – the
 highest figure yet recorded in a WebAIM survey.

<h3 id="i196-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Facebook Uses Ai To Open Up Photos For Blind Users.</h3>
<p> 
 Blind and visually impaired users of Facebook will be able to find out
 which of their friends are in photos thanks to facial recognition
 technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Facial recognition is already used by the social networking site – for
 example, to suggest friends that users may want to tag in photos – but
 the company recently extended the use of this feature for screen-reader
 users. The new feature means that those users will be able to hear which
 of their friends are in photographs that appear on the user’s news feed,
 even if those friends are not tagged in the picture.
</p>
<p> 
 A post on the Facebook Newsroom site describes how the facial recognition
 feature works by using AI (artificial intelligence) technology. “Our
 technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and
 generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos
 are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template.”
</p>
<p> 
 In 2016 Facebook launched an ‘automatic alt text’ tool that attempted to
 identify objects and people in photographs. The tool used object
 recognition technology to describe these elements for screen-reader
 users, though the scope of what it could identify was limited.
 Expressions, such as smiling, were described, but the tool was limited to
 mentioning the number of people in a picture, rather than their
 identities
</p>
<p> 
 The new feature means that screen-reader users will now be able to hear
 who is in a photo, with plans to continue developing the technology and
 what it can recognise.
</p>
<p> 
 However, as a privacy measure, all Facebook users will soon be able to
 switch this facial recognition feature on or off.

<h3 id="i196-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Cultural Call-out:</h3>
<p>  458 museums around the UK are being asked to add access information to their websites by accessible arts charity
 VocalEyes. An audit by VocalEyes in 2016, named State of Museum Access,
 found that these museums lacked visitor accessibility information on
 their websites, such as wheelchair access information and contact details
 for access queries. Ahead of the 2018 State of Museum Access report, the
 charity has contacted the 458 museums to request that they provide this
 information.

<p>  Minneapolis-St. Paul International has become the second airport in the United States to offer blind and visually impaired
 travellers free access to Aira, an app system to help them navigate the
 building. Users wear smart glasses, the visual field of which is streamed
 to a sighted guide, who then gives the visually impaired user directions,
 enabling them to find their way around the airport. Aira usually costs
 $89 a month but is available at Minneapolis-St. Paul International and
 Memphis International Airport for free.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Interview.– Jackie Brown, Chair of the British Computer Association of the Blind.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Finding Your Game-Changer.</h3>
<p> 
 When Jackie Brown was introduced to the speech synthesiser on the Acorn
 BBC Micro computer in 1984, it was to be the beginning of a valuable and
 productive interest in assistive technology. Jackie, who is blind,
 continued to use and explore different technologies as they evolved,
 finding them beneficial to her career as a writer.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2007 Jackie subscribed to the email list of the British Computer
 Association of the Blind (BCAB). She went on to edit the BCAB newsletter
 and stood for the Board of Trustees in 2015 before becoming Secretary. In
 November 2017, Jackie was appointed as BCAB Chair. e-Access Bulletin
 spoke to Jackie about her work within BCAB and aims for the organisation,
 and about the kinds of assistive technology she uses on a daily basis.
</p>
<p> 
 - E-Access Bulletin: Tell us about the work of the British Computer
 Association of the Blind.
</p>
<p> 
 - Jackie Brown: “BCAB was founded in 1969, primarily as a group of blind
 computer programmers. But with the changes in, and pace of, technology,
 the Association now helps people use a wide range of equipment, from
 computers with screen-readers through to smartphones, tablets, digital
 assistants and everything in between.
</p>
<p> 
 “We have an email list, a quarterly newsletter, monthly online
 presentations, our annual TechABreak weekend, a podcast, and even an
 Amazon Echo Alexa ‘skill’ that allows users to access BCAB content. My
 motto is that if we can help at least one person to get to where they
 want to be with their technology, then of course BCAB is worthwhile. It
 isn’t an elitist charity, it’s for everyone.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How did it feel to be appointed as Chair of BCAB?
</p>
<p> 
 “I was absolutely thrilled and honoured to be elected. I care very deeply
 for the BCAB community and want to devote as much of my own time as
 possible to taking the Association forward to make it more appealing and
 accessible to a wider audience.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What do you hope to bring to the role?
</p>
<p> 
 “As a woman who is passionate about technology and its many uses, of
 course I would like to see more women standing for the Board of Trustees
 in the future and generally getting involved. There are a lot of people
 out there who regard this field as a man’s world – not so!
</p>
<p> 
 “But I also want to be able to offer our members more for their money and
 reach a wider audience, not just around the UK, but internationally as
 well. We have lots of exciting plans and I feel incredibly privileged to
 lead and be a part of that.”
</p>
<p> 
 - You are currently the only female Board Trustee at BCAB. Do you feel
 that the technology and assistive technology sectors are male-dominated?
</p>
<p> 
 “Yes, very much so. Sometimes it comes across to me as though only men
 should know what makes various components of a computer tick or have an
 association with the tech industry and its gadgetry. This is very sad,
 since there are plenty of tech-savvy women out there who have a rightful
 place in the field.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How could more women be encouraged to work within the assistive
 technology sector, rather than just using the technology?
</p>
<p> 
 “I think men need to stop thinking that technology is only for them and
 start treating women equally. Perhaps it is a cultural thing that has
 evolved around the world, but this is the 21st century and women need to
 start being counted in this sphere.
</p>
<p> 
 “It takes time to get noticed, but my advice is not to be intimidated by
 a man who thinks he knows better just because the subject matter is
 technology. I used to work on a technical support desk for a
 screen-reader company, and one man actually asked to speak to my male
 colleagues when he had a problem, because he didn’t think a woman would
 know what to do!”
</p>
<p> 
 - When did you first start using assistive technology and what kinds of
 systems or devices were you using then?
</p>
<p> 
 “I started my working life on an old manual typewriter. From there, I
 began using an electric typewriter and then, in 1984, was introduced to
 the Acorn BBC Micro and primitive speech synthesiser. For me, this was a
 real game-changer. It meant I could read back my own work, and while it
 was fairly basic, it provided an independence that was unparalleled at
 that time. From there I went on to DOS, then all platforms of Windows. As
 the years went by, the technology and what a blind person could do with
 it just kept getting better.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What types of assistive technology do you use on a day-to-day basis?
</p>
<p> 
 “I use Windows 10 with the JAWS screen-reader software and Braille
 display attached to my computer. This enables me to send and receive
 email, compose and proofread Word documents, work with spreadsheets,
 browse the internet and shop online, access my music collection,
 participate in online meetings and lots of other things.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have a smartphone with text-to-speech that lets me send and receive
 text messages, access email, use apps and keep in touch with people in
 the same way sighted people do with their bits of kit. I love using
 digital assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home, and wireless speaker
 systems in the form of Sonos. I also convert print to Braille for
 embossing, and scan print to text using Optical Character Recognition
 (OCR). My whole life is geared around technology.”
</p>
<p> 
 - You run The Browns’ Place, a website with reviews of assistive
 technology products. How do you decide which products to review?
 And how do you approach reviewing the assistive features of a product?
</p>
<p> 
 “Generally speaking, if I purchase a piece of kit or a company loans me
 something, then I try to review it. I get some practical hands-on
 experience of the gadget first: learning where its buttons are situated
 and what it does. Once I’ve done that I write my review, describing it to
 readers in the way I would want something described to me.
</p>
<p> 
 “I try to be as honest and balanced as possible. If something isn’t
 particularly accessible for a blind person, I will say so. There is no
 point misleading your reader just to please whoever loaned you the gadget
 in the first place. I like to think I have a good reputation with readers
 and companies, but it takes time to build up a rapport and trust.”
