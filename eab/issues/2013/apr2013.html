<h3 id="i157-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessible Copyright Treaty Hits New Roadblock.</h3>
<p>  
 The World Blind Union (WBU) has reacted angrily to a new
 setback to long-running work on an international copyright
 treaty which could improve access to accessible books for
 blind and visually impaired people.
</p>
<p>  
 The union has been a key negotiator in talks at the World
 Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) which have been
 going on for almost five years. Following the latest round of
 talks from 18-20 April in Geneva, the WBU released a
 statement saying the discussions “devoted almost no time to
 insuring that the treaty will encourage the cross border sharing
 of desperately needed books for the blind”, concentrating
 instead on protecting the rights of existing copyright holders.
</p>
<p>  
 One of the main areas the WBU has been trying to negotiate is
 for exceptions in copyright laws which govern the sharing
 between countries, which would allow easier access to
 accessible versions of books and other materials.
</p>
<p>  
 When a “roadmap” for formalising a treaty was approved in
 October last year, WBU Vice Chair Dan Pescod had told E-
 Access Bulletin it signalled the “finish line” in sight. However,
 Pescod also warned against the creation of a “trophy treaty”
 which would have little or no use in allowing books to be
 shared more easily (see E-Access Bulletin 152:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=776">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=776</a>
 )</p>
<p>  
 This threat now seems to be growing. In a statement about the
 meeting, Fred Schroeder, First Vice President of the World
 Blind Union, said: “WBU is alarmed that some of the
 negotiators have focused their efforts almost exclusively on
 crafting language around copyright protections that have
 nothing to do with the ability of authorised entities to produce
 books for the blind and visually impaired.”
    
 A two-week diplomatic conference will now take in place in
 Morocco in June to finalise the wording of the treaty and
 discuss how it will be implemented. The latest draft can be
 viewed in PDF from the links below.

<h3 id="i157-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Great Expectations Of E-Book Access Demonstrations.</h3>
<p>  
 Accessibility is “rising up the agenda” of the publishing
 industry as awareness grows of the value of helping people
 access electronic books in multiple formats, a publishing
 standards body said this month.
</p>
<p>  
 The statement came following a live demonstration of
 accessible readings from “Great Expectations” by Charles
 Dickens at the London Book Fair in an event organised by the
 Royal National Institute of Blind People, the Publishers
 Licensing Society and EDitEUR – the trade standards body for
 the global book industry.
</p>
<p>  
 Technologies demonstrated live included font size adjustment
 on the Kindle e-reader; a text-to-speech reader; and use of an
 iPod to produce both text-to-speech and a Braille output linked
 to a Bluetooth Braille display.
</p>
<p>  
 Helen Gunesekera, Media Development Officer (Publishing
 and Reading) at RNIB, told E-Access Bulletin said the live
 Braille display demonstration in particular struck a chord with
 the audience. “Being able to see the Braille display in action
 really caught the imagination of people in the audience, few of
 whom were aware that this was technically possible,”
 Gunesekera said.
</p>
<p>  
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin after the event Mark Bide,
 Executive Director of EDItEUR, said accessibility is “rising up
 the agenda” in the publishing industry. He said there are now
 good levels of compliance with a 2010 recommendation by the
 Publishers Association that text-to-speech be routinely enabled
 on all e-books across all platforms, except where there is an
 audiobook edition commercially available.
</p>
<p>  
 “It’s not at the top of the agenda but things have improved
 enormously over the last four or five years. There is a
 recognition that there are a number of very good reasons for
 making e-books accessible, one of which is market-driven: by
 bringing what has previously been a very specialist activity to
 the mainstream, you actually increase the overall market.”
</p>
<p>  
 Bide said progress was founded on the Joint Statement on
 Accessibility ( <a href="http://bit.ly/12IZBUl">http://bit.ly/12IZBUl</a>
 ), a pledge issued by the Publishers Association in April 2012, asking for sector-wide
 support across the publishing industry to improve e-book
 accessibility (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 147:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=714">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=714</a>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Location Networking Aims To Help Disabled Peopleconnect.
</h3>
<p>  
 A free smartphone app that can help disabled people find and
 connect with others in their community and request social
 support has been launched in the UK.
</p>
<p>  
 MiFinder combines elements of social networking platforms
 with GPS satellite location, allowing users to engage and
 potentially meet with people nearby them who share similar
 interests. The app has a range of potential uses – including
 dating – but is unusual in promoting its use for social support,
 its owner says.
</p>
<p>  
 Users create a profile on the app and can choose to input
 personal information, including whether they consider
 themselves disabled. Users then write a short description of
 why they are using the app – for dating, to make new friends,
 or to find social support if they feel isolated – and the kind of
 people they hope to connect with. The app then shows where
 other MiFinder users with similar profiles are located, including
 those who may be in the same area at the same time. Users can
 switch off their precise location if they do not feel comfortable
 disclosing it to others.
</p>
<p>  
 MiFinder founder and CEO Gabriel Saclain told E-Access
 Bulletin that he hopes that eventually, if enough users join, the
 app will provide a unique means of engagement for people
 who may be isolated and lack the opportunity to meet others
 near where they live.
</p>
<p>  
 “I did know of other location-based apps which were much
 more focused on dating and things like that, but I felt there was
 a need for something which was much more community-
 focused, that allows people to get to know other people in real-
 time, using GPS”, Saclain said.
</p>
<p>  
 As well as allowing users to build up social connections and
 engage with similar communities nearby, MiFinder will be
 developed to give support groups – such as organisations that
 offer support to disabled people, for example – a real-time
 presence, he said.

<h3 id="i157-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Cynthia Waddell:</h3>
<p>  A wave of tributes has followed the sad death in April of accessible web design pioneer Cynthia
 Waddell, who will be deeply missed by the world technology
 community. Waddell contributed hugely to advancing the
 cause of IT equality for disabled people in the US, writing the
 country’s first accessible web design standard in 1995. These
 paved the way for Electronic and Information Technology
 Accessibility Standards legislation, known as Section 508,
 which used the public procurement process to have a huge
 impact on how technology companies design their products
 and services. Cynthia also founded and was executive director
 of the International Center for Disability Resources on the
 Internet, which under her leadership has tirelessly championed
 universal design and equal opportunities:

<p>  Keith Paterson, a volunteer web trainer for older people, posted onto our website following last issue’s
 piece on training courses for blind and visually impaired
 people on the “Georgie” package of smartphone apps that can
 help with communication.
</p>
<p>  
 His comment relates to his own imaginative idea about possible
 new digital technologies to help people with impaired hearing,
 building beyond the world of mobile apps to Google glasses.
</p>
<p>  
 “I have good vision but my hearing is almost gone”, Paterson
 writes. “Fortunately I have a cochlear implant which is a
 tremendous help. However it is very surprising to me that I
 have yet to see a proposal for Google glasses to be used in
 connection with speech recognition so I can SEE what people
 are saying.
</p>
<p>  
 “With a billion hard-of-hearing people worldwide there is a
 great need for this and it is something I have been pushing for
 over ten years. Speech recognition on things like this iPad I use
 has come on tremendously, so it is just a question of time
 before Google or someone catches on. But the glasses are more
 likely to sell to gadget freaks who want to show off or watch
 the sport while walking around!”

<h3 id="i157-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: QUAIL Concerns:</h3>
<p>  Following the piece in our last issue “Web Content Accessibility Checker Pitched At Wider
 Audience”, which described an updated version of free web
 content accessibility checker QUAIL ( <a href="http://quailjs.org/">http://quailjs.org/</a>
 ), reader Steve Faulkner posted onto our website with some
 concerns.
</p>
<p>  
 “While the concept of QUAIL is interesting, the default
 guideline set contains a significant amount of tests that are out
 of date or incorrect, which may lead developers into
 unnecessary code additions or additions that do not have the
 desired benefit”, Faulkner said.
</p>
<p>  
 “Until the default set of tests match reality QUAIL should be
 treated with extreme caution.”
</p>
<p>  
 However, Steve’s comment prompted a further reassuring
 response from Mike Gifford, President of Canadian open
 source web development group OpenConcept.
</p>
<p>  
 “This [QUAIL] is a great project, because it is open source”,
 Gifford said. “It does take a while to build and maintain any
 test. Folks should consider adding to the issue queue if they
 find tests that are insufficient:
 https://github.com/kevee/quail/issues
</p>
<p>  
 “It’s a great start to get content editors more aware of the
 accessibility challenges of their work. No automated tool will
 catch everything though.”

Section Three: Profile
- Erik Weihenmayer, Adventurer.
 
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Scaling The Heights Of Possibility.</h3>
<p>  
 Erik Weihenmayer has climbed Mount Everest, the world’s
 highest mountain, and descended Mount Elbrus, the highest
 peak in Europe, skiing to base camp. Now he is preparing to
 ride the rapids of the Grand Canyon’s Colorado River in a
 kayak. Extreme sports always offer extreme challenges, but for
 Weihenmayer, the level of difficulty is different: he is blind,
 after contracting retinoschisis at the age of three.
</p>
<p>  
 Weihenmayer, 44, an American of German origin, lost his sight
 gradually until his eyes were removed as a teenager and as a
 young man, to be replaced with prosthetics. “I was not afraid
 of going blind, but of ending up marginalised,” he told Lukas
 Eberle, a writer at the German newspaper “Der Spiegel”.
 “Sometimes it’s frustrating, it’s a daily struggle with yourself
 and with your limitations that you would almost pull out your
 hair,” said Weihenmayer.
</p>
<p>  
 After graduating with honours he took a teaching job, but soon
 decided the quiet life was not for him.
</p>
<p>  
 “At the end of the 90s I decided to take the plunge and to
 devote myself to sports”, Weihenmayer says. He began by
 climbing Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North
 America, then Kilimanjaro. But that wasn’t enough; nothing
 seemed to satisfy his desire to prove to himself and to others
 his ability to achieve what seemed to be impossible.
 Accompanied by a helper, he went to Vietnam with a mountain
 bike tandem, and rode across the country for 1,740 km.
</p>
<p>  
 Today Weihenmayer relates his exploits at meetings and
 conferences where tens of thousands of people come to listen.
 He is in demand everywhere, from his native US to Hong
 Kong, Thailand, Chile and Germany.
</p>
<p>  
 “There are some days in your life when everything is as
 difficult as if you were blind and had to climb a mountain”, he
 says. “But you must not be defeated by those days. They can
 transform you into pioneers, they can make you turn lead into
 gold”. Weihenmayer earns a good living as a lay preacher of
 the courage to live: only Bill Clinton and a few other speakers
 are paid more than him.
</p>
<p>  
 His most extreme adventure was climbing Mount Everest, the
 roof of the world. Erik’s Nepalese Sherpas, seeing him move
 easily and nimbly, could not believe that he was blind. They
 tried to gently take away the snow and the ice from his face to
 check if he could see, and in the end he had to take out one of
 his artificial eyes and show them his empty orbit to persuade
 them.
</p>
<p>  
 Being a sightless champion of extreme sports is tough.
 Weihenmayer has developed some personal techniques and
 systems: when climbing a mountain, he wears special
 sunglasses with an integrated minicam, transmitting signals to a
 sensor. This sensor is connected to his tongue by a cable, and
 he has learned to use it to recognise the shape of rocks. When
 skiing or racing, he always has a helper, but he has learned to
 distinguish between each type of soil, from sand to asphalt, by
 the sound of his footsteps and the surrounding noises.
</p>
<p>  
 “I partially put my life in the hands of others, of those who
 accompany me; only sport can give me this special feeling of
 confidence”, he says. “When I am on a mountain, or in the
 most remote places, I take a great delight in this feeling, as I
 cannot see the splendid views around me.”
</p>
<p>  
 Weihenmayer has founded a charity, “Soldiers to Summits”,
 which organises climbing groups with veterans from Iran or
 Afghanistan, some of whom are blind, have lost their limbs or
 experienced severe trauma. He gives them back the extreme
 but normal sensations of life by climbing mountains from
 Nepal to Ecuador.
</p>
<p>  
 Now, for his latest feat in the Grand Canyon, Weihenmayer is
 being trained by US Olympic canoeist Casey Eichfeld. “I help
 him to control his feelings and nerves while going down with
 the kayak,” Eichfeld says, but when asked if he would ever
 come down the rapids of the Colorado blindfolded, the
 Olympian is clear. “Absolutely not. Never!”
