<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Paralympics Effect ‘Challenges Perceptions Of Disabled People’</h3>
<p> 
 The impact of the 2012 Paralympic Games on public attitudes towards disabled 
 people has been positive but some campaign groups have sought to “misuse” it 
 for political ends, a leading activist told this year’s eAccess conference.
</p>
<p> 
 And disability consultant and campaigner Simon Stevens told delegates that 
 while the London Games had raised the profile of disability issues, it would 
 take some time before we could judge whether the effect will be lasting.
</p>
<p> 
 Stevens was addressing e-Access ’13, the UK’s leading event on access to 
 technology by disabled people, organised by E-Access Bulletin publisher 
 Headstar. He criticised the way some charities used the Paralympics 
 alongside “anti-government rhetoric”, for example. “They argue that for the 
 average disabled person, the Paralympics has not distracted from the 
 supposed hardship that disabled people face from this Government’s welfare 
 reforms”, Stevens said. “This use of the Games to promote a prejudiced 
 victimhood viewpoint… is unhelpful.”
</p>
<p> 
 However he said the true value of the Games for the image of disabled people 
 in the UK lies somewhere between positive and negative views. “I believe it 
 is important that we see the Paralympics are just as one factor of many that 
 has assisted to raise the profile of disability issues… The politics of 
 disability has peaked and the Paralympics has been a part of them, adding 
 another dimension to the public’s understanding of disability, contrasting 
 the media’s portrayal of disabled people as vulnerable and or freaks.”
</p>
<p> 
 It would take some time to assess the Games’ true legacy, Stevens said. “The 
 trick will be how to be keep this going in the long-term, and use it to 
 challenge the perceptions of disabled people as merely vulnerable objects of 
 pity. I fear the public still see disabled people as a single homogeneous 
 group, who all think the same… We must start showing that disabled people 
 are diverse individuals that have their own unique wants, desires, 
 aspirations, goals, likes and dislikes...The Games must be seem as a part of 
 a wider informal movement of action that is helping disabled people to 
 achieve their status as fully contributing citizens.”
</p>
<p> 
 Conference keynote speaker Hannah Cockroft MBE – world-record-holding 
 wheelchair sprint racer and winner of two gold medals at London 2012 – said 
 the rise of the internet and social media had helped boost athletes’ 
 profiles. The video sharing site YouTube, for example, had hosted short 
 films on individual athletes and their training. “It really made people 
 watch and take notice of our abilities for the first time,” Cockroft said. 
 “It helped bring the Paralympics out of the Olympic shadow and celebrate us 
 [Paralympians] as elite athletes. It really made people watch and [see] our 
 abilities for the first time... what we could do instead of what we can’t 
 do.”
</p>
<p> 
 Cockroft said interest in Paralympians had carried on into 2013, partly due 
 to the extensive media coverage the Games had received. It was essential for 
 this kind of exposure to continue, she said, “because otherwise a nation 
 seems to be able to forget the Paralympians pretty quickly.”

<h3 id="i163-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Care Home Workers ‘Lack Digital Confidence And Skills’</h3>
<p> 
 Many people who work with older people and disabled people in care homes 
 lack digital skills and are poorly placed to help residents use the internet 
 and other vital tools, eAccess 13 delegates heard.
</p>
<p> 
 “We often find that the people who work with those in care are not 
 particularly confident or skilled in their use of digital,” said Miles 
 Maier, ICT champion at LASA, an organisation which helps charities and 
 voluntary groups use technology.
</p>
<p> 
 To address this gap LASA has launched the Connected Care project, helping 
 not-for-profit social care providers such as independent living centres, 
 care homes and day care centres to use ICT more effectively, Maier said. 
 Under the scheme, which has been funded by the Department of Health for 
 three years, organisations receive an ICT ‘health check’ and an action plan 
 to help staff become more digitally aware and boost skills.
</p>
<p> 
 The end goal is to enable those receiving social care to use technology more 
 effectively, he said, allowing them to communicate with family and friends 
 and have more control over their own care. “Our working theory is by 
 providing people in social care with access to e-skills and digital 
 technology, it is empowering and it is enabling,” Maier said.
</p>
<p> 
 In a complementary project the Disabled Living Foundation (DLF), which 
 provides information on independent living, has launched a “Living Made 
  Easy” web resource, offering impartial advice on assistive products and 
 technology to everyone, the conference heard.
</p>
<p> 
 Ed Mylles, director of business development at the charity, said the 
 resource is split into eight sections, including house and home; mobility 
 and walking; leisure; and communication.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can browse a wide range of communications technologies and products 
 including text-to-speech programmes, magnifiers, conversion amplifiers for 
 hearing aids and mouse and keyboard alternatives.
</p>
<p> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport supported the development of the 
 communication section including ICT access, helping to “widen the product 
 area and specifically work on including software products”, Mylles said.
</p>
<p> 
 The communications section of Living Made Easy now contains details of more 
 than 250 software products with prices and specification, as well as listing 
 relevant ICT organisations that can provide further advice and support, he 
 said.

<h3 id="i163-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Standards Developers Urged To Support Older And Disabled People</h3>
<p> 
 People working on technical standards for mainstream products and services 
 must be more aware of the needs of older and disabled people, delegates at 
 eAccess 13 heard in a closing session in speakers raised key points for the 
 future of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Gill Whitney, head of the Design for All Research Group at Middlesex 
 University, said that in a recent survey of committee members by the British 
 Standards Institution, only one third answered ‘yes’ to the question: “Do 
 any of your standardisation activities involve the standardisation of 
 products or services where the accessibility for older and disabled people 
 needs to be considered?”
</p>
<p> 
 However, almost four-fifths of respondents (76.7%) had said yes to the 
 question: “Do any of your standardisation activities involve the 
 standardisation of products or services which are designed to be used by 
 people?”
</p>
<p> 
 In an ageing society, these answers make no sense together, Whitney said, 
 since all standards for people are also standards for older and disabled 
 people. One development that might help is the current revision of the 
 international standards creation guidance ISO/IEC Guide 71:2001, she said: 
 guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons 
 and persons with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “Embrace mobile first” was another key point presented by Jonathan Hassell, 
 former head of accessibility at the BBC and founder of Hassell Inclusion.
</p>
<p> 
 “For me, the most natural place for somebody with any type of impairment to 
 get a better experience of the world is through a mobile device. It’s the 
 one thing they have with them all of the time, [that] they will depend on 
 for absolutely everything,” Hassell said. “If you are not thinking about 
 accessibility and mobile you’ve got it completely back to front.”
</p>
<p> 
 Mel Findlater, Director of The You Can Hub, made a similar point when she 
 took to the stage dressed in a cardboard box. “As a society, we put people 
 with disabilities in boxes all the time” Findlater said. “Technology, 
 especially mobile technology, has real potential to help people with 
 disabilities step out of their boxes. Can we start thinking in that way, 
 co-design with people and help people step out of their boxes?”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Conference Report- eAccess 13: Debate.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: The Price Of Software Freedomby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 With some assistive technology software such as specialist text-to-speech 
 screenreaders being relatively expensive to buy, moves have been underway 
 for some time to widen the role that free and open source software can play 
 in supporting the IT needs of people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 However, while free software sounds like a great idea – and an even better 
 price – its development is not always so straightforward, delegates heard at 
 the recent eAccess 13 conference in London.
</p>
<p> 
 A discussion group chaired by University of Southampton internet research 
 fellow EA Draffan focused on “the exciting expansion in the number of 
 strategies involving free and open source software that can support access 
 to technology”. It set out to examine “the robustness of this type of 
 software; ongoing support and maintenance issues and whether this is a 
 feasible route for government and other organisations to take in the long 
 term.”
</p>
<p> 
 Free and open source software are notoriously hard to define, but in general 
 terms, free software can mean both that which has no cost to the user, and 
 software which people are free to adapt for their own ends. Open source 
 software (which is sometimes, but not always, also free in either or both 
 senses) is software whose source code is published so everyone can see it. 
 There are various overlaps between these categories, and many varieties of 
 copyright licence under which software can be distributed so as to remain 
 “free”, but on the whole both free and open source software are either no 
 cost or much lower cost to use than proprietary, specialist assistive 
 software which only the developers or owners can sell or licence.
</p>
<p> 
 Free and open source software has advantages other than price: the ability 
 for others to adapt it means, for example, that software produced in one 
 language can be taken by another group and translated into another language. 
 And its functionality can be tweaked to suit new groups of users by 
 volunteer developer communities, often working together using online code 
 exchange and development platforms, such as GitHub and SourceForge.
</p>
<p> 
 Sounds good, but the fact is there has been a surprisingly low level of free 
 and open source software to emerge in the assistive technology arena, 
 Draffan said. “There is lots of good free software in other sectors – what 
 is stopping us in assistive technology?”
</p>
<p> 
 One of the main problems is funding, she said. Although developing software 
 can be relatively affordable, open source software needs to have a community 
 of users built around it to help maintain and strengthen the code, Draffan 
 said. “You have to build your community, to blog, tweet – you have got to 
 have your community stay with you. How do you do that? It is terribly time 
 consuming, and without money, you can’t sustain it.
</p>
<p> 
 “The actual capital expense of developing something is 33% or even less of 
 total cost. The real money goes on promotion and marketing.”
</p>
<p> 
 Some projects are supported by companies who allow their paid developers 
 time to support voluntary open source projects. Google, for example, allows 
 its engineers a certain percentage of their time to pursue creative projects 
 such as writing open source software; and many other giant IT companies such 
 as IBM support social projects.
</p>
<p> 
 For individual projects, however, support can still be a problem. And there 
 are other barriers, too: free software licences sound simple but there are 
 so many variations such as BSD and GNU that the field can be hard to 
 understand, Draffan said. This matters: getting each licence exactly right 
 to suit the aims of each project is “horrendously important”, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Other issues include inevitable limitations to projects supported by 
 volunteer communities: commercial tools, while they tend to be more 
 expensive, often have access to better development funding and hence are 
 generally more fully-featured and support more standard platforms, Draffan 
 said. Open source software, on the other hand, often does part of a job very 
 well, or supports one operating system or web browser well, but does not 
 work so well across the board, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 But isn’t the world big enough for all kinds of software? Or, as Draffan put 
 it, “Can we achieve a nirvana where we have a two-tier system?”
</p>
<p> 
 To do that, we need more encouragement for open innovation, she said. This 
 could partly be achieved by promoting existing success stories, to fire 
 people’s imaginations, and also by wider distribution of the free and open 
 source assistive technology that already exists. “I give a pen drive with 
 free assistive technology to new students – why is someone not doing it for 
 people in care homes?”
</p>
<p> 
 The government may have a useful role to play here, and does support some 
 open source software because it wants to avoid supplier lock-in and control, 
 Draffan said. However, this support has so far mainly concentrated on 
 well-established platforms and tools such as web content management 
 software, she said, “whereas with assistive technology, we are asking for 
 someone to create something new.”
</p>
<p> 
 One answer might be to look for software projects that have already been 
 started but need support to reach the next level, she said. “We need to look 
 for something already sitting there that is waiting to tip, that needs a bit 
 of a nudge, so you can validate it, you can say here is what we think is the 
 most promising one.”
</p>
<p> 
 The results will definitely be worth it, she said, in an ageing society. 
 Some might think assistive technology is a small area of software 
 development aimed at a small user community, she said, “but is it? If I am 
 thinking of 25% of population that is getting old, it is not so small.”
