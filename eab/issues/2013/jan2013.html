<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Elderly Needs Study Could Be First “Crowdfunded”Social Research
</h3>
<p> 
 A study into the consumer needs of elderly and disabled
 residents of a UK town could be the UK’s first piece of social
 research to be “crowdfunded”, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The project was developed by the non-profit campaign group
 Eastbourne Designed For All (
 <a href="http://www.eastbournedesignedforall.co.uk/">http://www.eastbournedesignedforall.co.uk/</a>
 ), which aims to pass on advice to businesses in the Sussex town on how to
 design products and services to be as accessible as possible to
 the area’s high proportion of elderly and disabled residents.
</p>
<p> 
 A local company has offered to carry out the market research
 study, “Understanding Eastbourne’s Needs”, for a discounted
 fee of &pound;4,200. Eastbourne Designed For All is now using the
 crowdfunding website “Peoplefund.it” ( <a href="http://bit.ly/13mXaFT">http://bit.ly/13mXaFT</a>

 ) to source this fee.
</p>
<p> 
 Each project on the site is allocated a target fund figure and
 deadline, with backers offered rewards from the project team
 depending on the size of their pledge, such as (in the case of
 the Eastbourne project) free consultancy from a local business
 support organisation. Pledges will only be cashed in if the full
 target sum is met by the deadline.
</p>
<p> 
 Tom Serpell, founder and director of Designed For All, told E-
 Access Bulletin the project is the first time in the UK that
 crowdfunding had been used to fund research, but that it
 seemed the logical choice for an organisation like theirs.
</p>
<p> 
 “Because we are a social enterprise we’re not funded, and it’s
 difficult to raise money, so we decided crowdsourcing might
 be the way forward. It provides new ways of linking people.
 We’re hoping to make Eastbourne the UK’s first ‘inclusive
 town’ as a result of the work.”
</p>
<p> 
 If the project is commissioned, Serpell expects the results to
 build on findings from previous research conducted by
 Designed For All partner the University of Brighton, which
 revealed that town infrastructures can be difficult to negotiate
 for elderly and disabled residents, due to features such as high
 pavement curbs and signage being difficult to read for those
 with visual impairments. At time of writing, Understanding
 Eastbourne’s Needs had received &pound;850 of its &pound;4,200 target,
 with 22 days remaining until the deadline.
</p>
<p> 
 Online crowdfunding is becoming an increasingly popular
 method of acquiring funds for social and community projects,
 with other platforms such as Spacehive also growing in
 prominence.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: User Priorities Must Drive Accessible Ict Research,Warns Telecoms Expert
</h3>
<p> 
 Research and investment priorities for the digital economy and
 development of internet services and mobile devices must
 reflect the needs of disabled and elderly people, a
 telecommunications expert has warned.
</p>
<p> 
 In a video address to a London event on the future of
 accessible ICT research
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/T0SkH2">http://bit.ly/T0SkH2</a>
 ), Dr Mike Short, vice president of Telefónica Europe and former president of the Institution of
 Engineering and Technology, said customer demand for more
 accessible services has risen over the past ten years.
 Accordingly, mobile network providers need to think about
 different groups of users when planning for future growth,
 including the benefits that universal design can offer to
 everybody, Short said.
</p>
<p> 
 Internet access from mobile devices is also increasing, and
 developments in smartphones and tablets have made it easier
 for people with a sensory impairment to use these devices, said
 Short, citing larger screens, more adjustable font sizes and
 increased use of touch-screen technology.
</p>
<p> 
 However, direct information from these groups on their
 priorities when using digital services and mobile devices is
 needed to aid research and ensure that future services are
 developed appropriately, he said. “What we don’t always have
 is the right range of inputs or priorities from the accessibility
 community, those people who are in some way suffering
 difficulties through hearing or seeing or other issues”.
</p>
<p> 
 Similar input is also needed from people who are ageing and
 people with long-term health conditions, Short told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin before the event, he said mobile
 apps needed to become more “generation-friendly”. “We need
 to move towards a world of inclusion and internet for all,
 where we’re talking about everybody having access and a
 much more inclusive range of digital services available”.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Autism Communication App Wins Smart Accessibilityaward
</h3>
<p> 
 A Spanish developer who created an app to help his five-year-
 old autistic son communicate has won 50,000 euros at the
 second annual “Smart Accessibility” awards for Android
 smartphone apps, presented by the Vodafone Foundation.
</p>
<p> 
 Ablah ( <a href="http://bit.ly/10JJ5F6">http://bit.ly/10JJ5F6</a>
 ) is an augmentative communication application developed by Juan Carlos
 Gonzalez. Users select images, text and sounds on a touch-
 screen to make the device “speak” for them.
</p>
<p> 
 Ablah was one of four category winners at the 2013 awards,
 topping the ‘Wellbeing’ category.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘Mobility’ category was won by the Jaccede app (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/VF0kT1">http://bit.ly/VF0kT1</a>
 ), which allows users to search for locations that are accessible to people with a disability.
 Information is displayed on features such as step-free
 entrances to buildings and whether accessible toilets are
 available, and users can contribute their own accessible
 locations.
</p>
<p> 
 The Happen app ( <a href="http://bit.ly/VF2n9J">http://bit.ly/VF2n9J</a>
 ), winner of the Independent Living category, is a customisable tool aimed at
 those with a visual impairment and the elderly. It allows users
 to easily search for popular online information such as news
 and weather, and then choose the format they receive it in. For
 example, someone with a visual impairment may choose to
 have the information spoken to them.
</p>
<p> 
 The fourth category, Social Participation, was won by Starting
 Blocks ( <a href="http://bit.ly/R6JETT">http://bit.ly/R6JETT</a>
 ). This app teaches basic mobile technology skills through eight lessons, which guide users
 through key functions of touch-screen technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The awards, co-organised by the AGE Platform Europe
 network and the European Disability Network, form part of the
 Vodafone Foundation’s Mobile For Good programme, which
 supports global community projects using mobile technology.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Profile- Karen Darke, Adventurer and Paralympian
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: A Thirst For Adventureby Tristan Parker
</h3>
<p> 
 Paralympic athlete and adventurer Karen Darke has always
 been a keen sports and outdoor enthusiast. At the age of 21 she
 became paralysed from the chest down after a climbing
 accident, but this did nothing to quell her passion for
 adventure. Over the coming years she undertook numerous
 intrepid – and often dangerous – trips across the globe before
 training for the 2012 Paralympic Games, where she competed
 as a member of the British Cycling Team.
</p>
<p> 
 Darke took part in several handcycling events at the London
 Games, including the road race over 48km (where she captured
 the headlines by crossing the finish line hand-in-hand with
 British team-mate Rachel Morris) and the road time trial over
 16km, in which she earned a silver medal. Recently, she has
 supported Go ON Gold, a national campaign to raise awareness
 of the importance of access to technology by disabled people.
 Tristan Parker (TP) caught up with her (no mean feat) to ask
 her about her life, plans and greatest achievements:
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Please give us some background information on yourself,
 and how you became interested in sports.
</p>
<p> 
 KD: I started into outdoor sports when I was at school.
 Climbing, caving, running, etc. This carried on with walking
 holidays with my parents, a youth expedition when I was 17,
 and mountain biking.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Did your accident at 21-years-old change your outlook on
 life and how you wanted to approach sporting achievements?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: I don’t think so. I was already keen on sport and the
 outdoors so that didn’t change, but I was lucky to have a circle
 of friends who enjoyed those activities and were willing to help
 me find new ways to do them. A close friend died in a
 climbing accident only a few months after my own accident
 and that had an impact on me – it made me think about what I
 could do instead of what I couldn’t.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: In the 2012 Paralympics you represented Great Britain in
 handcycling, but you also take part in many other activities and
 sports – is cycling something that you have a particular affinity
 with?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: Yes, I’ve always been a keen cyclist, though before my
 accident I preferred not to be on the roads, but on a mountain
 bike (now a really old-fashioned one without suspension!).
 Really, though, I just enjoy anything that takes you into the
 outdoors, but particularly where you get to be in a different
 position from sat in a wheelchair, feeling the wind in your hair,
 your lungs working… You get the idea.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Do you use any kinds of technology on a regular basis?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: A Mac laptop, iPhone and internet connectivity all the
 time. It’s kind of central to my work and life now.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Has technology made living with a disability any easier for
 you?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: Not IT particularly, though it perhaps opens more areas of
 work up, given that you don’t have to be able to walk to use
 technology.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: What kinds of barriers do you think that people with
 disabilities face in accessing and using technology and getting
 online? What could be done to remove these barriers?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: Cost would be a barrier to some, and hassle of getting set
 up. Maybe also the support to use equipment. I would love to
 use more than I do on my laptop – make movies, etc, but lack
 of time and know-how prevent me. Perhaps having access to
 an IT buddy would be good – though I’m sure it would be
 good for everybody, regardless of disability.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: And what kinds of benefits can technology access and
 getting online bring to people with disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: It does help being able to access information, online
 forums and websites so easily. I can get whatever information
 is available about equipment developments, opinions, etc, in an
 instant. When I was first injured, computers weren’t so
 common, and accessing information was harder. IT is a great
 way of connecting up a minority group, e.g. into sport and with
 a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: What would you say have been your greatest or most
 significant achievements over the years?
</p>
<p> 
 KD:
 - Staying positive.
 - Training for the Paralympics and committing 100% to it – and
 being fitter than ever at age 41.
 - Overcoming barriers and challenges with groups of friends to
 complete some amazing journeys (sea kayaking from Canada
 to Alaska, skiing across Greenland...)
</p>
<p> 
 TP: How did it feel to win a medal at the 2012 Paralympics?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: Relief. I worked really hard for it and gave it 100 per cent
 and more for the two years prior, so it was a relief that the hard
 work paid off and brought a medal home. Shame it wasn’t a
 Gold one, but it’s also good to have goals to chase! It’s very
 special having the medal though, mainly because children love
 it, so I love sharing it with them – seeing their faces light up
 and hearing about their goals and aspirations.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: What do you have planned for the future? And are you
 hoping to take part in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games?
</p>
<p> 
 KD: I’m staying on the cycling squad. I’m also dabbling in
 paratriathlon, as I was out at the World Championships in New
 Zealand in October, and ended up winning. I enjoy the variety
 with swimming and wheelchair racing as it’s been pretty
 dedicated cycling, cycling, cycling for a while! However, my
 main commitment is still to the bike, and I’m on the British
 Cycling squad going forward with a view to Rio. But in 2013
 we hope to ‘snow-bike’ from the edge of Antarctica to the
 South Pole, and raise a big chunk of money for Back Up (a
 charity that transforms lives after spinal cord injury). The
 website is www.poleofpossibility.com. We need a nice
 corporate sponsor to make it happen, but in the meantime
 we’re on a training trip to Norway in January.
