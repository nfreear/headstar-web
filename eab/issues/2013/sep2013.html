<h3 id="i161-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Top E-Book Reader Firms Contest Us Accessibility Law.</h3>
<p> 
 Three of the biggest e-book reader manufacturers – Amazon, Kobo and Sony – 
 have petitioned the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ask for 
 exemptions from US laws requiring products to be accessible to users with 
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The three are urging the commission to waive parts of the 21st Century Video 
 and Communications and Video Accessibility Act which require any product 
 offering ‘advanced communication services’ (ACS) to be “accessible to and 
 usable by individuals with disabilities.” The manufacturers say that as 
 e-readers are used almost exclusively for reading, they do not provide more 
 generic ACS. They argue that to make them fully accessible would increase 
 their cost and weight and decrease battery life, essentially turning them 
 into different devices more similar to tablet computers.
</p>
<p> 
 “Individuals with disabilities have better ACS options on devices other than 
 e-readers” the petition says. It also states that if accessibility functions 
 were added to the e-readers, these changes “would not yield a meaningful 
 benefit to individuals with disabilities”.
</p>
<p> 
 However Steve Tyler, head of solutions, strategy and planning at the Royal 
 National Institute of Blind People in the UK, told E-Access Bulletin that 
 e-readers should be made accessible to all, since they are “game-changing 
 technologies” for blind and partially sighted people. “Tenuous arguments 
 around an increase in weight or low battery life of devices are simply not 
 justified nor representative of the truth around the state of play in the 
 technology market today”, Tyler said.
</p>
<p> 
 “Rendering these devices fully accessible through synthetic speech, as well 
 as options around font size and contrast, is a business decision rather than 
 one based on technology,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The coalition of e-reader manufacturers’ petition is available as a PDF at 
 the following link: <a href="http://bit.ly/16gW53i">http://bit.ly/16gW53i</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Public comments on the petition were invited by the FCC last month, the 
 overwhelming majority of which opposed the coalition’s waiver request. More 
 than 500 comments were sent in all, viewable at: <a href="http://bit.ly/16wWHEo">http://bit.ly/16wWHEo</a>

</p>
<p> 
 The commission will now consider the submissions before reaching its 
 decision on whether or not to accept a waiver. At the time of writing, no 
 date had been set for this decision.

<h3 id="i161-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessibility Now Thriving In Mainstream Mobile Market, Campaigner Says</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility functions on mobile devices are becoming mainstream and mobile 
 manufacturers are now competing to make their devices more accessible, the 
 president of international digital accessibility body G3ict has said.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the M-Enabling Australasia 2013 event in Australia, Axel Leblois 
 said accessibility has become a driving force in the mobile market.
</p>
<p> 
 “For the first time in my entire life in the industry, I see that major 
 vendors are competing for accessibility. That is because everyone, every 
 day, who uses a smartphone, living with a disability or not, is going to 
 encounter an instant of disability”, Leblois said.
</p>
<p> 
 He said anyone might encounter a temporary impairment when using their 
 mobile device, such as not being able to see the screen in some situations 
 or relying on writing and reading text when the user cannot make phone 
 calls.
</p>
<p> 
 “Those [accessibility] features – so important for people with 
 disabilities – are essential for most users today. That’s why you see such 
 competition and why you see iOS and Windows competing for the best 
 accessibility features”, Leblois said.
</p>
<p> 
 Businesses are also increasingly seeing the business case for making their 
 digital products accessible, he said. “Why would a microwave oven not have 
 voice controls, since it will be so cheap, because it’s becoming digitised 
 in the mobile industry?” he said. “[Accessibility] has a profound effect on 
 everything.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Paralympics Star Is This Year’S E-Access Conference Keynote Speaker.</h3>
<p> 
 GB Paralympics star Hannah Cockroft MBE, winner of two gold medals at the 
 London 2012 Paralympic Games in wheelchair sprint races, is this year’s 
 inspirational keynote speaker at e-Access ‘13, the UK’s leading event on 
 access to technology by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The event will analyse the ‘Paralympics effect’, focusing on how increased 
 public and media interest in disability after the 2012 Paralympic Games can 
 be used to maximum benefit for accessibility progress. Other speakers 
 include Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative industries Ed 
 Vaizey, who will update delegates on how the government is addressing 
 accessibility; and disability consultant and campaigner Simon Stevens, star 
 of a Channel Four TV comedy show.
</p>
<p> 
 Elsewhere on the agenda, topics include user-testing by people with 
 disabilities; access to mobile technologies including smartphones, tablets 
 and apps; e-book accessibility; achieving management support for digital 
 inclusion strategies; accessible open source technologies; and accessibility 
 of ‘PDF’ files.
</p>
<p> 
 The event, hosted by E-Access Bulletin publishers Headstar in association 
 with the One Voice for Accessible ICT Coalition, is to be held in central 
 London on 31 October. For the ninth year running, it brings together users, 
 practitioners, suppliers and academics from across the field to discuss how 
 technology can be used by and benefit people of all ages and abilities.

<p>  Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, from the Kingston upon  Thames Association for the Blind, writes in following last issue’s piece on 
 the new guidelines for mobile accessibility issued by the BBC.
</p>
<p> 
 “I do applaud the BBC trying to do something about mobile access”, Brian 
 writes. “I would however take issue with the BBC claim that their web site 
 is accessible. Well, it is in the sense that most of its clever bits do work 
 for screenreader users, but to me, rather like Amazon and others, they are a 
 perfect demonstration on how to pass the accessibility criteria while making 
 it hard to use.
</p>
<p> 
 “It is far, far too busy on each page. All the time you have to click to 
 read the rest of items of news, or go there to look at this similar item 
 etc, and it is just really hard sometimes to actually stay reading what you 
 want to read without distractions.
</p>
<p> 
 “To me it’s what happens when the nuts and bolts are all correct, but the 
 design is a real pig. I know I’m not alone in thinking this, but 
 unfortunately when folk complain (assuming they can find the right form to 
 do it on), they get ignored or the answer comes weeks later on and is just 
 an excuse about why it is as it is. Let us hope the content writers and 
 authors looking at mobile access guidelines do not have the same ‘more is 
 better’ approach.”

<p>

Section Three: Global view

</p>
<p>  the fight for equality in Canada and  worldwide
 by Donna Jodhan.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2000 I embarked on a journey to encourage the Canadian Government to work 
 with blind Canadians to make their websites more accessible to all 
 Canadians. At that time, my main objective was to raise awareness of the 
 inaccessibility of government websites, and to convince officials of the 
 importance of making their websites fully accessible as soon as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 I started my mission by taking my concerns to various departmental heads 
 within the government and my presentations focused on the importance of 
 making information fully accessible to all Canadians. I focused specifically 
 on the fact that we are now living in an information society and a 
 knowledge-based economy and blind Canadians, like everyone else, needed 
 immediate access to information to make vital everyday decisions that 
 affected such things as our health, safety, security and social welfare.
</p>
<p> 
 By making websites more accessible they could enable blind Canadians to 
 read, download and to respond to information independently and without 
 sighted assistance, thus protecting their right to privacy and 
 confidentiality. To this end, I told the civil servants they needed to give 
 their website developers the tools to make website content accessible and 
 readable to blind persons, to produce files in alternate formats, and to 
 provide training to support staff to be of assistance to blind Canadians. I 
 also told them about the benefits to all Canadians if websites were to be 
 made fully accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Where could they find the necessary expertise to accomplish all this? 
 Through the advice and assistance of blind testers and users along with 
 guidance from accessibility experts, both nationally and internationally.
</p>
<p> 
 By 2004, however, I was struggling to make much headway, and I had come to 
 the conclusion that to have any effect on the Canadian Government, my 
 one-person mission would have to be expanded to include support from other 
 blind Canadians, as well as from organisations of and for blind people. My 
 challenge was not just inaccessible websites, but a deep-seated attitude 
 that did not understand why blind Canadians needed to have equal access to 
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 Eventually, this mission turned into a legal battle, triggered in particular 
 after Statistics Canada refused to consider my job application on an equal 
 footing to mainstream applicants, citing among its reasons that it was going 
 to be too costly to produce exams in Braille or in an electronic format.
</p>
<p> 
 The legal battle began in full in 2007 after I had consulted with David 
 Baker and his team at disability and human rights specialist lawyers 
 Bakerlaw, and with Jutta Treviranus, a leading international accessibility 
 expert and director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD [Ontario 
 College of Art and Design] University in Toronto.  I was extremely fortunate 
 to have obtained funding under a Court Challenges Program just before 
 funding to it was cut in July 2007. The basis for my case was a violation of 
 my rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights; unequal access to 
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 For the next five years, my lawyers and I, along with our accessibility 
 experts, battled doggedly to keep our case alive as the government battled 
 just as determinedly to have it thrown out of court. I received support from 
 thousands of Canadians, both blind and sighted, and from individuals and 
 organisations around the world. An online petition was launched by the 
 Alliance for Equality of Blind Canadians and we gathered more than 500 
 signatures. Press coverage extended from Canada to the US and well beyond, 
 including TV, radio, newspaper and internet coverage.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2010 I won a landmark victory, as the lower Federal Court ruled in my 
 favour, stating that the Canadian Government had indeed violated my rights 
 under the Canadian Charter of Rights. The government appealed but lost round 
 two of the battle in 2012 when the Canadian Court of Appeal again ruled in 
 my favour; three judges having handed down a unanimous decision.
</p>
<p> 
 That was the end of that episode of my story, but since then, matters have 
 moved on even further.
</p>
<p> 
 The Canadian Government has been mandated to make all of their websites 
 fully accessible but no time limit has been put on them to do this. A few 
 weeks ago the Alliance for Equality of Blind Canadians received an 
 invitation from the government to have its members test their websites and I 
 believe that this is a step in the right direction.
</p>
<p> 
 Many have asked why I embarked on such a long and arduous journey, and my 
 response is that I did it for all blind Canadians, but especially for blind 
 kids, as I truly believe I am obliged to make their future a better one than 
 mine. I owe a debt of gratitude to everyone who has helped and supported me, 
 with special mention to the Alliance for Equality of Blind Canadians, of 
 which I was the president from 2011-13.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, it is my hope that this project will remain a continual work in 
 progress: so thanks too to everyone who has yet to join in but might read 
 this and work out how to help in future.
