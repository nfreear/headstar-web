<h3 id="i162-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Uk Ignoring British Sign Language Video Technology, Analyst Warns.</h3>
<p> 
 Most British companies and government departments are ignoring new ways of 
 offering video links to British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters because 
 they misunderstand the value of this to deaf customers, a leading 
 practitioner has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Jeff McWhinney, chair of social enterprise SignVideo ( 
 <a href="http://www.signvideo.co.uk">http://www.signvideo.co.uk</a>
 ), was speaking following the launch of a trial  service by the broadcaster Sky, allowing deaf customers to contact the 
 company’s customer services team using SignVideo interpreters based in 
 London and Edinburgh.
</p>
<p> 
 The cloud-based service – run through Sky’s Accessibility website ( 
 <a href="http://www.sky.com/accessibility">http://www.sky.com/accessibility</a>
 ) – facilitates the call between a member  of Sky’s Accessible Customer Services team and the company’s customers, who 
 use their own webcam.
</p>
<p> 
 However, use of such services by major firms is all-too rare in the UK 
 despite advances in technology, McWhinney said, due to basic 
 misunderstandings about the need to offer them. “The technology has been 
 around for some time now, but there are a lot of misunderstandings about 
 sign language”, he said. “Most people think sign language is a visual form 
 of English, but that is not the case: it is actually a different language. 
 Its grammar and syntax are nothing like English. Sign language is actually 
 closer to languages in India in terms of word order, for instance.”
</p>
<p> 
 That misunderstanding creates a lot of barriers because companies usually 
 just say that deaf customers don’t need to sign, they can just send an 
 email, McWhinney said. The problem is, the average deaf person has a low 
 reading age, so in email exchanges there will be misunderstandings, he said. 
 “But when deaf people are able to use sign video as first language, they can 
 express themselves confidently.”
</p>
<p> 
 Sky is the only major broadcaster outside America to use this service, 
 McWhinney said, though one or two other UK firms such as BT and Lloyds Bank 
 have used it. “It is crucial for financial industry: in the past, deaf 
 people had to ask their neighbours and friends to phone in for them, and you 
 can imagine the security consequences of asking your neighbour to call the 
 bank for you.”
</p>
<p> 
 Around 40 UK local authorities also use the service, he said, in a similar 
 way to offering telephone language interpreter services to customers with 
 other spoken languages such as Polish or Hindi. But no central government 
 body is using SignVideo, McWhinney said, despite many such as HM Revenue &amp; 
 Customs being huge, customer-facing organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have major frustrations with HMRC: they refuse to speak to me via a third 
 party. On three occasions I have been fined &pound;100 for not filing a tax return 
 on time due to confusion over my password, and I couldn’t phone them, I had 
 to write to them and of course this meant the deadline was passed. All three 
 times I have had my fine refunded because it was obviously not my fault, but 
 all this just adds more bureaucracy.”
</p>
<p> 
 McWhinney said Sky has a good track record with deaf people who use BSL, as 
 one of the main funders for the BSL Broadcasting Trust which produces 
 independent content presented in sign language for the Community Channel on 
 Sky, Virgin Media, Freeview and BT Vision services.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Access To The Internet By Older People And Mobile Tips At Heart Of E-Access 13.
</h3>
<p> 
 Access to the internet in homes for the elderly and developing inclusive 
 services on smartphones and tablet computers are among topics on the agenda 
 at e-Access 13, the UK’s leading event on access to technology by people 
 with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Delegates will hear about the Connecting Care project, looking at how care 
 homes for older people can make the most of new technology to support their 
 organisation, carers and service users. The project is run by Lasa, a 
 technology support group for charities and public sector bodies, with 
 funding from the Department of Health.
</p>
<p> 
 Presenters of a mobile inclusion workshop include Shadi Abou-Zahra of the 
 World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
</p>
<p> 
 Mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, and Windows are rapidly evolving with 
 richer and more robust accessibility features and support, giving developers 
 more ways to create accessible mobile web applications, Abou-Zahra will say. 
 His workshop – co-presented with Jon Gibbins of Dotjay consulting – will 
 cover the accessibility features available on the major mobile platforms and 
 suggest strategies for integrating accessibility into mobile projects.
</p>
<p> 
 Elsewhere on the agenda, GB Paralympics star Hannah Cockroft MBE, winner of 
 two gold medals at London 2012, will help explore the ‘Paralympics effect’, 
 focusing on how increased public awareness of disability issues after the 
 2012 Paralympic Games can be used to maximum benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative industries Ed Vaizey will 
 update delegates on how the government is addressing accessibility, and 
 other speakers will cover a wide range of topics, including: user-testing of 
 websites by people with disabilities; e-book accessibility; and how people 
 can go about securing senior management support for digital inclusion 
 strategies.
</p>
<p> 
 The event, hosted by E-Access Bulletin publishers Headstar in association 
 with the One Voice for Accessible ICT Coalition, is held in central London 
 on 31 October. For more information and to secure your place, visit:

<h3 id="i162-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: ‘3d Search Engine’ Tested By Blind Tokyo Schoolchildren.</h3>
<p> 
 A voice-activated machine combining web search engine technology with 3D 
 printing is giving visually impaired school children in Tokyo the chance to 
 experiment with what could be a glimpse into the future for the creation of 
 live tactile teaching aids.
</p>
<p> 
 Called the ‘Hands On Search’, users speak the name of an object into the 
 machine which then searches the internet for modelling data. The 3D printer 
 then creates a miniature model of it, using materials such as plastic, 
 carbon and metal. If the machine cannot find enough modelling data, a 
 request for the data will be posted onto the Hands On Search public website.
</p>
<p> 
 Developed by Yahoo! Japan and Tokyo creative agency Hakuhodo Kettle, the 
 Hands On Search device is currently on free loan to the Special Needs 
 Education School for the Visually Impaired, a laboratory school of the 
 University of Tsukuba.
</p>
<p> 
 The aim is to allow children who cannot search the internet conventionally 
 an opportunity to experience the results of web searches through touch, as 
 opposed to vision. A video by Yahoo! Japan shows the machine printing out 
 small models of items whose names children have spoken into the machine, 
 such as a giraffe, dinosaur and the Tokyo Skytree, a landmark building in 
 the city.
</p>
<p> 
 Yahoo! Japan plan to donate Hands On Search to an organisation at the end of 
 October, though it has not been decided who will receive it. There are 
 currently no plans to make a commercial version of Hands On Search, the 
 company has said.

<h3 id="i162-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: One Million Steps:</h3>
<p>  Boosting Access Awareness, One Website at a Time. By Robin Christopherson
</p>
<p> 
 Recent research shows that the great majority of websites are still failing 
 consistently to comply with even the lowest priority checkpoints of the 
 accessibility guidelines set out by the international web standards body the 
 World Wide Web Consortium. Despite a plethora of initiatives to raise 
 awareness of this issue, from Citizens Online’s ‘Fix the Web’ campaign to 
 Global Accessibility Awareness Day, the situation does not seem to be 
 improving at a significant rate.
</p>
<p> 
 Little wonder, therefore, that one in six of us is still reluctant to 
 venture into the online world and not surprising either that around half of 
 those on the wrong side of the digital divide are disabled, and a similar 
 number are aged 65 or over. The scope for mainstream technologies to 
 transform the lives of this sizeable minority seems largely untapped.
</p>
<p> 
 It is ironic that in this divided digital economy, the UK public sector – 
 both local and central government – is now heavily promoting the elusive 
 ‘channel shift’ – a switch from dealing with citizens by phone, post or 
 face-to-face, to digital channels. This, we are told, is the holy grail of 
 efficient modern public services.
</p>
<p> 
 But the truth is that in this same new digital world, some eight million UK 
 citizens without full access to the online environment due to age, 
 disability or economic situation could become progressively disenfranchised, 
 economically, socially and even politically.
</p>
<p> 
 But there is a glimmer of hope. Just in time, it appears that technology has 
 an emergent property – that of inclusivity. Mainstream devices are actually 
 getting increasingly user-friendly for disabled and older people as design 
 becomes more inclusive for all of us. And prices are dropping too as these 
 products become more ubiquitous.
</p>
<p> 
 In the past, disabled people became accustomed to living in a ‘ghetto’ of 
 specialist, bespoke products with prohibitive price tags that few could 
 afford. But all of that specialist functionality and much, much more can now 
 be supplied for a fraction of the cost by smartphones or tablets, using mass 
 market applications and not expensively produced bespoke software. With the 
 addition of inexpensive peripherals such as Bluetooth keyboards or switching 
 devices, almost anyone’s needs can be served.
</p>
<p> 
 The trick is to know how to make the necessary adjustments in their 
 operating systems and functions to make them more disability friendly and 
 accommodate your own specific requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet’s contribution to solving this problem is “My Computer, My Way”, 
 an online resource to which any website can link for free. It’s already 
 embedded in various high profile sites such as Samsung, Barclays, Sky and 
 NHS Choices, and now the charity has set itself the target of ensuring one 
 million websites are linked to the tool.
</p>
<p> 
 Designed to help those who struggle at the digital interface (with a vision 
 or hearing impairment, difficulties in operating keyboard and mouse; or 
 simply reading and spelling), a link to My Computer My Way from a website’s 
 accessibility page helps to equip users with the information they need to 
 optimise their experience.
</p>
<p> 
 And you don’t have to be disabled to find this tool valuable. Have you tried 
 to use your tablet device in strong sunlight? Wouldn’t it be easier to see 
 what’s on the screen if you knew how to adjust the brightness?
</p>
<p> 
 It explains the accessibility features of many operating systems across a 
 wide range of devices including Mac and PC desktops, tablets and 
 smartphones. It now includes details of current desktop versions of Windows 
 and Mac OS X, as well as newly launched versions of Android and iOS. The 
 next version is due out by Christmas 2013 to explain what’s new in Android 
 4.3 Jellybean and iOS7.
</p>
<p> 
 Not only does this mean that end-users will be able to navigate online 
 content more effectively, it also increases the legal compliance of any site 
 as it shows a real commitment to accessibility and digital inclusion.
</p>
<p> 
 At AbilityNet we believe that communicating simple messages about 
 accessibility is the most effective way to raise awareness and behaviour. It’s 
 a slow process, but an incremental one, and we remain hopeful that 
 significant progress can be made.
</p>
