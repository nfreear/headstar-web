<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: ‘Historic’ Accessible Copyright Treaty Is ‘Miracle Inmarrakech’
</h3>
<p> 
 An historic international treaty to increase book access for
 blind and visually impaired people has finally been adopted at
 a meeting of the World International Property Organisation
 (WIPO) after almost six years of wrangling, negotiations and
 setbacks.
</p>
<p> 
 Signed at a WIPO conference in Marrakech, Morocco, the
 treaty will allow exceptions to copyright laws so accessible
 versions of books and other printed material can be shared
 internationally for blind and visually impaired people to use.
 Up to now, such sharing of books has not been possible due
 to objections from copyright holders in some countries.
</p>
<p> 
 For the treaty to now come into force, 20 countries have to
 ratify it. Once this happens, any country can sign up to the
 treaty by ratifying it, and would then have to abide by its
 terms.
</p>
<p> 
 Dan Pescod, Vice Chair of the World Blind Union – a key
 player in negotiations and the development of the treaty –
 told E-Access Bulletin that during the last day of the WIPO
 Marrakech conference, 51 countries signed the treaty, with a
 signature being “a strong demonstration of intent to ratify the
 treaty”. The UK was one of four EU countries to sign.
</p>
<p> 
 Even during this latest conference, it seemed possible the
 treaty would be deferred once more or watered down, said
 Pescod. He said the eventual successful outcome was such a
 surprise it was dubbed the ‘miracle in Marrakech’ by some
 involved.
</p>
<p> 
 The final treaty contains everything for which the WBU had
 hoped, Pescod said, although one element that remains “less
 clear” is that of commercial availability checks. “[This is] the
 idea that you would only be able to use treaty if you have
 satisfied the question of whether a book is already available
 in an accessible format commercially [in the country you’re
 sending to]. That was excluded from the export part of the
 treaty.”
</p>
<p> 
 However, this caveat only applies to a small number of
 countries – those that have a domestic commercial availability
 clause in their law – and would not necessarily be
 implemented by those countries, he said. The UK does have
 such a law however, and the WBU is now in talks with the
 country’s Intellectual Property Office to discuss the issue.
</p>
<p> 
 Although it represents a crucial victory in the fight for wider
 accessible book access, Pescod said the signing represents the
 beginning of a subsequent, new phase of work. “As much as
 it was an intense and exhausting campaign … we now have a
 new campaign to get countries to ratify the treaty, and with
 that comes the job of explaining to people in simple terms
 what the treaty provisions allow.”
</p>
<p> 
 Alongside this global campaign, the World Blind Union will
 be helping countries and organisations to use the treaty
 effectively and practically, as well as continuing to work with
 publishers and software developers to promote accessible
 publishing. “The treaty is only a means to that end, it’s not
 the end in itself”, Pescod said.
</p>
<p> 
 Pescod estimates that accessible books should start being
 shared across borders by 2015, after the WBU campaigns for
 an initial 20 countries to ratify the treaty (which is necessary
 for it to come into force), which the WBU is hoping to
 achieve by the end of 2014.
</p>
<p> 
 “This is very much a historic and unprecedented thing that
 we’ve done and we’re very proud to have done it,” said
 Pescod, “but we know we’ve still got a lot of work to do to
 ensure that we make a really big dent in this book famine, so
 we’re not going to be resting on our laurels just because
 we’ve got this treaty.”

<h3 id="i160-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Bbc Issues Draft Guidelines For Mobile Accessibility</h3>
<p> 
 A draft set of standards and guidelines to make BBC web
 content and apps more accessible when viewed on mobile
 devices has been released by the corporation following a year
 of testing and development.
</p>
<p> 
 The Draft BBC Mobile Accessibility Standards and
 Guidelines were announced in a blog post by Henny Swan,
 senior accessibility specialist at the BBC. Up to now the
 BBC’s existing accessibility guidelines have been used as a
 basis for creating accessible mobile content, Swan says, but it
 was felt that more specific mobile standards were now
 needed.
</p>
<p> 
 “We have our BBC Accessibility Standards and Guidelines
 in-house, [but] these were produced in 2005 when mobile was
 not as dominant as it is now”, Swan told E-Access Bulletin.
 “They are also geared towards HTML and don’t speak to
 designers and developers working on native apps. The same
 goes for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 [WCAG]… While much of it is suited to the mobile web it
 didn’t fit what we needed exactly and wasn’t something that
 native app developers or designers identified with.”
</p>
<p> 
 Three sets of standards and guidelines were initially
 developed by the BBC, for HTML, iOS, and Android – the
 three most common platforms used to access mobile content,
 and also those that have “the most mature accessibility
 support”, writes Swan in her blog post. These three sets were
 then merged to create an overall document, covering
 accessibility in a wide range of areas including: editorial;
 images; design; structure; navigation; notifications, and links.
 For each, there are examples of how to implement each
 requirement or recommendation on all three platforms for
 testing.
</p>
<p> 
 “The plan [now] is to write techniques for additional
 platforms as and when the need arises,” writes Swan on the
 blog, “but this doesn’t stop our teams applying these
 standards and guidelines for Windows Phone, Blackberry
 and other platforms in the meantime.”
</p>
<p> 
 Although the guidelines were developed for accessing BBC
 content on mobile devices, Swan said she hopes other
 organisations will be able to benefit from them. Feedback
 from all is invited, with plans to make a final version available
 in due course.

<p> 
 Banking and financial services company Barclays is among
 winners of the Technology4Good Awards 2013, an annual
 event which celebrates the potential of technology to affect
 social change.
</p>
<p> 
 The award recognises Barclays’ use of technology in making
 its services more accessible to people with disabilities and
 impairments. This includes adapting more than 3,500 of its
 ATMs (automated teller machines, or cashpoints) – 84% of
 the bank’s network – so that they can be used with
 earphones, allowing people with impaired vision, dyslexia or
 other reading problems to listen to the on-screen options.
</p>
<p> 
 A range of brightly coloured ‘hi-vis’ debit cards, some with
 guidance arrows, have also been introduced by Barclays, to
 help visually impaired customers find the card easily and see
 which side needs to be inserted into an ATM or card reader.
</p>
<p> 
 Other winners of the Technology4Good Awards – organised
 by technology access charity AbilityNet – include user-led
 mental health charity Self Help Services, which provides
 services in the north of England, including computerised
 cognitive behavioural therapy services. After an initial in-
 person assessment, clients have access to a range of e-learning
 resources and other digital material.
</p>
<p> 
 The Local Digital Champion Award was won by Norman
 Hunter, who has worked with digital inclusion charity Go
 ON UK to help people gain basic IT skills.

Section Two: Special Report
- The story behind the BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Going Mobileby Henny Swan.
</h3>
<p> 
 The BBC has now published a set of draft Mobile
 Accessibility Standards and Guidelines to the wider web
 development community, a ground-breaking project which
 has been in development for a year now [see also – news,
 earlier in this issue of E-Access Bulletin]. While written
 primarily for BBC employees and suppliers to use, the
 corporation’s hope is that they might be useful for any
 individual or organisation building mobile web content and
 native apps.
</p>
<p> 
 For years, BBC teams have used the BBC Accessibility
 Guidelines to help them build accessible websites (
 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/</a>
 ). These have also proved a useful foundation for our work on
 mobile accessibility, but we felt we needed something more
 targeted for mobile and responsive websites and, of course,
 native applications. Furthermore the BBC Accessibility
 Guidelines were produced in 2005 when mobile was not as
 dominant as it is now. They are also geared towards HTML
 and don’t speak to designers and developers working on
 native apps.
</p>
<p> 
 The same goes for the widely-used Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) published by the
 international Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide
 Web Consortium: while much of the WCAG content is suited
 to the mobile web, and forms the foundation of the BBC
 guidelines, it didn’t fit what we needed exactly and wasn’t
 something that native app developers or designers identified
 with.
</p>
<p> 
 Moreover, while various platforms such as Blackberry,
 Windows Mobile, Nokia, Android and Apple have their own
 guidelines for accessibility, they tend to focus only on the
 capabilities of that particular platform. So, for example, where
 Apple iOS may have an in-depth focus on technical
 accessibility for its built-in screen-reader, VoiceOver, their
 guidance may not focus as much on visual accessibility. This
 means some platform accessibility guidelines are less
 complete than others or might contain some really useful
 advice that could work across all platforms. In addition to
 this, some advice and techniques relating to accessibility are
 not highlighted as ‘accessibility’ and are buried deep within
 the documentation that companies publish for developers.
</p>
<p> 
 Asking teams to deliver accessible and usable content against
 this fragmented and unequal backdrop is unrealistic. We had
 to provide a single resource that was tangible and testable to
 follow rather than ask teams to follow various different sets
 of guidance.
</p>
<p> 
 From a project management perspective, where a single
 product might be available as a responsive site, an iOS app
 and an Android app, it made sense therefore to develop
 technology-agnostic standards and guidelines with
 technology specific techniques. Teams working on deploying
 the same content across devices and platforms therefore work
 towards a common framework of accessibility support (as far
 as the platform allows), which in turn helps us maintain a
 level of consistency across devices.
</p>
<p> 
 What we aim to do is not simply make content consistently
 accessible but to also make it a familiar and enjoyable user
 experience, whether you are looking at BBC content on your
 desktop or within an app. What we want to avoid are
 situations such as the following, described by Leonie Watson,
 a screen-reader user: “You download a new app, you start
 using it and it looks really good, and feels really good, then
 something frays a bit around the edges and then you’re like,
 ‘Ugh, here we go again!’ You kind of lose a bit of confidence
 in it.”
</p>
<p> 
 There are other new opportunities, too. Thinking beyond the
 technicalities of making content accessible, there are huge
 opportunities to create apps that help disabled users access
 what’s happening around them. We see this already with apps
 which allow blind users to tag and then “geolocate” shops, so
 when they walk down a street they know where they are. Or
 apps where people can tag music or TV shows. As a
 broadcaster, using mobile devices as companions to TV opens
 up the opportunity to merge broadcast and web content in
 new ways, to provide access to information about TV content
 that is topical, live and highly accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 How and where we view TV, listen to radio and consume the
 news is changing. These are all key mediums for any of us to
 remain connected. Mobile accessibility is therefore vital to
 ensure no-one is left behind.
