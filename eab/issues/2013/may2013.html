<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: International Web Access Guidelines “Ineffective”,Academic Claims
</h3>
<p> 
 Conforming to the international industry standard Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) can be “ineffective” as a method
 of reducing problems encountered by blind and visually impaired
 web users, one IT academic has claimed.
</p>
<p> 
 The WCAG guidelines are created by the international World
 Wide Web Consortium, which oversees web standards. In his
 PhD thesis for the University of York, ‘Disabled people and the
 Web: User-based measurement of accessibility’, André Pimenta
 Freire – a specialist in human-computer interaction – writes that
 a large number of problems on website pages encountered by
 print-disabled computer users would not have been resolved by
 conformance to WCAG criteria.
</p>
<p> 
 “Achieving certain conformance levels with WCAG 1.0 and WCAG
 2.0 can be very ineffective as a means to reduce the numbers of
 problems encountered by disabled users”, writes Freire. “The
 way the conformance requirements are structured do not seem
 to address the all-important concern of making websites that
 disabled users can use better and encountering fewer
 problems.”
</p>
<p> 
 The claims are based on a study carried out as part of his thesis,
 which involved task-based user evaluations of 16 websites from
 64 users. Of these, 32 users were blind, 19 partially sighted and
 13 dyslexic. Manual audits were used to determine website
 conformance to WCAG 1.0 and 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 The two primary aims of the study were to characterise the
 problems that print-disabled computer users encounter through
 websites, and to investigate the relationship between user-
 defined accessibility issues and accessibility guidelines, with a
 focus on WCAG. 1.0 and 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 The study demonstrated that conforming to the checkpoints and
 success criteria of WCAG does not necessarily, by itself, make a
 website accessible to print-disabled users, says Freire.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin, Helen Petrie, Professor of Human
 Computer Interaction at the University of York and co-supervisor
 for Freire’s PhD and the senior academic who led the research
 for Freire’s thesis, said that although WCAG has made “a great
 effort” and highlighted important problems, websites with
 higher conformance to the guidelines are not easier to use for
 blind users. “There is no significant difference in the number of
 user problems on non-conformant sites and on conformant
 sites”, Petrie said.
</p>
<p> 
 This has problematic implications if legislation or policy about web
 accessibility were to be formed and based on WCAG
 conformance, said Petrie. A further problem is that “developers
 are struggling to understand [WCAG]”, Petrie said, meaning that
 direct user-testing with disabled users should be encouraged as a
 means of testing accessibility, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Both Petrie and Freire stress the importance of involving disabled
 users directly in the design and evaluation process of building
 websites, and of moving away from “the technical conformance
 approach” of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 “The conclusions reinforced the importance of involving disabled
 users in the design and evaluation of websites as a key activity to
 improve web accessibility … The current status quo of proposing
 implementations based on expert opinion, or limited user
 studies, has not yielded solutions to many of the current
 problems print-disabled users encounter on the web”, writes
 Freire.

<h3 id="i158-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: First Council Elections For Accessible Ict Coalition</h3>
<p> 
 The OneVoice for Accessible ICT Coalition has elected its first
 formal controlling council, as it works towards its goal of
 becoming lead facilitator for the digital inclusion and accessible
 ICT sectors in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 Nigel Lewis, chief executive officer of technology access charity
 AbilityNet and chair of OneVoice, told E-Access Bulletin that the
 group aims to become a hub through which organisations from all
 sectors can share information and best practice on inclusive ICT.
</p>
<p> 
 “One of the key roles OneVoice will play is to be a facilitator
 between all of the organisations and other groups working in the
 digital inclusion space”, Lewis said. “We can help join people and
 groups together … I think there’s a real need for that, because
 there are too many people doing great stuff in isolation.”
</p>
<p> 
 As well as engaging with digital inclusion groups, businesses,
 government and other organisations, the long-term goals of
 OneVoice will include helping to embed inclusion in the training
 of IT professionals, and assisting organisations in delivering
 inclusive systems, Lewis said.
</p>
<p> 
 Following elections at the coalition’s first AGM in May, OneVoice
 has a council of seven members: Nigel Lewis; Graeme Whippy of
 Lloyds TSB IT Accessibility Group; John Lamb of Ability Magazine;
 Peter Abrahams of Bloor Research; Fiona Miller of BT, Ian Lyons
 of Shaw Trust, and Howard Lester, an independent disability
 consultant.
</p>
<p> 
 OneVoice is now looking to secure funding to help pursue its
 goals. At the recent AGM it was agreed that a fee structure for
 membership will be introduced, and OneVoice will also be
 looking for seeded project funding as well.
</p>
<p> 
 Current members include BT, AbilityNet, the Business Disability
 Forum, disability campaigning network RADAR, technology
 industry body Intellect, inclusive technology advisory service JISC
 TechDis, and Lloyds Banking Group.
</p>
<p> 
 The recent AGM and council elections signalled a “seminal
 moment” for OneVoice, said Lewis. “We’ve done a lot through
 the current members and their goodwill and time, and I think this
 is the moment we can make a real step change. There seems to
 be a definite will to make that happen as I talk to more and more
 people – current members and potential members as well. This
 year should see a real change for OneVoice.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Disability Still A Major Factor In Determining Uk Internetuse, Report Finds
</h3>
<p> 
 UK adults with a disability are still three times less likely to have
 used the internet than those without a disability, a report from
 the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown.
</p>
<p> 
 The figures in the latest Internet Access Quarterly Update,
 released every four months, show that at the first quarter of
 2013, there were 3.7 million disabled adults – as defined by the
 Disability Discrimination Act – who had never used the internet,
 representing 32% of all adults in the UK with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The total amount of adults who had never used the internet at
 the first quarter of 2013 was 7.1 million (14%), meaning that more
 than half (53%) of this figure were people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 However there are fewer adults with a disability offline than
 were shown in the ONS update for the previous quarter, which
 reported 3.8 million adults with a disability never having gone
 online. In fact, with several brief exceptions, this figure has been
 falling regularly since the ONS began publishing its Internet
 Access Quarterly Updates at the beginning of 2011, and the
 figure of 3.7 million in the latest update is the lowest yet.
</p>
<p> 
 Age is another key factor in determining internet use, the report
 shows. Only 34% (1.6 million people) of adults over 75 had used
 the internet, meaning that the 3.1 million people aged 75 and
 over who had not gone online made up 43% of the total of 7.1
 million non-user adults.
</p>
<p> 
 The figures in the Internet Access Quarterly Update are derived
 from the ONS Labour Force Survey, a continuous household
 survey of employment circumstances of the UK population
 conducted in England, Scotland and Wales. The latest version of
 the update can be viewed below:

<p>  Thomas “Boots” Anderson, a 78-year-old former RAF Mountain and Desert Rescue Team volunteer member,
 writes in to tell us about a story of derring-do following our
 coverage last issue of the blind adventurer Erik Weihenmayer.
</p>
<p> 
 “I read the story about Erik Weihenmayer with great interest”,
 Thomas writes. “This month I met Steve Bate, a young Kiwi [New
 Zealander] who lives in Moray and has a similar type of sight-
 destroying disease as Erik.
</p>
<p> 
 “Steve is raising funds for North East Sensory Services by tackling
 “El Capitan”, SOLO (!), in Yosemite National Park, US – before he
 loses his sight.”
</p>
<p> 
 Further details of Steve Bate’s expedition can be found online. El
 Capitan is a 3,000 foot high vertical rock formation, a tough
 challenge indeed, and North East Sensory Services is an
 Aberdeen-based charity providing emotional and practical
 support to people in the Northeast of England affected by a sight
 or hearing loss.
</p>
<p> 
 As Bate’s expedition page on Facebook explains: “Now I have
 the chance to prove to myself that big dreams can come true if
 we work hard enough. A year in the planning and training to try
 and prepare myself for the biggest challenge I have ever faced, a
 3,000ft rock face solo. The scariest thing is to commit to try
 something so extreme and make it public, now after a year all
 that's left is to climb it!”

Section Three: Special Report
- Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: A Worldwide Audience For Web Accessibilityby Tristan Parker
</h3>
<p> 
 This year, 9 May recently marked the second Global Accessibility
 Awareness Day (GAAD), an event that aims to encourage web
 developers and related communities to think about accessibility
 for disabled computer users when designing and building web
 pages.
</p>
<p> 
 GAAD was inspired by a blog post in which US-based developer
 Joe Devon called for widespread accessible web design. The post
 was noticed by accessibility professional Jennison Asuncion, and
 the two began working to raise the profile of digital accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Individuals and organisations from across the globe create and
 take part in awareness-raising activities during GAAD, from
 holding talks to tweeting accessibility messages to using only part
 of a computer to simulate the barriers faced by someone with an
 impairment or disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Here, Devon and Asuncion speak to E-Access Bulletin about the
 aims of GAAD and the 2013 event.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Please tell us about the background to Global Accessibility
 Awareness Day.
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: I had seen this video by Victor Tsaran, a blind accessibility
 programmer working for Yahoo! He was demonstrating what it
 was like to surf the internet using a screen reader [video here:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izrC4R7SsH4 ].
</p>
<p> 
 He was surfing the Yahoo! site with links all over the place. I was
 fascinated by how quickly the screen-reader navigated through
 the content. And it got me thinking about how important it was
 that markup [a type of computer language] be done
 semantically.
</p>
<p> 
 Fast forward five years, I was watching my father struggle with a
 banking website. He was 86 at the time, with severe hearing
 impairment and reduced visual acuity. It was terrible the struggle
 he faced when calling the bank and trying to navigate their
 voicemail system.
</p>
<p> 
 You would think that moving banking activity online would help
 things out. But it didn’t. Responding to an email from the bank
 once resulted in him getting phished. So you can’t trust that. It’s
 great that the bank has direct messages. He wrote a message
 with an issue once, and then he got an email telling him there
 was a response on the website. But he didn’t know if that was
 true.
</p>
<p> 
 I watched him go to the website and realised that although there
 was an alert that he had a message, it was so subtle there was no
 way he would notice it. Had the bank done user-testing with the
 elderly, they would have known this. The situation got me mad.
 And inspired me to write a blog post suggesting a Global
 Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) for web development
 professionals.
</p>
<p> 
 I thought it would be ignored, like all my other blog posts.
 However, Jennison Asuncion, a digital accessibility professional in
 Toronto (I was living in Los Angeles), stumbled upon it on Twitter
 and told me we had to make it happen. And so GAAD was born.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Who are the main team behind GAAD and how did those
 people become involved?
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: Well, I suppose Jennison and I are volunteers for life. But so
 many people have been pitching in that it would be hard to even
 tell you who is “the team”. Informally there seems to be a tight-
 knit community and they are all in with us.
</p>
<p> 
 Jennison: It was really amazing to see folks step up. Whether it
 was volunteering to translate text into different languages,
 people tweeting, writing and blogging to promote the day,
 others organising events at their companies/organisations, many
 have much to be proud of.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Do you think GAAD 2013 was the biggest yet?
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: GAAD 2013 was only our second year. GAAD 2012 blew us
 away. We never expected such a response. We thought it would
 take a much bigger effort to take off, but I guess we touched a
 nerve. Now GAAD 2013 was so beyond expectation, that yes, it
 was the biggest so far.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: What preparation took place for this year’s event?
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: My father got cancer in November 2012 and passed away
 mid-February. So I was pretty out of it for this year’s
 preparations. But basically Jennison worked social media and his
 personal network, and people contacted us. Jennison directed
 changes to the website and Facebook almost daily. Web
 developer Mindy Morgan (with Diamond Web Services) was
 extremely helpful throughout this procedure and she made the
 changes. Not to mention designed a killer logo and redid my
 awful website layout from the year before. Finally, L.A.-based
 accessibility specialist Joseph O’Connor made sure our event’s
 site was accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Although it’s very much a widespread event with people
 undertaking their own projects, from a personal perspective,
 how was GAAD 2013?
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: I just couldn’t believe my eyes. I did a representative count
 of tweets on the GAAD hashtag and it was about a tweet a
 minute. I’m far from having seen all the tweets. I did notice that
 the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] tweeted
 accessibility all day to celebrate the event. We had many
 corporations do internal events. From Facebook to Intuit [a
 United States-based financial software company] to PayPal to
 coverage on .Net’s online magazine, with Mindy’s logo on the
 cover, it was overwhelming. I still can’t believe what grew out of
 a simple blog post.
</p>
<p> 
 Jennison: Echoing Joe, I was taken aback at how much interest
 GAAD had. In addition to the number of events held for the
 public and at schools/companies/organisations around the world,
 for me, it was hearing from the folks from the National
 Association of the Physical Disabled - Nepal who held an
 awareness session with the local IT community and the
 Independent Living Resource Centre in St. John’s, Canada, that
 were particularly thrilling. I encourage readers to go to
 www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org to see what went on,
 it was truly amazing.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Have there been any projects or results that have already
 arisen as a result of GAAD 2013?
</p>
<p> 
 Joe: Jennison and I are working on starting a foundation and a
 book to further the goals of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.
 Specifically, to make web development professionals and others
 in the high-tech industry aware of digital accessibility. You would
 be amazed how few even know what a screen-reader is and
