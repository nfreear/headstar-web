<h3 id="i156-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Tech Giant Launches Smartphone For Older People</h3>
<p> 
 A smartphone designed for elderly people has been developed
 by global technology company Fujitsu.
</p>
<p> 
 When setting up the Stylistic S01 phone the user inputs their
 age, which customises some aspects to work differently. For
 example, the audio frequency range will be optimised for older
 people so they can clearly hear the voice of the person they are
 speaking to, and the phone can also slow down the speech of a
 caller without losing audio quality, again making it easier to
 understand.
</p>
<p> 
 The Stylistic also features a forgiving touch-screen which
 highlights icons if they are only touched lightly. This means
 that accidental touches – common by people not familiar with
 smartphone controls – will not immediately lead to an
 undesired function.
</p>
<p> 
 Each sub-screen on the phone also contains a question mark
 icon which gives the user
 guidance for that page.
</p>
<p> 
 “People are living longer, have access to better healthcare and
 want to have access to the same communications channels
 (email, social media) that their younger family does.” James
 Maynard, product marketing director at Fujitsu, told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The Stylistic S01 phone will be released in France in June. The
 cost has not been confirmed, but it will be priced as a “mid-
 range handset”, Maynard said. The phone’s release in other
 countries is under discussion between Fujitsu and
 telecommunications partner Orange.
</p>
<p> 
 Fujitsu also recently unveiled another technological innovation
 designed to assist elderly people, the ‘New Generation Cane’.
 This is a prototype of a walking stick with built-in GPS and
 heart-rate monitor, which could send the user’s location and
 health data to a cloud network. Data could then be sent back to
 the cane to help direct the user. Family members can also
 check the heart rate of an elderly relative using the cane via the
 cloud, to check that they are not encountering difficulties.
 There is currently no indication of if and when the cane might
 become a purchasable product, however.

<h3 id="i156-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Uk Government Funding For Assistive App “Georgie”</h3>
<p> 
 Up to 200 blind and visually impaired people are to be trained
 to use a package of smartphone apps that can help with
 communication and everyday tasks, with &pound;14,000 of funding
 allocated by the UK government.
</p>
<p> 
 The training is for an app bundle for Android smartphones
 named “Georgie”, developed by husband and wife Roger and
 Margaret Wilson-Hinds through their company
 Screenreader.net. The apps help blind and visually impaired
 people operate smartphones using functions such as voice-
 assisted touch-screen operation, and also help people with
 daily tasks such as catching public transport, reading printed
 text aloud and navigation outdoors (see also our previous
 report on the apps – full link:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=751">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=751</a>
 Short link: <a href="http://bit.ly/X8zS7I">http://bit.ly/X8zS7I</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The free training sessions will be available at 30 locations
 across the UK with funding from the Department for Work and
 Pensions (DWP) provided to the charity Communication for
 Blind People, the parent organisation of Screenreader.net. As
 well as funding the trainers’ time, the money will help buy
 phones and develop learning resources including Braille and
 large print manuals, Tim Carrington, Screenreader.net’s
 business development manager, told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The app training programme is part of a three million pound
 government funding project entitled Strengthening Disabled
 People’s User Led Organisations, launched in July 2011.
</p>
<p> 
 “A training session will enable a hesitant smartphone user to
 learn how Georgie can provide them with the confidence to
 better venture out into the world”, Carrington told E-Access
 Bulletin. “Trainers will provide hands-on use of Georgie to
 Blind Association staff who will go on to act as local learning
 champions, to support Georgie users and direct them to web
 pages and other learning resources once the trainer has left.”
</p>
<p> 
 Local maps and data will also be integrated into the sessions,
 Carrington said. For example, one of Georgie’s features is a
 bus app, and this will use local information to help users find
 their nearest bus stop, see bus times and find out when to get
 off at the right stop.
</p>
<p> 
 Sessions will begin in May, and blind and visually impaired
 people can find out more by emailing:

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Web Content Accessibility Checker Pitched At Wideraudience
</h3>
<p> 
 An updated version of a free web content accessibility
 checker, originally developed because its creator was frustrated
 at the limitations of similar products, has been launched in
 JavaScript to allow wider usage.
</p>
<p> 
 QUAIL ( <a href="http://quailjs.org/">http://quailjs.org/</a>
 ) is a piece of software that uses more than 200 tests to assess if web content conforms to the
 widely used Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 Kevin Miller, a web developer at California State University,
 Monterey Bay, developed the first version in 2009 after he
 found other accessibility checkers that he used in his job too
 limited. “I wrote QUAIL out of frustration about what products
 were out there at the time,” Miller told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Issues for which QUAIL can test include seeing if headers on
 web pages are being used correctly; if links to other pages
 make sense when read on their own – perhaps by a screen-
 reader; and if images have appropriate text to describe them for
 someone who cannot see the image. It can be used to provide
 accessibility checking for any web page, including learning
 management systems, social media sites or content
 management systems.
</p>
<p> 
 The software is aimed primarily at developers and content
 authors. “Ultimately, the goal was to provide instant feedback
 to content creators, kind of like spell-check-as-you-type lets
 users know they misspelled a word with a red underline,
 QUAIL can do the same about images missing a description …
 When a document is easier to read for everyone, it’s also a big
 win for users with assistive technology” Miller said.
</p>
<p> 
 QUAIL has now been converted from PHP (a programming
 language commonly used in web developing) to a jQuery
 plugin – software that uses the widely used JavaScript
 programming language – to open it up to more users. “I really
 wanted this to be a project that could be embraced regardless
 of what someone was building”, Miller said. “Because
 JavaScript is ‘the programming language of the web’, moving
 to JavaScript meant a much broader potential audience.”
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking about how he would like to develop the software in
 the future, Miller said that QUAIL can help make accessibility
 testing a more automated and integrated experience, by
 registering and testing every change made when a web
 application is being built, for example.

<p>  Australian accessibility academic and consultant Tom Worthington, a regular contributor to the
 bulletin (see News in Brief, this issue), writes in to point
 readers to a response he has posted on his “Net Traveller” blog
 to a story in our last issue on the release of some new Smart
 Home Accessibility Guidelines by John Gill Technology (E-

 ).</p>
<p> 
 “These recommendations suggest that ICT in the home can
 help the elderly and others with disabilities, but only if their
 needs are taken into consideration when designing the
 interfaces for the smart home”, Tom says. “I suggest that voice
 and other hands-free controls would be useful for the
 population generally, as well as those with a disability. Also
 designers of smart home controls and displays tend to make
 them too complex and hard to use, and so an accessible design
 would benefit everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 “However, I question the value of controls and displays for
 smart homes. A truly smart home should anticipate needs and
 adjust, without having any explicit input from the occupants
 and any need for them to look at displays.
</p>
<p> 
 “Smart meters are an example of what is not a ‘smart’
 technology. Householders should not have to read the tariff
 from a meter and then manually adjust the appliances in their
 home: this should happen automatically. Smarter technology
 has existed for decades with off-peak electric hot water
 systems, which switch on automatically when tariffs are low.
 An electronic smart meter should be able to be interfaced to
 major energy using appliances, which also monitor the pattern
 of use and so can optimise energy saving without bothering the
 householder.”

Section Three: Profile
- Neil Cottrell, Founder, LexAble

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: How To Spell Innovationby Tristan Parker
</h3>
<p> 
 After being diagnosed with dyslexia as a child, Neil Cottrell
 used various forms of assistive technology to help him study.
 He went on to develop his own autocorrective software, Global
 AutoCorrect, forming the company LexAble to develop and
 market it. Global AutoCorrect has now sold about 10,000
 copies. E-Access Bulletin spoke to Cottrell about how his own
 innovations helped him achieve a first-class degree at
 university and start his own business.
</p>
<p> 
 E-Access Bulletin: How did it all begin?
</p>
<p> 
 Neil Cottrell: I was identified as being dyslexic when I was
 about 10 or 11-years-old. I was a very bright kid but my
 dyslexia was really quite severe, so it meant that I was really
 good at some things and really bad at others.
</p>
<p> 
 I ended up using lot of technology through school and
 university. My Local Education Authority bought me a laptop
 with a couple of assistive technology (AT) programs on, which
 I used in all of my lessons. My computer would read
 everything aloud to me, and I was using it to help organise my
 ideas. So I grew up benefiting from technology from a young
 age.
</p>
<p> 
 Then when I got to 15, I started doing my GCSEs. Once I’d
 written something I could read it back with text-to-speech and
 spell check and all those things, but where I still had a problem
 that the AT wasn’t solving was with the process of writing.
</p>
<p> 
 I’d start writing a sentence and get to a word I didn’t know how
 to spell, then the red underline would pop up from the spell
 check and when that happened, what I’d do – which was a
 really bad strategy – was stop mid-sentence and go back and
 work out how to spell that word. I’d lose track of the sentence,
 because I was constantly switching between the processes of
 writing and checking. What I often ended up with were
 sentences that were disjointed and didn’t make practical sense.
</p>
<p> 
 So I started developing a tool for myself which would
 automatically correct my spelling as I was writing. Whether I
 was writing in Microsoft Word or doing a PowerPoint
 presentation or using Facebook, I could have this tool that
 would sit in the background. It really helped because it meant I
 wasn’t worrying about how I was spelling a word when I typed,
 I could just get my ideas down and not have to go back and
 correct things later on.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: How did you learn to build this tool?
</p>
<p> 
 NC: Basically using the internet and online tutorials. Initially, I
 hadn’t envisaged this being something that thousands of people
 would use, it was just a case of, “I’ve got this problem, so it’s
 worth investing a few hours to do something that’s going to
 make everything a lot easier.” I enjoy writing software and in
 order to get it working pretty crudely it was quite quick, but
 then I was making a lot of improvements and building it up to
 work better. I got really into it and saw the benefits.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Did the tool help you with your studies at university?
</p>
<p> 
 NC: Yes, I had a very basic version I could use and then it was
 just adding improvements as I went through school and
 university. My degree was an essay-writing subject,
 Psychology, so I had to write projects and other things. I did
 very well actually, I graduated with the top mark in my year in
 Psychology at Cardiff University and I also got the top mark
 for an essay in my year out of everyone who took Psychology,
 so it showed me that once I had overcome those barriers, I was
 quite good at the fundamentals of writing essays – coming up
 with ideas, forming arguments, putting it together logically. It
 was just the spelling and my thought process getting disturbed
 that was causing problems.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: How did LexAble and Global AutoCorrect take shape?
</p>
<p> 
 NC: I set up LexAble as soon as I graduated and built a
 commercial version of the tool, which became Global
 AutoCorrect. Then I started to show people Global
 AutoCorrect, asking companies if their clients would benefit
 from the software.
</p>
<p> 
 That lasted a couple of years, then it got to the point where, as
 LexAble developed, I would call people up and ask if they
 wanted to know more about the software, and they would say
 ‘Oh yes, I’ve already heard about it, my colleague
 recommended it.’ So, we hit critical mass when we realised that
 people were becoming aware of it. And at that point, things just
 really exploded.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: You went on to win the ‘Accessibility’ category at the
 Technology4Good Awards…
</p>
<p> 
 NC: That was really useful for us, partly as a validation that
 what we were doing was a really good thing, but it also
 introduced us to some corporate clients. Some of the people we
 met at the awards are now helping us to distribute Global
 AutoCorrect across large companies.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Do you think people with dyslexia and other print
 impairments might struggle with computer-based tasks but not
 know how they can go about overcoming those difficulties?
</p>
<p> 
 NC: Yes, I’m sure they do. If you have the correct, easy-to-use
 assistive technology on a computer, it can actually circumvent
 a lot of the problems that you have.
</p>
<p> 
 When you’ve invested time and perhaps when you’ve got
 some support with using a computer and technology, then
 actually, using a computer can make your life so much easier
 and more fulfilling.
</p>
<p> 
 Using a computer is quite a stressful, new thing, and you’ve got
 to learn skills in order to start using it. For some people that can
 cause a lot of anxiety and stress. The same goes for pieces of
 software. There are a lot of things out there that can help
 people, but you’ve got to find out what suits your working
 style and how to use the piece of kit. Once you’ve got over
 those initial barriers to using computers and AT, the benefits
 they can give in terms of productivity and reducing stress are
 absolutely massive.
