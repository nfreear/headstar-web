<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Digital Inclusion “About Everybody, Not Just Disabledpeople”.
</h3>
<p> 
 The concept of digital accessibility simply as a means of
 catering for disabled users is out-of-date: in the modern world,
 digital inclusion must be understood as the need to serve
 everybody, whatever their access method or device, a leading
 accessibility specialist has said.
</p>
<p> 
 Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at technology
 access charity AbilityNet, told delegates at the recent national
 digital conference in London, ND13, that providers of digital
 content and services already need to adapt to new devices and
 access methods. With more people than ever accessing
 websites through mobile and other devices, we are in a
 situation where “everybody is disabled from time-to-time”,
 Christopherson said.
</p>
<p> 
 “People are accessing your content and your services while
 they’re on the go – from a small screen which might be more
 difficult to see, or while they’re driving they might need to
 have things spoken back to them and need to control things by
 voice,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 “This idea of accessibility being for disabled people, I would
 argue, is now anachronistic”, he said. “Digital inclusion is… by
 far a preferred statement, because it talks about including
 everybody, whereas traditionally, accessibility has been this
 bolt-on activity to help disabled people, with additional budget,
 additional skills required.”
</p>
<p> 
 For people with disabilities, new technologies are also opening
 up new horizons, Christopherson said. Emerging technologies
 such as: Google Glass, a head-mountable computer that
 responds to voice commands; software that detects human
 facial expressions; and the ‘Talking Goggles’ app, which
 photographs an object and then tells the user what the object is,
 are all opening up new frontiers of communication.

<h3 id="i159-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Practitioners Rally To Defend Web Access Guidelines.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility practitioners have defended the international
 standard ‘WCAG’ web content accessibility guidelines this
 month, in the wake of an academic study suggesting they were
 “ineffective”.
</p>
<p> 
 The PhD study by André Pimenta Freire of the University of
 York, as reported in E-Access Bulletin in May, said adherence
 to the WCAG guidelines could not resolve many problems on
 website pages encountered by print-disabled computer users. In
 a series of responses on the bulletin’s website, however,
 several practitioners raised objections to points raised in
 Pimenta Freire’s study.
</p>
<p> 
 Ian Hamilton, a user experience consultant who has also
 contributed this issue’s feature on accessible gaming, said the
 study referred to issues such as confusing web page layouts,
 which were problems for all users – not just those with
 disabilities. “These are not accessibility issues, and are not
 what WCAG is for”, Hamilton said. “WCAG is to help avoid
 being unnecessarily excluded because of disability, and not to
 guarantee that people with disabilities can use a website.”
</p>
<p> 
 While he said he agreed with the study’s assertion that user
 testing by people with disabilities is essential to check
 accessibility – and that guidelines should not be relied on alone
 – he said extensive testing at all stages of a design process
 would be too expensive and difficult for most organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 “Testing, guidelines and expert review each have their own
 major inadequacies, and their own major benefits. Do all three
 and they compensate for each other very nicely.”
</p>
<p> 
 In a further analysis, Grant Broome of DIG Inclusion said he
 and his colleagues were concerned that someone reading
 Pimenta Freire’s report might end up rejecting the WCAG
 guidelines, when they are in fact a valuable tool.
</p>
<p> 
 “Many of us who use the guidelines in the real world know
 how essential they are in educating web developers, unifying
 objectives for browser and assistive technology developers,
 and as a tool for measuring accessibility conformance metrics,”
 said Broome.
</p>
<p> 
 “As supporters of user-testing with disabled users, we would
 not promote WCAG as a be-all and end-all solution for
 accessibility: there are perhaps some improvements required to
 be made to the guidelines… however, we would not advocate
 building a web product without a framework which includes
 the support of a robust and recognised set of guidelines such as
 WCAG 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 “Approaching the development or testing of web products
 without this framework and instead relying solely on feedback
 from users is likely to result in an inconsistent and unreliable
 approach to developing a site which is not based on
 measurable metrics, but on individual opinion or preference.”
</p>
<p> 
 Broome said the study’s finding that there was no significant
 difference in the number of user problems found on sites that
 did not conform to the guidelines, compared with those that
 did, was “troubling”, and “it is difficult for us to imagine how a
 study of this depth could arrive at such an impossible
 conclusion.” He said some of the problems found with non-
 conforming websites in the study – such as broken links – are
 in fact covered in the guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 The University of York Computer Science Department said this
 week it was confident
 the results in the study were derived from rigorous scientific
 and mathematical analysis of the data gathered. Further
 detailed comment from the department has been invited by E-
 Access bulletin for our next issue.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Employers ‘Need Support To Make Job Applicationsaccessible’.
</h3>
<p> 
 Employers need more support to make their digital job
 application processes accessible to people with disabilities,
 according to a new report from disability employment services
 charity Shaw Trust.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, ‘Making work a real choice’, examines the
 government’s disability employment programme Work Choice
 through the experiences of more than 400 people – a mix of
 job applicants, employers, and Shaw Trust staff.
</p>
<p> 
 Employers’ online application forms acted as a barrier for
 some disabled applicants, as the process was not always
 accessible, the report finds. For example, ‘time-out’ features on
 some online forms, which force applicants to enter information
 within a time limit, were particularly problematic for some
 people with learning difficulties.
</p>
<p> 
 “One customer outlined how their learning difficulty prevented
 them from completing a screen of an online application form
 for a national company in the required time limit”, it states.
 “The failure to complete the task resulted in the customer being
 barred for reapplying for another job with the employer for
 two years.”
</p>
<p> 
 To help solve this and other related problems, the report
 recommends that employers should receive support to make
 their recruitment processes fully accessible. Although some
 government funding is already available for staff with
 disabilities through Access to Work, a scheme that offers
 funding for costs such as assistive equipment, this is focused
 on helping people once they have secured work, the Shaw
 Trust report says. “There is therefore a lack of subsidised
 support for employers to help make their application processes
 fully accessible. Increasing the accessibility of the application
 stage, could remove another systemic barrier to more people
 with disabilities entering work”, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin Ian Lyons, sales manager for
 digital inclusion at Shaw Trust, said that although many
 organisations are happy to fix digital accessibility problems
 once they have been pointed out, most do not have the in-
 house skills to consider accessibility from the outset. “In the
 life-cycle of the employment process, from when a candidate
 is looking for work to their first day [of employment] people
 forget how much of that process is actually digital. I think most
 organisations want to make employment a level playing field
 for everyone, but a lot of them don’t know where to go to get
 that support or to implement those processes.”

Section Two: Special Report
- Accessible Video Games.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b> By Ian Hamilton.
</h3>
<p> 
 Video games are now a major part of our culture, but one in
 which accessibility for people with disabilities is comparatively
 low. Work in this field has been accelerating greatly in the past
 couple of years, however, making it a very exciting and fast-
 paced area of accessibility to be involved with.
</p>
<p> 
 Major players include the charities SpecialEffect and
 AbleGamers Foundation, and the International Game
 Developers Association’s game accessibility special interest
 group, alongside many other smaller groups and individuals
 working on advocacy and development in industry and
 academia.
</p>
<p> 
 A common question among people in the accessibility field is
 simply – “why games?” Why should we care about a few
 teenagers having a bit of fun, when there are so many other
 serious challenges that need addressing?
</p>
<p> 
 There are two key issues here: the scale of the industry; and the
 personal benefits. In terms of value the games sector is not far
 short of being a twelve-figure industry, roughly on a par with
 books, way ahead of music, films and DVDs and second only
 to television. Already, there are more twice as many female
 gamers over 18 as male gamers under 18.
</p>
<p> 
 Furthermore, research commissioned by US video game
 developer PopCap
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/PYsRwl">http://bit.ly/PYsRwl</a>
 ) showed a higher proportion of people with disabilities among gamers than in the general population.
 Games can be a huge contributor to quality of life for people
 who have limited recreation options, but they also enable
 access to culture and socialising, and can have therapeutic
 benefits (even being prescribed by doctors in some cases). In
 multiplayer games and virtual worlds, everyone is able to
 participate on a level playing field, with players’ first
 impressions of someone being based on how they play the
 game and what they say, not on any disability they may have.
</p>
<p> 
 It is not uncommon to hear of games having a truly life-
 changing effect. For example, one young man was in a horrific
 accident which left him quadriplegic and in despair, thinking
 his life was over, but he was then brought back from the brink
 through discovering gaming. He had found something
 meaningful that he was able to do independently. What brought
 this about were game developers simply allowing button
 configuration so he could move essential controls from the
 front to the top of his controller, meaning that although he had
 little fine motor control in his fingers, he could operate the
 buttons by moving his arms and wrists.
</p>
<p> 
 There are a few differences to how accessibility in games
 works compared to other industries. To meet the definition of
 “game” as opposed to a toy or an interactive narrative, there
 must be a challenge to overcome, a test of some kind of skill.
 Every challenge will be a barrier for some people, so universal
 design in its truest sense cannot really exist in games. However,
 because games are so technology-focused, there is great
 accessibility potential and a great deal that can be done to
 avoid unnecessary barriers.
</p>
<p> 
 Some of this potential can be achieved through: inclusive
 design, such as avoiding use of colour as a sole means of
 communicating information; providing gamers with options
 such as a choice of difficulty level or being able to configure
 which button does what on your controller; and providing
 support for assistive technologies such as switches or screen-
 readers.
</p>
<p> 
 There are some very common impairments that affect gaming,
 such as colour-blindness or impaired reading ability, translating
 into huge amounts of lost business, yet many access problems
 are cheap and easy to fix if considered early enough. The
 situation is rapidly improving, but the games industry still lags
 way behind others, and a large part of that is down to
 awareness.
</p>
<p> 
 There have been many attempts over the years to produce
 game accessibility resources, but these have generally been
 either too short or too detailed to be a practical reference for
 developers.
</p>
<p> 
 So in 2012 a group of game developers, accessibility specialists
 and academics collaborated to produce a set of game
 accessibility guidelines, divided into levels based on a balance
 of reach, impact and – uniquely – cost.
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines were launched in September 2012, at:
 <a href="http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com">http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 They are communicated in developer-friendly language,
 together with examples of best practice, and have already been
 used by many developers, publishers and universities around
 the world. They have even been used by the Australian
 Government as part of the application process for its 20-
 million-dollar games industry funding programme.
</p>
<p> 
 Looking ahead, as gaming technology continues to change
 rapidly, each new generation of devices will bring its own new
 potential accessibility benefits and hurdles, from motion and
 speech detection to touch-screen interaction and multi-touch
 gestures.
</p>
<p> 
 Two developments that have made a really significant
 difference in recent years have been mobile screen-readers and
 connected gaming.
</p>
<p> 
 Blind-accessible games have traditionally been a highly
 specialist area, but mobile devices have changed this. Users
 can now navigate using a mobile screen-reader, by dragging a
 finger around the screen. The screen-reader then describes
 what element the user’s finger is over, meaning that the finger
 can essentially be used to perform the same functions that an
 eye normally would, and the user can explore the screen in a
 similar way to a sighted person.
</p>
<p> 
 Also, unlike console games, many mobile games are based on
 navigating simple interfaces rather than complex 3D
 environments. These two factors combined have made it far
 easier to develop blind-accessible games – so easy, in fact, that
 Zynga, creators of the popular Farmville and Words with
 Friends games, actually managed to make their Hanging with
 Friends game blind-accessible by accident, simply by labelling
 elements correctly.
</p>
<p> 
 Games also allow reporting back of analytics over the internet,
 and this, too, has huge potential. While it is very difficult to
 find out how many people enter a building using a wheelchair
 ramp rather than stairs, or to know how many people accessing
 your website are colour blind, in games you can find out
 exactly how many of your players configure their controls or
 turn on subtitles, meaning accurate business cases can be
 formed.
</p>
<p> 
 One example of this is MUDRammer, a recent game designed
 for Apple’s iOS operating system which was made screen-
 reader accessible by its developer, Jonathan Hersh. Based on
 prevalence statistics you might guess that 1% of the players
 might be blind, but thanks to a single line of code the
 developer was able to find out that up to 10% of the players
 were screen-reader users. His game sells for five US Dollars, so
 the 24 hours work he put into making it accessible generated a
 profit “more or less immediately”, says Hersh.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, there is a great opportunity at the moment to spread
 knowledge, educate game developers, and build some good
 foundations that will stay relevant for years to come, making a
 real difference to many people’s quality of life.
</p>
