<h3 id="i55-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Supermarket Web Sites Fail Basic Checks.</h3>
<p>  
 Only one of the UK's top five supermarkets has a web site that meets
 even the most basic accessibility needs of disabled consumers, a survey
 by the charity AbilityNet (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org">http://www.abilitynet.org</a>
) has found.</p>
<p>  
 'State of the e-nation: online supermarkets' is an audit of web sites
 operated by Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys, Somerfield and Tesco. Each
 site was tested for usability and accessibility using Watchfire's
 'Bobby' software (<a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com">http://bobby.watchfire.com</a>
) and a range of manual checks. The sites were then ranked on a five-star scale, where one star
 signifies "very inaccessible" and five stars mean "very accessible."
</p>
<p>  
 The highest score of four stars went to Tesco's 'alternative' site -
 <a href="http://www.tesco.com/access">http://www.tesco.com/access</a>
 - which was the only site that could be easily accessed by those with visual impairments, dyslexia or a
 physical disability. Asda (<a href="http://www.asda.co.uk">http://www.asda.co.uk</a>
), Morrisons (<a href="http://www.morereasons.co.uk">http://www.morereasons.co.uk</a>
) and Sainsburys (<a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk">http://www.sainsburys.co.uk</a>
) scored one star each, while Somerfield (<a href="http://www.somerfield.co.uk">http://www.somerfield.co.uk</a>
) and Tesco's mainstream site (<a href="http://www.tesco.com">http://www.tesco.com</a>
) fared marginally better with two stars.</p>
<p>  
 Common problems encountered by AbilityNet's researchers included
 "hard-coded" text which could not be enlarged; a lack of text labels for
 images; and the use of JavaScript mini-programmes which aren't
 recognised by some older browsers or by some of the specialist
 browsers used by the visually impaired.
</p>
<p>  
 The report praised Somerfield for having the "most accessible of the
 'mainstream' supermarket web sites." However, its site is not e-
 commerce enabled and so doesn't offer the convenience of online
 shopping for disabled users, said the report.
</p>
<p>  
 "We are quite pleased with our two-star ranking, which is better than
 some of the other supermarket sites," said Nicholas Hall, marketing
 controller at Somerfield. "But we don't think we should be harshly
 judged for not offering an e-commerce site. It is a deliberate part of our
 strategy not to be an e-commerce operation, because we are a local
 high-street retailer that encourages people to physically visit our stores.
 We aren't like some of the larger supermarkets who often have stores
 out of town and are more suited to an e-commerce offering."
</p>
<p>  
 Asda, Morrisons, Sainsburys and Somerfield have made pledges to
 improve the accessibility of their sites. The report says that by having
 inaccessible sites, the supermarkets are missing out on a market of over
 seven million people with an estimated spending power of 120 billion
 pounds a year.
</p>
<h3 id="i55-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Personal Navigation System To Be Tested In Finland.</h3>
<p>  
 Testing of a personal navigation system for blind and vision-impaired
 people will begin this summer in the Finnish cities of Helsinki and
 Tampere.
</p>
<p>  
 The system, called NOPPA, has been developed by the Technical
 Research Centre of Finland (VTT - <a href="http://www.vtt.fi">http://www.vtt.fi</a>
), a government- owned agency. It combines mobile phone, wireless internet, global
 positioning system (GPS) and voice technologies to guide users around
 town and to help them use public transport. It is part of a 465,000 euro,
 three-year pilot, funded by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and
 Communications
 (<a href="http://www.mintc.fi/www/sivut/english/default.html">http://www.mintc.fi/www/sivut/english/default.html</a>
), the Arla Institute (<a href="http://www.arlainst.fi/englisht.htm">http://www.arlainst.fi/englisht.htm</a>
) and the Finnish Federation of the Visually Impaired (<a href="http://www.nkl.fi/english">http://www.nkl.fi/english</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 The navigation system uses a 3G mobile phone with GPRS (General
 Packet Radio Service) and Bluetooth connectivity, coupled with a GPS
 device. It connects to public transport information, such as timetables
 and municipal route plans, which can be queried using speech
 recognition and production software.
</p>
<p>  
 "Our specially designed information server acts as the interpreter
 between the services available and the user," says Ari Virtanen,
 research scientist at VTT. "It handles the speech interface and does all
 the hard work of relaying users' queries to the services and feeding
 back the response."
</p>
<p>  
 The result is that a blind or vision-impaired person can use the system
 to plan their trip with real-time access to bus, train and tram timetables,
 as well as up-to-date information about roadworks and possible
 obstacles. The system can also guide them to their relevant public
 transport stop, inform them when the vehicle arrives and tell them
 where to get off. The idea is that it acts as a complement to rather than
 a replacement for a guide dog or white stick.
</p>
<p>  
 NOPPA will be formally evaluated by blind and visually impaired
 users from August to September 2004. However, VTT says that the
 system is also suitable for guiding people with normal eyesight or
 people who travel a lot for their work. Although VTT isn't a
 commercial organisation, its research often forms the basis of
 marketable products and Vitanen is confident that the product has a
 commercial future. "I think that NOPPA will be in common usage in
 the next five to ten years," he says.
</p>
<h3 id="i55-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Un Employment Programme Announced For Ethiopia.</h3>
<p>  
 A training programme to create employment opportunities for people
 with visual disabilities in Ethiopia is set to be launched by the United
 Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO -
 <a href="http://www.unesco.org">http://www.unesco.org</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 The programme will be delivered in partnership with the Adaptive
 Technology Centre for the Blind (ATCB -
 <a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/tamru">http://www3.sympatico.ca/tamru</a>
), an Ethiopian organisation which conducts training with adaptive technology for the country's vision-
 impaired community. According to its latest census figures, Ethiopia
 has some 500,000 blind people, while Africa has the majority of the
 world's 45 million blind people, according to the International Eye
 Foundation (<a href="http://www.iefusa.org">http://www.iefusa.org</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 UNESCO and ATCB have been working together since 2003, when
 they jointly established a computer training centre for people with
 impaired vision in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. This latest
 project will set up an employment-oriented training centre for the
 visually impaired, develop a training curriculum and train at least 50
 people with a view to them gaining jobs using their ICT skills.
</p>
<p>  
 The employment project is one of UNESCO's contributions to the
 realisation of the action plan drawn up by the UN's recent World
 Summit on the Information Society (<a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis">http://www.itu.int/wsis</a>
), which highlighted the need for ensuring access to ICTs by disadvantaged
 groups. "ICTs offer individuals the ability to . . . access knowledge by
 adapting digital media to the nature of their disabilities and to enhance
 their social and economic integration in communities by enlarging the
 scope of activities available to them," said a UNESCO statement. It is
 hoped that these projects will act as a model for other similar initiatives
 in Africa.
</p>
<h3 id="i55-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Satellite Audio Description Service To Cover All Channels.</h3>
<p>  
 Vision-impaired users of the UK's satellite TV service Sky will soon
 be able to receive audio-described programmes across all mainstream
 channels, after the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 announced they are to
 begin supporting the service from early autumn.
</p>
<p>  
 Until now, Britain's seven million Sky customers have only had access
 to audio description on Sky One, Five, and Sky's premiere Movie,
 Sports and Travel channels but they will now be able to receive audio
 described programmes on BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, Cbeebies,
 CBBC, ITV1, ITV2 and Channel 4 by setting the set top box to
 "narrative" mode from the language menu.
</p>
<p>  
 However, users of the service will not be able to alter the volume of the
 audio description - which will be audible to everybody in the room
 because there is no way of isolating it - meaning it could potentially be
 drowned out by other noise. RNIB campaigns officer for accessible
 information Julianne Marriot welcomed the development but said it
 was "a more cheap and cheerful method" than the fully accessible
 Netgem set top box (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 49, January 2004 and
 issue 51, March 2004).
</p>
<p>  
 The RNIB is also continuing to campaign for an increase from 10 per
 cent of the government-set targets for the proportion of all programmes
 that are required to be audio-described. The institute is also calling for
 Sky to broadcast on the same system as the BBC-led digital terrestrial
 service Freeview in the future because it says it is technically superior,
 allowing users to listen to audio description using headphones and to
 adjust the volume. It is also trying to persuade cable platforms
 Telewest and ntl to provide audio-description through their set-top
 boxes.
</p>
<p>  
 Meanwhile the broadcasting regulator Ofcom
 (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">http://www.ofcom.org.uk</a>
), has drawn up a draft code on subtitling, signing and audio description, due to be published later this month.
 The body has a duty under the 2003 Communications Act to encourage
 manufacturers to develop equipment which can be easily used by
 people with disabilities.

<h3 id="i55-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: DOUBLE PLIGHT:</h3>
<p>  DPM Weerakkody, Professor of Western Classics at the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka, writes in with
 advice for our recent correspondent who wrote asking for advice on
 affordable access products on behalf of a nurse whose 13-year-old son
 Rafail is blind.
</p>
<p>  
 "The sad plight of Rafail is, unfortunately, the same plight of all
 vision-impaired people in the so-called 'Third World'," he says. "We
 are doubly handicapped by being blind as well as by being born in the
 Third World. We very much wish to be computer-literate, and there is
 no doubt that computers can contribute to our education and
 employment prospects. But we cannot afford the colossal sums
 required to buy the access software. I have a few suggestions for
 Rafail, but these may not be all that satisfactory.
</p>
<p>  
 "First, obtain a demonstration version of [the screenreader] JAWS, or
 Window-Eyes, or HAL, which will allow him to use the computer for
 30 or so minutes at one time. Second, install Windows 3.1 and
 download JAWS 2.0 free of charge. Finally, there are some less
 expensive screen readers, such as Lookout, but I have not tried them,
 so I do not know how useful they are. There are also some Indian
 programmes which are either free or cost little. Obviously, all these
 suggestions have their drawbacks, and none of them may be totally
 satisfying."
</p>
<p>  
 NOTE: For a feature by Professor Weerakkody on access to
 technology in the developing world see 'Divided we stand', E-Access
 Bulletin, issue 34, October 2002.
</p>
<h3 id="i55-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: MONEY TALKS:</h3>
<p>  Further to our recent piece on accessibility issues with the new 'Chip and PIN' credit card system and many
 banks' failure to explain the alternatives, Clare Page writes: "I have
 just read [your] article about the problems with the alternative to typing
 in a PIN number when using a UK credit card. I am curious as to why
 there should be a problem with typing in a PIN number, or the need for
 an alternative.
</p>
<p>  
 "Ever since I have lived in France, anyone here with a credit card has
 had a PIN number, which can be used in any place where the card is
 accepted. I use a French credit card myself, and when I type in my PIN
 number, the only problem I sometimes have is knowing where the
 button to validate it is: although the numbers on the keypads here are
 usually in the same order on every pad, the pads themselves are not
 standardised, so the "validate" button is not always in the same
 position.
</p>
<p>  
 "So I am curious to know what prevents visually impaired British
 credit card holders from using their PIN numbers to make purchases as
 the French do?"
</p>
<p>  
 And Amar Latif, Senior Financial Analyst at BT Global Services, has
 another query about accessible banking, as well as some valuable tips
 about how to make the banks do your bidding: "I am registered blind,
 and do not use Braille. The banks have said they can send out an audio
 cassette with my statement. However, I have told them that this is such
 an inconvenient medium.
</p>
<p>  
 "Now that blind people use computers, it would be so simple to receive
 your statement on email. This way, it would be easy to analyse.
 However, they say this would be insecure. My answer to that has been
 that we don't need our account number on the email, just a list of
 transactions. They then say this is not technically possible, which I find
 very hard to believe. I have been chasing banks to provide this service
 for the past two years. I am getting very frustrated and wonder if
 something can be done collectively.
</p>
<p>  
 "I receive my credit card statements on email. Even they had given me
 the same reasons as the banks, however, they do now provide the
 statement less the account details. I achieved this by running a 3,000
 pound balance on my credit cards, and then demanding that I needed a
 suitable medium to read my statement before paying them off. Now I
 receive this and it is wonderful.
</p>
<p>  
 "Many banks mention that you can access their statements online.
 However, as we all know, it takes time logging onto the site, working
 out what you need to download and so on. If sighted people still
 receive their statements through their letterbox, then it is unfair that we
 have to go online; we need ours in our inbox.
</p>
<p>  
 "Your views on how this can be taken forward would be very much
 appreciated. In addition, are you able to ask your readers if they would
 prefer this medium, to judge how many people may be in the same
 boat as me?" [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i55-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: BRIDGE BUILDING:</h3>
<p>  In a recent issue a reader asked for information on an accessible computer game  version of the card game
 Bridge, and our regular correspondent Chris McMillan writes: "I don't
 play bridge, sighted or otherwise, but I did a quick search [which]
 revealed an upgrade for a game called 3D Bridge Deluxe (see
 <a href="http://news.freeverse.com/archives/000417.php">http://news.freeverse.com/archives/000417.php</a>
)."</p>
<p>  
 Chris also suggested that our reader contact Tom Lorimer of
 Whitestick, who "probably knows more about accessible games than
 anyone else in the UK. He certainly has written lots over the years
 himself. He also has links on his web site
 (<a href="http://www.whitestick.co.uk">http://www.whitestick.co.uk</a>
) to lots of other games sites and magazines."
</p>
<h3 id="i55-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: VALIDATOR DEFENCE:</h3>
<p>  Bart Simons, Web Accessibility Specialist at the Belgian e-government solutions firm ASCii, writes in
 to defend the World Wide Web Consortium's HTML Validator
 (<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>
) which our reader Karina Gregory found "incredibly difficult to use" (see inbox, previous issue).
</p>
<p>  
 He says: "I really don't see the problem here. I use that validator daily.
 I am blind and use JAWS. If a page is valid you know this by pressing
 'h' twice and you'll land on the message "this page is valid". If there
 are errors you just press 'l' to access the list of errors. The page can't
 be called inaccessible. I would point to the W3C WAI interest group
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/</a>
) if Karina likes to discuss this issue."</p>
<h3 id="i55-12"><b class="Ps">+</b>12: AUDIO DEMAND:</h3>
<p>  John Loader of DotSix Brailling Services writes in for information about audio versions of leaflets available on
 demand over the web. "I run a not-for-profit Braille, audio, large print
 and tactile diagram company and, with the advent of broadband, I feel
 that there is scope for organisations like councils, rather than get me to
 produce umpteen tapes for leaflets, newsletters and so on, to have a
 recording on their website for either audio streaming or straight file
 download. Is anyone doing this that I can consult on what is necessary?

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Interview- Paul Blenkhorn.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Life On The Front Lineby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p>  
 Paul Blenkhorn, professor of assistive technology at the University of
 Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), is no out-
 of-touch academic. His work at UMIST is practical and focused on the
 real world, like all his work in a 20-year career which has seen him
 create some of the most widely-used assistive technology tools in the
 world.
</p>
<p>  
 Blenkhorn started his career in the early 1980s working with vision-
 impaired children as a research fellow at the Research Centre for the
 Visually Handicapped in Birmingham, now the Visual Impairment
 Centre for Teaching and Research (VICTAR -
 <a href="http://www.education.bham.ac.uk/research/victar">http://www.education.bham.ac.uk/research/victar</a>
). Together with a colleague Eamonn Fetton, now RNIB's director of education and
 employment, he drove a minibus to every school for blind children in
 the country, demonstrating software; gleaning ideas from teachers and
 pupils and helping to produce a termly newsletter for communication
 aids for disabled children.
</p>
<p>  
 "In those days, there were two BBC Micros [a type of early desktop
 computer made by Acorn] per school: but it's not those sort of pioneer
 years any more," he says.
</p>
<p>  
 Then in 1986, after leaving the Birmingham research centre, Blenkhorn
 created a piece of access technology history: "I started a company with
 a friend called Dolphin (<a href="http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/</a>
)." He went on to design what have become some of the household names in the world of
 assistive technologies including the Apollo speech synthesiser and the
 screen-reader packages HAL and Narrator
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/narrator1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/narrator1</a>
), of which the latter is now used in every Windows 2000 and Windows XP package, and is the
 invention of which Blenkhorn says he is most proud.
</p>
<p>  
 On leaving Dolphin in 1991, he went back to academia and took up a
 post at UMIST, where he was made professor of assistive technology
 three years ago. During this time, he has worked mainly on assistive
 technology for people with a print impairment which covers those with
 dyslexia as well as those with a vision impairment.
</p>
<p>  
 Blenkholrn's work spreads beyond the UK. Alva, the Braille devices
 company based in the Netherlands uses a Braille translation tool
 developed by Blenkhorn for their mobile phone.
 And he is currently working through UMIST with Spanish blindness
 organisation ONCE on a partnership project beginning in January
 called 'Red de solidaridad con los ciegos de Am&#233;rica Latina (Red
 Social - 'solidarity network for blind organisations of South America')
 in  Columbia; Cuba; Guatemala; Mexico; and Peru. The scheme is
 designed to encourage people in those countries to use screen readers
 and other assistive technologies and to campaign to make them
 affordable. Software will be translated into Spanish and indigenous
 languages such as Maya.
</p>
<p>  
 Last week, Blenkhorn met with representatives of the Association of
 the Blind of Prizren, Kosovo after the body received government
 funding for a project starting in August. He is planning the building of
 an Albanian screen reader.
</p>
<p>  
 Having been in the business of assistive technology for two decades
 that have seen a particularly rapid rate of development, what does
 Blenkhorn see as the biggest changes in the field? "The biggest change
 reflects society and charities. For me, most of what I see out there is
 about business, not users: the focus has shifted. Everything now has a
 cost and not necessarily a value."
</p>
<p>  
 In an attempt to redress the balance, and return control to the hands of
 users, Blenkhorn has set up a new company called Sensory Software
 (<a href="http://sonantsoft.com/sensory">http://sonantsoft.com/sensory</a>
) whose 'LookOUT' screenreader sells in the UK for around 80 pounds compared with more usual
 screenreader costs of between 400 and 900 pounds. This and the
 company's other products are designed to be extremely simple, he
 says, since 95 per cent of people with low vision don't need very much
 in terms of different functions. In fact, the goal for him in designing a
 screen reader was to make the user interface straightforward. "There's
 a real need for simple, straightforward [products] for ordinary people
 to use. It's not about ivory tower research, it's about getting it out
 there."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Opinion- Access to knowledge.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: The Weight Of Evidenceby Kevin Carey.
</h3>
<p>  
 Recent research by Zoe Neumann of the RNIB showed that people
 with impaired vision using web-based educational materials spend 70
 per cent of their time faffing about (my term, not hers) and only 30 per
 cent of their time directly using the resources (see E-Access Bulletin,
 issue 53, May 2004). This finding fits grimly with separate Disability
 Rights Commission research which found that of all disability groups,
 blind people show the lowest rates of task completion on the web at 53
 per cent, compared with an average for all disabilities of 76 per cent.
</p>
<p>  
 Both these findings also fit with a third lot of research undertaken by
 Forrester for Microsoft which ranks 'Likelihood to benefit from the use
 of accessible technology by type of difficulty/impairment among
 computer users' (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/forrester1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/forrester1</a>
). In the table for mild disabilities, people with impaired vision are ranked third
 behind manual dexterity and hearing but in the rankings for severe
 disability, vision-impaired people come top with 11.1 million people
 likely to benefit, with manual dexterity in second (6.8 million).
</p>
<p>  
 I want to add only one piece of objective but unpublished data to this
 sorry tale: when I worked on research into the typographical reading
 preferences of vision-impaired teenagers (published in the article
 headed 'Size counts' in the British Journal of Visual Impairment,
 volume 17, 1999), of the group I observed in a further education
 college only one student read anything outside the set curriculum.
</p>
<p>  
 So we can readily conclude from all this data that gathering
 information from the internet poses severe problems for people with
 impaired vision, and that these are compounded by difficulties with
 handling enlarged print. As for tape and Braille users, they may have
 all the facility in the world with their medium but the quantity of
 material available to them is pathetically low. I have just finished a
 part-time course which required the study of classic texts and modern
 interpretations; the former were all available, but the latter non-
 existent. The RNIB provided a brilliant service but the Braille and even
 tape resources available were paltry.
</p>
<p>  
 In a society of conflicting needs and limited resources you have to ask
 whether the struggle is worth the effort. The answer has to be positive
 but, not for the first time, we should be discussing voluntary sector
 capacity rather than rights. There is not much point, other than the
 symbolic, in international organisations and national governments
 legislating ends but ignoring means.
</p>
<p>  
 The one key conclusion I draw from all this data is that the government
 must at last begin to take seriously the task of facilitating information.
 As Vice Chair of RNIB I am reluctant to specify that we should be the
 agent of government funding for this purpose but there is now an
 overwhelming case for the voluntary sector as a whole in the field of
 vision impairment to work in partnership to provide appropriate and
 timely information.
</p>
<p>  
 In the age of classic text, blind people could, with enormous effort and
 ingenuity, hope to compete with sighted peers in such areas as classics,
 literature, law, theology, philosophy and even some branches of
 theoretical science. At work they could hope to succeed in jobs where
 the frameworks and practices were stable over decades. But now all
 that has changed, and there have not been consequently radical changes
 in provision of support for them.
</p>
<p>  
 Of course we will all continue to campaign for more accessible web
 sites, more inclusive e-learning and more market sensitive operating
 systems and software, but in parallel we need to campaign for in-sector
 facilitation. Without it, the gap between people with impaired vision
 and the rest of society will widen still further.
