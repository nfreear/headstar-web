<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: 'Chip And Pin' Bank Card System Under Fire.</h3>
<p> 
 High street retailers face prosecution under the Disability
 Discrimination Act because new 'Chip and PIN' technology being
 introduced across the UK may not be accessible to people with
 disabilities, according to Qm Group (<a href="http://www.Qmgroup.com">http://www.Qmgroup.com</a>
), a designer of public information and queue management systems.
</p>
<p> 
 The chip and PIN technology is designed to combat fraud by requiring
 customers to input a number at the point of sale instead of signing for
 purchases. It has currently been introduced in some 438,000 retail
 outlets across the UK and all retailers must adopt the technology by
 January 2005 if they wish to remain protected by banks against
 fraudulent transactions.
</p>
<p> 
 However, most keypads for inputting PIN numbers aren't accessible to
 people with disabilities, says Qm Group. They lack inclusive design
 features, such as display screens capable of showing large numbers and
 letters, keyboards with tactile markings, a "pip" on the number 5 key to
 provide a reference point for vision impaired people, and separate
 colour schemes for numerical and function keys. Qm has also criticised
 the physical location of keypads on counters, which it says makes them
 inaccessible to wheelchair users.
</p>
<p> 
 But the chip and PIN programme management organisation
 (<a href="http://www.chipandpin.co.uk">http://www.chipandpin.co.uk</a>
), set up by the British Retail Consortium (<a href="http://www.brc.org.uk">http://www.brc.org.uk</a>
) and the financial clearing house APACS (<a href="http://www.apacs.org.uk">http://www.apacs.org.uk</a>
), has hit back at the Qm claims. It says it ran trials that included vision impaired people, which showed that 93 per
 cent of vision impaired people were happy using chip and PIN.
</p>
<p> 
 The organisation also says that the vast majority of keypads not only
 incorporate the "pip" on the number 5 key to aid navigation for blind
 and visually impaired users, but also have an extendable cord so they
 can be used below counter level by wheelchair users. It says
 accessibility advice was issued to all keypad manufacturers - around
 five firms in all - although it admits the devices do not conform to a
 standard design.
</p>
<p> 
 However Paul Snee, inclusivity manager at Qm Group, says it is this
 lack of conformity that is causing problems. "The cancel and clear
 keys are in different places on different keypads," said Snee. "Some of
 the keys are vertical and some are horizontal and they don't include
 tactile markings. This hardware marginalises and discriminates against
 those with disabilities."
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Us Disability Law Unravels Over Web.</h3>
<p> 
 A US court of appeal has ruled that organisations providing online
 services don't need to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act
 (ADA - <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/statute.html">http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/statute.html</a>
), adding to confusion about how anti-discrimination legislation applies to web
 sites in the US.
</p>
<p> 
 The decision, which upholds a 2002 ruling by a district judge that the
 ADA applies only to physical spaces and not to web sites, once again
 highlights ambiguities in the law, which is interpreted differently from
 state to state.
</p>
<p> 
 The lawsuit was originally filed by campaign group Access Now
 (<a href="http://www.adaaccessnow.org/">http://www.adaaccessnow.org/</a>
) and blind web user Robert Gumson against Southwest Airlines (<a href="http://www.southwest.com">http://www.southwest.com</a>
). They argued it was "extremely difficult" for vision impaired people to buy tickets
 on the Southwest web site, that there were no text alternatives to
 graphics, and that navigating the site was difficult.
</p>
<p> 
 In October 2002, a Florida district judge rejected the Gumson claim on
 the grounds that the ADA doesn't apply to web sites, and it is this
 decision that has been upheld by the court of appeal. However, since
 the original lawsuit Southwest has redesigned its web site to make it
 easier to use by vision impaired people.
</p>
<p> 
 This latest ruling follows hot on the heels of a case in August, which
 produced the opposite outcome, with the New York State Attorney-
 General forcing two high-profile leisure companies to make their web
 sites fully accessible after ruling that they were in violation of the
 ADA (see E-Access Bulletin, September 2004).
</p>
<p> 
 The ADA dictates that "all places of public accommodation" and "all
 goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodation"
 must be made accessible to people with disabilities. But it was made
 law before the internet became mainstream, and doesn't explicitly
 mention web sites.
</p>
<p> 
 There is no such ambiguity in the UK's Disability Discrimination Act
 and the supporting codes of practice published by the Disability Rights
 Commission (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
), which make it clear that web site owners must make their sites accessible to people with disabilities or
 face legal action.
</p>
<h3 id="i58-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Online Forms Could Boost Patient Power.</h3>
<p> 
 Disability groups are being consulted about a service that would enable
 patients to supply details of their symptoms, medical history and
 treatment preferences online ahead of a consultation with a doctor or
 clinician, reducing the need for basic and often repetitive questions to
 be asked at each appointment.
</p>
<p> 
 At a meeting this month organised by the British Computer Society
 Disability Group (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bcs2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bcs2</a>
), NHS policymakers met with disability groups to gauge demand for such a
 service, which is increasingly used by healthcare providers in the US
 and mainland Europe but has yet to be adopted by the health service
 here.
</p>
<p> 
 The service would prompt patients to supply information through a
 structured online questionnaire. "An awful lot of information could be
 provided in advance," said Brian Layzell of the British Computer
 Society. "People with disabilities could find such a service particularly
 useful."
</p>
<p> 
 Although the NHS has not committed itself to rolling out the service,
 Layzell is confident the government will support further tests of
 commercially available products. "One of the outcomes of the meeting
 is likely to be a pilot project launching early next year," he said.

<p>  Further to our recent discussion about problems with the Tesco supermarket's web site and credit card
 purchasing systems, Jonathan Tyrer of the RNIB says: "I've been using
 the Tesco access site for over two years now. I've had the odd problem,
 but on the whole I think it's a fantastic service and it annoys me when I
 see the sort of negative, unhelpful comments you've had in your last
 two issues. If people don't like it, don't use it - get a taxi and go
 yourself! Good luck!"
</p>
<p> 
 And further to the related discussion of the accessibility of the new
 'Chip and PIN' credit card authentication system, Debbie Payne of
 Hereford responds to Danielle Cleary's account of being refused a
 purchase after her signatures didn't match, even though she was blind.
 "I'm horrified by the treatment she received. I've suffered similar
 discrimination in a well known high street shoe store. I was also told
 that my signatures didn't match, so I kicked up a stink and threatened
 to report the store for their treatment. For the record, I did leave the
 store with my shoes. However, that's by the by. The point I'd like to
 make, is that both Danielle and myself are a case in point in support of
 Chip and PIN. For heaven's sake, let's stop bleating about how difficult
 or not it might be, let's embrace it and look forward positively to our
 new freedom to shop with confidence." [Further responses to

<p>Section Three: Focus: internet TV</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Community Of The Futureby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 AT508.com (<a href="http://www.at508.com">http://www.at508.com</a>
) is an internet TV station dedicated to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
 (<a href="http://www.section508.gov/">http://www.section508.gov/</a>
), the part of US law which requires US federal government agencies to make their information technology
 accessible to people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The channel provides a forum for live debate and links government
 agency representatives, the public, technology companies and
 advocacy groups, bringing together key players in the field of access
 technology. Webcast panel discussions allow viewers and listeners to
 interact with guests by email and the station also covers major events
 such as the international assistive technology conference 'CSUN'
 (<a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 According to Dave Gardy, chief executive of the station's creator TV
 Worldwide (<a href="http://www.tvworldwide.com">http://www.tvworldwide.com</a>
), the service has grown into one of the most active of their 20 internet television stations.
</p>
<p> 
 AT508.com founder and technology journalist John Williams first
 approached Gardy about starting up the channel after he started
 receiving enquiries about the new legislation. "I saw the deed on 508
 become closer to becoming law [and] started to get a lot of calls and
 emails asking me questions about 508," Williams says.
</p>
<p> 
 Launched two years ago at the World Congress on Disabilities
 (<a href="http://www.wcdexpo.com">http://www.wcdexpo.com</a>
) in Florida, Gardy says webcasts regularly receive around 30,000 viewers and listeners and up to 200 emails per
 webcast. With around five per cent of content available only by pay-
 per-view, most of the site is free to access, with the service gaining
 most of its revenue from corporate sponsorship.
</p>
<p> 
 There are three main advantages of web broadcasting compared with
 TV or radio broadcasting, Gardy says: "The distinct advantages are the
 interactivity; the archivability and most importantly, the community."
</p>
<p> 
 A hot topic currently under discussion on the channel is the effects of
 the law on the IT giants. "They are frustrated because several
 [government] agencies are not enforcing it. Businesses supported 508
 in the belief that once they showed the will to support 508, the
 administration would, then there would be a trickle-down effect,"
 Williams says.
</p>
<p> 
 But channel AT508.com webcasts are not always free of controversy.
 "There have been shows that have not pleased the government,"
 Williams says. "But that's OK, because the government has to be taken
 to task when it doesn't do its job."
</p>
<p> 
 Last year, Williams and Gardy planned a show with representatives
 from federal government and the American Association of People with
 Disabilities (<a href="http://www.aapd-dc.org">http://www.aapd-dc.org</a>
). "Our aim was to talk about the strengths and weaknesses of Section 508. We got a lot of calls from
 government and businesses," he says. Specifically the team were
 warned that strong criticisms of government or business could lose the
 channel goodwill and support.
</p>
<p> 
 "We sat down and I said let's do this. We can't afford to buckle, that
 goes against everything democracy stands for. We got a lot of feedback
 from government listeners [who] said they liked it. They liked the fact
 we weren't ducking issues," Williams says. However, the White House
 called Williams to tell him they disapproved.
</p>
<p> 
 One major annoyance for Williams is that few government
 departments take a strong approach to compliance, and no single
 agency is given responsibility for enforcing Section 508. "[The
 Department of Homeland Security] could be role models for enforcing
 508," he says. "Some departments within federal agencies were
 enforcing 508 and most were not." This, he said, inspired yet another
 show.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's an emerging field which is probably still in its embryonic stages,
 but one of these days, it's just going to zoom," Williams says. "I think
 you'll see that in the next five years." It seems as if the panellists will
 have plenty to talk about on AT508.com for some time to come.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Web Standards- HTML.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Strict Standards Make Accessible Sitesby Jim Byrne.
</h3>
<p> 
 There have been many different versions of Hypertext Markup
 Language (HTML) since the World Wide Web was invented in the
 early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee. The rules for each version are
 encapsulated in the standards published by the World Wide Web
 Consortium (W3C).
</p>
<p> 
 The standards dictate the tags publishers are allowed to use, and in
 what order, and how those tags should be interpreted by browsers. For
 example, text within header tags are interpreted as headings, text
 within paragraph tags are interpreted as paragraphs, and so on.
</p>
<p> 
 It is said, usually with irony, that the great thing about standards is that
 there are so many to choose from, and in this case it is quite true.
 However, if you are beginner, you won't go far wrong if you decide to
 use the latest and final version of HTML released by the W3C, which
 is known as HTML 4.01 Strict. This is a good standard to adopt as it
 will never change, giving a solid, reliable way to mark up your pages
 that web browsers will understand for a good while yet.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Strict' part of the name means that you should not use tags and
 attributes that are no longer part of the final HTML standard. The
 jargon used when referring to these non-standard tags and attributes is
 'deprecated'. Staying away from deprecated tags and attributes removes
 a few more potential barriers to accessibility for your visitors.
</p>
<p> 
 Using HTML in a standard way means you have to put the correct tags
 around the appropriate document structures. Headings should be
 marked up using heading tags, lists should be marked up using list
 tags, passages of quotation should be marked up with the blockquote
 element, and so on. The W3C provide a free validation tool to check
 whether your document is valid HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Once a document has been created using standard HTML you can alter
 the way it is presented by using different 'style sheets' in much the
 same way you can alter the look of the text in a Microsoft Word
 document. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) contain information to set,
 among other things, the size and colour of headings, the justification of
 text, the layout of the page, and so on. In other words CSS should be
 used to provide information about how the page looks for visual users,
 and in more general terms, how it is presented to different types of user
 and 'user agents', such as browsers for example.
</p>
<p> 
 HTML should ideally be used only to markup the structure of your
 document, indicating what bits are headings, paragraphs, list, quotes,
 and so on, with CSS being used to determine how the document looks.
 By separating structure from presentation you are creating more
 flexible pages because a given user can then apply their own style
 sheet so that the content is presented in a way that suits their needs. On
 pages that do not use standard markup, style sheets may not work as
 expected.
</p>
<p> 
 Using standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) ensures that
 your pages will work on the widest range of hardware and software,
 including screen readers, for example. Pages using standard markup
 will also work more consistently on a wider range of browsers.
</p>
<p> 
 Further developments such as XHTML aim to provide more flexible
 and intelligent ways of adding labels to your web published
 documents. XHTML, for example, makes it easier for computers to
 process and transform documents into different formats. If you are a
 more experienced coder and you have the tools to ensure that you don't
 make mistakes when marking up documents, you may prefer to use
 XHTML 1 Strict. Adopting this more up-to-date standard will assist
 with accessibility, and help to 'future-proof' your pages.
