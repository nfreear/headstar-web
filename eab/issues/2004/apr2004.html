<h3 id="i52-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Wai Director Defends Validity Of Guidelines.</h3>
<p> 
 The director of the international Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3c.org/WAI">http://www.w3c.org/WAI</a>
), Judy Brewer, has defended her organisation's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10</a>
) - the accepted international standard in the field - following the appearance of research
 appearing to show gaps in their coverage.
</p>
<p> 
 Results of the world's most extensive programme of web accessibility
 research are being published today by the Disability Rights
 Commission of Great Britain (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
). The research was commissioned last year from the Centre for Human Computer
 Interaction Design at City University, which examined 1,000 web sites
 using a combination of automated software testing and task-based
 testing using groups of testers with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The WAI guidelines - which are divided into 'checkpoints' of levels
 'A', 'AA' and 'AAA' in order of increasing accessibility - were used
 as the main external benchmarks for the assessments. The team found
 that just 19 per cent of home pages passed on level 'A' checks, and
 when it came to level 'AA', just two sites out of the 1,000 (0.2 per
 cent) passed a series of automated and manual checks. No sites were
 found to reach 'AAA' compliance.
</p>
<p> 
 Researchers also found that only 55 per cent of specific usability
 problems reported by the testers were covered by any of the WCAG
 checkpoints, an apparent disjuncture between the WAI guidelines and
 real-life problems encountered. And many of the WAI checks seemed
 redundant, as they were almost always passed - some of the manual
 checks, for example, are passed up to 95 per cent of the time.
</p>
<p> 
 "This data could be used to refine WAI and make it more usable for
 people, because clearly web developers are struggling with WAI,"
 according to Professor Helen Petrie who led the research at City
 University. "But it also shows that WAI is not the be-all and
 end-all: people need to test their sites with real users."
</p>
<p> 
 WAI Director Judy Brewer told E-Access Bulletin this week that many
 of the general accessibility problems found which are not covered by
 WCAG are covered by WAI's User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10">http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10</a>
), which describe accessibility of browsers and media players and their interoperability with assistive
 technologies and complement the content guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 On the point that some checks seem barely worth including as they are
 passed by the great majority of sites, Brewer said: "WCAG includes
 checkpoints based on their priority for ensuring accessibility for
 people with disabilities, not on how frequently those checkpoints are
 already met on the average web site. [The guidelines are] already organised
 in  three priority levels, so web developers can initially address a
 relatively small set of issues that have the greatest impact on
 barrier-reduction."
</p>
<p> 
 Brewer said the new findings are not incompatible with WCAG, which
 "specifically address accessibility problems that create the most
 severe barriers for people with disabilities, not the broad spectrum of
 usability
 issues which affect all users. At the same time, WAI has always
 recognised the importance of incorporating user testing of
 accessibility
 features into a comprehensive evaluation of the accessibility of web
 sites." WAI is currently working on version 2.0 of WCAG, Brewer
 said, which may also address any remaining concerns about version
 1.0. "WAI . . . welcomes contributions such as the results of this
 research".

<h3 id="i52-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Apples To Speak.</h3>
<p> 
 Speech technology is to be integrated into new versions of the Apple
 Macintosh operating system, providing blind and vision-impaired users
 with access to its computers for the first time, technology giant
 Apple has announced.
</p>
<p> 
 The technology, known as Spoken Interface
 (<a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/spokeninterface">http://www.apple.com/accessibility/spokeninterface</a>
), includes voice output, sound cues, and enhanced keyboard functions to help users
 navigate through desktop items, menus, toolbars, palettes and other
 on-screen objects that were previously unavailable to them, and to help
 them use applications more easily. According to Apple, Spoken
 Interface will be integrated into the next major release of the
 operating system OSX.
</p>
<p> 
 For many blind computer users this will be their first chance to
 access Mac applications, since most developers of text-to-speech
 screen-readers have focused their efforts on desktop computers running
 Windows. The situation was made still worse last year when the
 specialist US access technology firm ALVA, creator of what has been
 until now the most widely available screen-reader for Macs
 'OutSPOKEN', announced it was to discontinue the product from the
 beginning of 2004, while honouring all warranties and service
 agreements which still apply.
</p>
<p> 
 "Until now, Apple's record on accessibility has been dreadful,"
 assistive technology consultant Peter Bosher told E-Access Bulletin
 this month. "There is some ability to change the size and type of
 screen
 fonts and on-screen switches, but that's about it. Blind people have
 had to avoid Apple Macs like the plague."
</p>
<p> 
 In particular, the new Macs will open up possibilities for blind
 people to use sound recording and editing equipment which is generally
 perceived as the music industry standard, Bosher said. "In recording
 studios Macs rather than PCs are the computers of choice. They are
 everywhere," he said.
</p>
<h3 id="i52-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Stockton Pioneers Talking Timetables.</h3>
<p> 
 A ground-breaking service providing travel information to people with
 impaired vision through handheld devices is being tested by residents
 of Stockton-on-Tees, paving the way for similar services to be
 introduced across the UK. Volunteers are using mobile phones to
 access real-time information about Stockton bus services, and fully
 searchable timetables stored on compact discs in the international
 DAISY talking book format (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/stockton1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/stockton1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Last month Transport Secretary Alistair Darling visited Stockton-on-
 Tees Borough Council - one of the project's partners - to meet
 volunteers and council staff, and to see the technology at work. "He
 was very interested in how DAISY timetables would be produced and
 the potential to make them available elsewhere in the UK if the
 Stockton scheme is successful," said a spokesperson for the council.
</p>
<p> 
 Other participants include Stockton Blind People's Voice
 (<a href="http://www.blindvoice.co.uk">http://www.blindvoice.co.uk</a>
), mobile phone operator Vodafone, the RNIB, and the Department for Transport, which has provided 153,000
 pounds to help fund the project.
</p>
<p> 
 According to borough council transport engineer John Kavanagh, using
 CDs to store timetables and digitised voice outputs to access the
 information is the most practical option for vision-impaired people.
 "Tapes are difficult to provide because they need replacing every
 time a service schedule changes, and users need to search to find the
 section
 they need. Braille is only used by some blind people and does not
 lend itself to production of timetables," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "The solution is to provide travellers with fully searchable CDs and
 the
 readers to enable them to access the data. No other authority in the
 UK has tried this."
</p>
<h3 id="i52-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Free Internet Safety Resource For Children.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB is to create a free resource on safe use of the internet by
 children and young people with impaired vision, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned. The resource is to be made available on the web and in
 several other formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The move comes as part of an ongoing strategic review by the
 institute
 of its technology services to children. A meeting last month held as
 part of the review process examined responses to questionnaire and
 focus-group research carried out into the use of assistive
 technologies by children of school age and their support by teachers.
</p>
<p> 
 Other issues covered at the meeting included the availability and
 consistency of training for education professionals and students on
 the use of assistive technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB's ICT development officer for children Will Pearson, who is
 leading the review, said the gap between young people obtaining
 assistive equipment and receiving training for its use has been too
 wide. There were problems to solve surrounding accreditation of
 trainers and availability of funds, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Pearson said teachers of visually-impaired students are often unaware
 of what support is available to their pupils, and are also failing to
 pursue accessibility concerns with computer network administrators at
 their schools.
</p>
<p> 
 The review is set to conclude with a final presentation of its
 findings in July.
 A separate RNIB report is due out in May on the findings of a joint
 project with the Department for Education and Skills looking at the
 experiences of vision-impaired students with the DAISY
 (<a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
) talking book system, and how the greatest benefits can be derived from DAISY materials.

<h3 id="i52-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: AUDIO-DESCRIPTION CHALLENGE:</h3>
<p>  Clive Lever of Maidstone in Kent, a long-time correspondent to our bulletin, was
 surprised to hear the BBC quiz programme University Challenge cited
 as a programme which is perceived by some as verbal and so not in
 need of audio-description (see story 13, section four, issue 51,
 March 2004).
</p>
<p> 
 "Even largely verbal quiz shows often have purely visual portions,"
 he said. "University Challenge has the pictorial round. The Channel Four
 programme Countdown has the conundrum at the end, whose letters
 are put up on screen. Viewers join in by trying to solve it, but
 listeners wait for the result. When they had a blind contestant on the
 programme
 it became fully accessible - for a week. When she left, it went back
 to its old ways.
</p>
<p> 
 "Perhaps there is a case for some programme makers to think about
 what information is being conveyed verbally. Take the news reporter
 who says: "The police have taken this and this, and turned them into
 this," using pictures to clarify the pronouns. Then take the reporter
 who says instead: "The police have taken this helmet and this camera and
 turned them into helmetcam". Suddenly there's less need for extra
 dialogue.
</p>
<p> 
 Referring to another part of the article which described the common
 practice of putting the audio-description track for programmes on a
 special channel which could only be picked up using wireless
 headphones, Clive said: "I also think it an insult and a frustration
 that
 the technology may assume that blind viewers would be isolated in the
 corner with their headphones, and that no sighted people would ever
 find audio description anything but an irritation.
</p>
<p> 
 "Surely there are times when sighted people follow their favourite TV
 programmes in 'eyes busy' situations. I'd have liked to have seen an
 audio-description that comes over the main speakers, but which can be
 switched on and off at will, but with the option of headphones if
 required." [Further responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i52-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: CIVIL PRECEDENT:</h3>
<p>  Harish Kotian writes in from India to ask if any of our readers have information about blind people working in
 the UK civil service. He says: "A friend of mine is denied
 appointment
 in the Indian civil services on reasons of his visual disability, so
 a precedent would be highly desirable, as we still adopt the British
 model."
 [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i52-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: HIT COMPILATION:</h3>
<p>  In our last issue, Karina Gregory asked if anyone knew of an accessible Java compiler. Tim Culhane of
 communications solutions provider Critical Path Ireland says: "I've
 heard that Eclipse (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</a>
) [an open source solution] is the most accessible." He adds that there is an email list dedicated
 to the
 discussion of java accessibility. "People on that list will be able
 to tell you which versions of what compilers work with different screen
 readers." To subscribe to the list readers should send a mail to
 <a href="mailto:LISTSERV@java.sun.com">LISTSERV@java.sun.com</a> with 'subscribe java-access' in the message body.
</p>
<p> 
 Karina also asked if anyone knew where to obtain a Braille font to
 translate on-screen text into Braille so that it can be printed out
 and transferred onto 'swell paper' to create readable Braille. She had
 been aware that the RNIB used to offer one but could no longer find it.
</p>
<p> 
 Stephen Bennett of the Visual Impairment Team at Leicester City
 Council's education department wrote in to say: "The RNIB Braille
 font is still available from the RNIB home page
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
)." Type Braille in the search box at the site,
 Bennett says, and from the list of links that is produced choose the
 one about six links down that is simply headed 'Braille' (not the one a
 little
 way above it headed 'Downloadable Braille Truetype Font'). You will
 then be offered the download as a zip file.

<p>

) sends in another useful link to Braille and sign language fonts from the Texas
 School for the Blind and Visually Impaired web site:

 .</p>
<h3 id="i52-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: MORE FONTS:</h3>
<p>  Contributions continue to arrive on the topic of readable fonts. John Taylor writes: "There is a font called Tiresias
 LP Font which is recommended by the RNIB [and] has been designed for
 people with eyesight problems. I personally have the eyesight
 condition Nystagmus and since finding this font I have changed my
 settings so it is my standard. I would highly recommend it for people
 who do want to make use of a clearly readable font.
</p>
<p> 
 "I believe this font is available from the RNIB or simply contact me
 and I will happily email you a copy." [Please contact John through
 <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<p> 
 And Vernon Webb of the Physical and Sensory Support Service at
 Herefordshire Council Education Directorate writes: "In the
 discussions about fonts in the last two issues of E-Access Bulletin I
 was surprised to see no mention of Verdana. I use it for my pupils
 (poor victims of my experiments!) because it distinguishes between
 numeric digit 1, lower case letter L and upper case letter i better
 than
 Arial. Also the characters are wider and more rounded. Finally, it is
 readily available in most Windows systems. Does anyone else use it,

SECTION THREE: FOCUS
- WEB RESEARCH.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Global Standards In The Spotlightby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 Results of the biggest ever programme of research into web
 accessibility are being unveiled today in the UK, revealing a range
 of important lessons for web developers worldwide.
</p>
<p> 
 Back in March 2003 the Disability Rights Commission for England,
 Scotland and Wales (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
) announced that its first formal investigation was to be into web site accessibility. It
 subsequently commissioned the Centre for Human Computer
 Interaction Design at City University, led by Professor Helen Petrie,
 to undertake research which was eventually to span some 39,000 web
 pages across 1,000 sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Professor Petrie's team selected around 200 sites to test in each of
 five
 main categories: government and information; business to business; e-
 commerce; leisure; and web services, such as internet service
 providers
 and search engines. They then oversaw a process which began with
 automated checks using the WebXM software tool from Watchfire
 (<a href="http://www.watchfire.com">http://www.watchfire.com</a>
) and, where these checks were passed, proceeded to task-based testing using groups of testers with
 disabilities using a range of assistive technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 The main external benchmarks used for the assessments were,
 unsurprisingly, the web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG)
 developed by the world wide web consortium's web accessibility
 initiative (www.w3c.org/WAI).
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines are divided into 'checkpoints' of levels 'A', 'AA' and
 'AAA' in order of increasing accessibility. It is generally
 considered
 that UK disability law now makes level 'A' conformance compulsory
 to avoid the risk of legal action, and UK government guidelines
 (<a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm</a>
) go further, stipulating that public sector web sites should attain at least partial 'AA'
 conformance.
</p>
<p> 
 The new research finds these targets are optimistic, to say the
 least.
 The team found that just 19 per cent of home pages passed on level
 'A' checks, and when it came to level 'AA', just two sites out of the
 1,000 (0.2 per cent) passed a series of automated and manual checks. No
 sites were found to reach 'AAA' compliance.
</p>
<p> 
 The research also threw up some anomalies with the WAI guidelines
 themselves. According to Petrie, only 55 per cent of usability
 problems
 reported by the testers were covered by any of the WCAG checkpoints,
 on the face of it an astonishing gap between real problems faced and
 those included in the main accepted international testing system.
</p>
<p> 
 And many of the WAI checks seemed redundant, as they were almost
 always passed - some of the manual checks, for example, are passed
 up to 95 per cent of the time.

 "This data could be used to refine WAI and make it more usable for
 people, because clearly web developers are struggling with WAI,"
 Petrie says. "But it also shows that WAI is not the be-all and
 end-all:
 people need to test their sites with real users."
</p>
<p> 
 The Director of the WAI, Judy Brewer, told E-Access Bulletin that
 many of the key accessibility problem types listed by the testers
 that are not covered by WCAG are covered by WAI's User Agent
 Accessibility Guidelines, which describe accessibility of browsers
 and media players and their interoperability with assistive technologies
 and are meant to be complementary to the content guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 And on the point that some checks seem barely worth including as they
 are passed by the great majority of sites, Brewer said: "WCAG
 includes checkpoints based on their priority for ensuring
 accessibility
 for people with disabilities, not on how frequently those checkpoints
 are already met on the average web site. [The guidelines are] already
 organised in three priority levels, so web developers can initially
 address a relatively small set of issues that have the greatest
 impact on barrier-reduction."
</p>
<p> 
 Although the DRC has decided not to name and shame any of the sites
 which were included in the tests and failed to reach basic
 accessibility
 standards, it has decided to name several of the sites which the
 panel of testers felt were the easiest to use.
</p>
<p> 
 These sites include the national online library catalogue Copac
 (<a href="http://www.copac.ac.uk">http://www.copac.ac.uk</a>
); online financial services group Egg (http://www.egg.com); the charity Oxfam (<a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk">http://www.oxfam.org.uk</a>
); the voluntary organisation Spinal Injuries Scotland
 (<a href="http://www.sisonline.org">http://www.sisonline.org</a>
); and the 'British dialect translator' comedy site Whoohoo (<a href="http://www.whoohoo.co.uk">http://www.whoohoo.co.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Petrie says this diverse grouping of sites demonstrates that all
 kinds of
 sites can be usable and accessible. The Spinal Injuries Scotland
 site, for
 example, shows you can create an accessible site on a small budget
 which is still lively and colourful; while at the other end of the
 budget
 scale, the Egg site shows that even the largest firms can embrace
 accessibility without compromising their corporate image or losing
 any elegance or sophistication from their e-services.
</p>
<p> 
 On average, testers found they could complete a set task successfully
 90 per cent of the time across the most usable sites. However, this
 exercise also contributed its own warning messages about over-
 reliance on WAI guidelines. For while these sites did tend to display
 fewer WAI checkpoint errors than most of the other sites tested, they
 were not the sites that returned the highest 10 scores against the
 WAI
 guidelines, and others with higher WAI ratings did not feature in the
 top 10 list.
</p>
<p> 
 However, Brewer said these findings too are not incompatible with
 WCAG, which "specifically address accessibility problems that create
 the most severe barriers for people with disabilities, not the broad
 spectrum of usability issues which affect all users.
</p>
<p> 
 "At the same time, WAI has always recognised the importance of
 incorporating user testing of accessibility features into a
 comprehensive evaluation of the accessibility of web sites; see for
 instance the WAI resource suite 'Evaluating web sites for
 accessibility'
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval">http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval</a>
)."</p>
<p> 
 WAI is currently working on version 2.0 of WCAG, Brewer said,
 which may also address any remaining concerns about version 1.0. "In
 WCAG 2.0 we are maintaining some division of priority levels, since
 this has proved so helpful to web designers. In addition, we expect
 that
 reorganisation and re-prioritisation will result in guidelines that
 are
 shorter, more easily implemented, and more easily tested, while
 addressing more advanced web technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 "In updating the WAI guidelines, WAI is taking into account feedback
 from the broad implementation experience of WCAG 1.0 around the
 world, as well as implementation of WAI guidelines for browsers and
 authoring tools. WAI . . . welcomes contributions such as the results
 of this research".
</p>
<p> 
 The new research clearly shows there is a long way to go before even
 low-level accessibility standards become the norm on the web.
 Developers everywhere will be hoping that the eventual emergence of
 WCAG 2.0 will meet their urgent need for a set of simpler, clearer
 guidelines to follow than is currently available.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: SEMINAR REPORT- ACCESSIBLE E-GOVERNMENT
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Democratising The Information Society.By Julie Hill.
</h3>
<p> 
 Government departments and local authorities should take a holistic
 approach to accessibility when planning the provision of online and
 other digital services. This was the message from a recent seminar
 hosted by E-Access Bulletin's sister publication E-Government
 Bulletin, 'E-Government for all: planning for accessibility'
 (<a href="http://www.electronic-government.com/access.htm">http://www.electronic-government.com/access.htm</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Instead of viewing accessibility as being simply about meeting the
 needs of disabled user groups, said experts, public bodies should
 broaden their thinking to include other groups whose access to online
 services might be impaired for a variety of reasons.
</p>
<p> 
 "Accessibility is usually promoted in terms of helping disabled users
 to use the web," said Tom Adams, senior digital media consultant at the
 UK government's technology policy agency the Office of the e-Envoy
 (<a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 "But this is only part of the picture. Accessibility should be
 considered
 as enabling web use for anyone with a web limiting condition, which
 could arise as much from a disability as from technical or
 environmental limitations." For example, Adams said that accessible
 services also benefit those using older computer equipment, unusual
 browsers or those with slow internet connections.
</p>
<p> 
 Such a wide view of accessibility is particularly crucial when it
 comes
 to providing public services, because government has an obligation to
 cater for all of its citizens. "While commercial service providers
 can target particular sectors, local authorities, for example, have a
 duty to
 meet the needs of all their residents," said Guido Gybels, director
 of new technologies at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People
 (<a href="http://www.rnid.org.uk">http://www.rnid.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 But government bodies need to factor accessibility into their service
 design from the outset, said Adams. Accessibility need not be only
 difficult and expensive to achieve, he said, but it will be if it is
 not planned into projects from the beginning and organisations find
 themselves having to 'retrofit' their web sites. It is therefore
 important
 to ensure not only that accessibility requirements are well
 understood
 but that they are seen as an ongoing priority and are an integral
 part of
 a service's evaluation, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 There was consensus about the lack of skills not only among
 government commissioning bodies to make judgments about
 accessibility, but also among the web developer community. Many
 public sector web developers "don't know how to do accessibility and
 they have never met a disabled user," said Adams. This lack of
 knowledge is not being addressed by the IT education sector, he said,
 which appears to be failing to build in accessibility techniques into
 its training programmes. Adam cited the example of his son who is
 currently doing a degree in multimedia at a London university. He
 said that the focus of the course is on creating animated graphics and
 accessible web design does not figure at all in the curriculum. When
 he offered to go along and talk to the students about accessibility,
 they turned him down.
</p>
<p> 
 So what factors need to be addressed in order to ensure truly
 inclusive
 e-government services? The RNID's Gybels outlined three things:
 raising awareness of the need for accessibility among public service
 providers and web developers; creating a dialogue with user
 representatives to feed this awareness; and bringing inclusive design
 into the mainstream, so that just as security and interoperability are
 considered when developing e-government services, so accessibility is
 also a key prerequisite.
</p>
<p> 
 The potential prize is huge, said Gybels. "The biggest challenge
 facing
 e-government - but also the biggest benefit it can bring - is to
 transform the information society into a truly inclusive society, one
 in which everyone can participate fully as citizens and realise their
 potential," he said.
