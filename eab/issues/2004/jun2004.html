<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SPECIAL NOTICE: Sight Village 2004- 13-15 July, Birmingham, UK.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 Around 3,000 people are expected to visit this year's QAC Sight
 Village, the exhibition for everyone with an interest in technology and
 services connected to visual impairment. Exhibitors and visitors come
 from throughout the UK, America, Canada, Europe, the Middle East
 and Africa. Smaller organisations of or for people with visual
 impairment are particularly welcomed as exhibitors alongside the 'big
 players'.
</p>
<p> 
 This year the event has moved to a larger venue: the Clarendon Suites,
 a conference centre near to the exhibition's host Queen Alexandra
 College. All areas of the venue are accessible for wheelchairs, and
 admission is free. See:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i54-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Europe Launches Major Access Programme.</h3>
<p> 
 The European Commission has launched a major new programme of
 research into accessibility policies across EU member states, paving
 the way for a set of accessibility guidelines to improve access to digital
 services and technologies for disabled users across the continent.
</p>
<p> 
 The <a href="mailto:eInclusion@eu">eInclusion@eu</a> project (http://www.einclusion-eu.org/) will examine national and regional policies on access to employment,
 public sector technology procurement, and access to online public
 services such as e-government, e-health and e-learning. As part of its
 work the 30-month project aims to build an EU-wide picture of
 accessibility requirements for government web sites, including which
 accessibility standards are used, if compliance is voluntary or
 mandatory, and whether feedback from users is collected and acted on.
</p>
<p> 
 Lutz Kubitschke of German consultancy Empirica
 (<a href="http://www.empirica.com/">http://www.empirica.com/</a>
), which is co-ordinating the research, told E-Access Bulletin: "It is important to get a structured view of what is
 going on out there. It's no good if guidelines are issued in Brussels, but
 they are not practical for member states to implement." It is hoped that
 by the end of the year, the Commission will use the research to issue
 draft guidelines on public procurement, Kubitschke said.
</p>
<p> 
 The findings should also uncover valuable information such as
 problems with implementing international web accessibility standards.
 "In some cases it may be that the expertise needed to translate
 guidelines such as WAI (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
) into procedures is missing, or that not enough money, time and resources are made
 available for accessible web design," said Kubitschke. The
 <a href="mailto:eInclusion@eu">eInclusion@eu</a> project is being driven by a core of research teams in eight member states, and is funded through the EU's 17.5 billion euro
 Sixth Framework research programme
 (<a href="http://fp6.cordis.lu/fp6/home.cfm">http://fp6.cordis.lu/fp6/home.cfm</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i54-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Banks Named And Shamed Over Card Problems.</h3>
<p> 
 UK banks who fared poorly in a 'mystery shopping' exercise to test the
 accessibility of new-style credit and debit cards are to be "named and
 shamed" by the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The cards tested use a new so-called 'Chip and PIN' system designed
 to combat fraud by requiring users to key in a security PIN number
 whenever a purchase is made. Banks are supposed to offer and explain
 an alternative to Chip and PIN called 'Chip and signature', which is
 easier for some people with impaired vision since they may find
 keypads hard to use. However, the survey found that many were not
 doing so.
</p>
<p> 
 Results of the mystery shopping experiment will be published towards
 the end of August and will include full details of which card issuers
 were contacted along with a breakdown of the results.
</p>
<p> 
 When a pool of vision-impaired 'mystery shoppers'
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsit">http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/publicwebsit</a>

 e/public_mysteryshopping.hcsp) initially contacted the call centres of
 fifteen banks, building societies and credit card companies to ask for
 advice on the accessible alternative, just 22 callers out of the total 67
 calls made (33 per cent) were told about the alternative and 15 call
 centre employees (22 per cent) mentioned that customers could
 continue to sign but either gave incorrect information about the chip
 and signature card or knew nothing about it.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB campaigns team is currently working with banks to improve
 services, for example leading staff through practical issues such as how
 call centre staff can identify when to issue a chip and signature card.
 The RNIB has also suggested banks improve information on their
 intranets and external information on their web sites. "Internal
 communication is the issue," says Helen Dearman, campaigns officer
 at RNIB. Dearman says she has already noticed a reduction in the
 amount of calls to the RNIB from people complaining about their
 banks over this issue, although she adds that a high staff turnover in
 bank call centres is likely to hamper progress when the mystery
 shopper exercise is repeated in August
</p>
<h3 id="i54-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Guidelines For Local Government Chiefs.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB has published guidelines for senior managers and policy-
 makers in local government on how to make new technologies, from
 smart cards to tactile displays, more usable by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Written by Dr John Gill, chief scientist at the RNIB, the 'Access-
 Ability' booklet (<a href="http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/access-ability/">http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/access-ability/</a>
) provides an overview of design considerations to be taken into account
 when developing new services. From transport and financial
 transactions to telecommunications and computing, the publication
 outlines common problems experienced by the elderly and disabled
 and offers suggestions for addressing them.
</p>
<p> 
 "The booklet is targeted at senior managers who aren't specialists in
 technology and don't have in-depth knowledge of disability," says Gill.
 The guidelines were produced as part of the RNIB's collaboration with
 the National Smartcard Project
 (<a href="http://www.nationalsmartcardproject.org.uk/">http://www.nationalsmartcardproject.org.uk/</a>
), one of 22 national projects commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to
 aid local authorities on the road to e-government
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nat1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nat1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The collaboration identified three target audiences who needed more
 information about accessibility: senior managers and policy-makers in
 local government; project leaders responsible for implementing local e-
 government projects; and hardware and software designers who may or
 may not work for local government.
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines were developed in collaboration with Comit&#233; Europ&#233;en
 de Normalisation (CEN - <a href="http://www.cenorm.be/">http://www.cenorm.be/</a>
), the European technology standards body.
</p>
<h3 id="i54-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Council Trio Claim 'Aaa' Rating.</h3>
<p> 
 Three UK local authorities now claim to have web sites which comply
 with the highest standard of accessibility under the World Wide Web
 Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
), known as 'AAA' accessibility. One expert has questioned whether full 'AAA' compliance has indeed been
 achieved by these sites, although their intention to move towards full
 accessibility was welcomed.
</p>
<p> 
 Haringey (<a href="http://www.haringey.gov.uk/">http://www.haringey.gov.uk/</a>
) in London, Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (<a href="http://www.stockport.gov.uk/">http://www.stockport.gov.uk/</a>
) and Tameside Council (<a href="http://www.tameside.gov.uk/">http://www.tameside.gov.uk/</a>
) in Greater Manchester have all recently relaunched sites that they say now
 provide easy access to all visitors, regardless of ability.
</p>
<p> 
 Under a central government directive, all public bodies are required to
 meet the lower 'AA' standard of accessibility by the end of 2005.
</p>
<p> 
 Stockport relaunched its site at the end of May, improving its
 accessibility rating from 'A' to 'AAA' standard. It uses an 'off-the-
 shelf' solution from Mediasurface (<a href="http://www.mediasurface.com/">http://www.mediasurface.com/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Haringey's site was launched in March, using an accessible templated
 design integrated into a content management system. This means that
 editors enter content using templates with built-in accessibility checks.
 For example, they can't enter an image onto the site without including
 a textual description which can be read by a blind or visually impaired
 person using screen reader technology. Haringey also consulted a
 range of users, including those with visual impairments, throughout the
 design and build process.
</p>
<p> 
 Tameside unveiled its AAA site in December 2003, following
 consultation with the RNIB and other relevant bodies.
</p>
<p> 
 Helen Petrie, professor of human computer interaction at City
 University (<a href="http://www-hcid.soi.city.ac.uk/">http://www-hcid.soi.city.ac.uk/</a>
) and a leading accessibility researcher, says the efforts among local authorities to reach the AAA
 standard are highly commendable. However, she says some aspects of
 full 'AAA' compliance are complex, and the three council sites appear
 to fall short of full 'AAA' compliance. And she says compliance with
 standards alone isn't enough to create good web sites. "For example,
 the standards say you should provide clear and consistent navigation.
 But to achieve this, you need a good understanding of how a range of
 users find their way around web sites. This means you need to conduct
 user testing. Only by combining compliance with standards and
 guidelines with user testing - among the disabled and non-disabled -
 will organisations create truly accessible and usable web sites."

<h3 id="i54-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: RADIO OBJECTIONS:</h3>
<p>  Matt King, Accessibility End User Advocate with IBM Business Transformation, writes in with strong
 personal objections to some of the remarks made by Kevin Carey in his
 article 'Radio presenters have more fun' (see E-Access Bulletin, May
 2004) which suggested that the job opportunities opened up by internet
 radio stations could be more attractive and accessible to blind people
 than traditional computer programming work.
</p>
<p> 
 "I strongly believe the conclusions Kevin Carey drew from the recent
 Disability Rights Commission research on web accessibility and
 conveyed in his article are invalid, irresponsible, and damaging," King
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 "Because blind participants in the study had more trouble completing
 tasks or working efficiently even on well-designed web sites, Kevin
 claimed that it is reasonable to conclude, 'although blind people will
 need IT skills for education, employment and leisure - as means to an
 end - they will rarely be good enough in overcoming systems design
 problems to secure employment in IT per se. The days when the words
 'blind' and 'computer programmer' went together like Morecambe and
 Wise were brief and are long gone.'"
</p>
<p> 
 King continues: "The DRC study was focused on the web sites, not the
 abilities or aptitudes of the participants. It is not logical or valid to
 conclude that if the average blind person has trouble using the average
 or even better than average web site, that blind people are
 proportionately less likely to be able to develop skills that will result in
 success in an IT-related field. Even if the vast majority of IT jobs
 consisted of using web applications more than 50 per cent of the time
 on the job, such a conclusion would still be completely baseless.
</p>
<p> 
 "IT-related fields continue to be an excellent choice for any blind
 person with the appropriate aptitudes. And, as the accessibility of
 advanced development tools improves, the doors open still wider.
 True, not all blind people have the nature to be equally good at
 presenting radio programs and developing, supporting, or managing
 computer-related technologies. Thus, each to his own. However, it is a
 mistake to diminish the fitness for consideration of one over the other
 purely based on visual acuity. I think it would be tragic if Kevin's
 article dampened the spirits of any blind individual who aspires to
 become an IT professional. And, on average, I would be shocked if
 working in radio pays as well. There is no doubt that radio is a smaller
 and less diverse field." [Further comments please to

SECTION THREE: FOCUS
- DISCUSSION LISTS.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Chain Reactionby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 Email discussions groups have long served as a convenient, accessible
 tool for like-minded people to exchange ideas and advice on almost
 any topic, including the use of special access technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 One such resource is the low vision computer access discussion list, or
 Magnifiers group, a dynamic group started by Peter Verhoeven. The
 list is an offshoot of a web site entitled 'The Screen Magnifiers
 homepage' (<a href="http://www.magnifiers.org/">http://www.magnifiers.org/</a>
), from the non-profit independent organisation of the same name.
</p>
<p> 
 As with most such lists, subscribers send an email to a single address,
 and the posting can be viewed by all other members. It provides a
 convenient forum for professionals, manufacturers, distributors, vision-
 impaired users and potential buyers of assistive technologies to support
 and advise one another in the use of access products.
</p>
<p> 
 List members offer tips on and reviews of existing and new assistive
 technologies; tip-offs on good deals; problems found; and request
 tricks on how to overcome difficulties or simply share experiences.
</p>
<p> 
 Many subscribers also post basic product reviews and
 recommendations as well as more in-depth analysis of product
 features. For example, a member may ask the list whether they think
 there are too many menus in the main window of the screen magnifier
 ZoomText (<a href="http://www.aisquared.com/">http://www.aisquared.com/</a>
), or which hand-held portable magnifier they think is most efficient.
</p>
<p> 
 For Tom Whittle, product range manager of technology products at the
 RNIB, lists such as these - and there is at least one for every major
 product on the market - provide a means of flagging up important user
 issues that may remain undiscovered from the confines of his office. "I
 like flicking through them and seeing the problems people have," he
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 The potential of this simple way of communicating is wide: not only
 do such lists provide a place to share information and smooth out
 niggling mundane user problems; potentially, archived postings can act
 as a huge resource of market research for access technology companies
 who could use it to vastly improve their access products. "Email lists
 are a good way of getting customer feedback to the manufacturer - if
 manufacturers have any sense, they'll monitor," Whittle says.
</p>
<p> 
 Discussion lists can also be a way for manufacturers and others to put
 the record straight on rumours or malicious attacks, he says. "I
 contribute when I see something not true."
</p>
<p> 
 Some assistive technology companies actively develop and support
 their own user discussion lists. For example GW Micro, the company
 behind screen reader Window-Eyes, offers multi-lingual discussion
 lists, information discussion lists and newslists
 (<a href="http://www.gwmicro.com/support">http://www.gwmicro.com/support</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, such 'self-help' support options may even bring down
 product costs, Whittle says. "When you look at software access
 products, the main cost is support," he says. When buying or
 developing software for example, the initial costs may be outweighed
 by the ongoing costs of support, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 "The more complicated the product, the more support is needed,"
 Whittle says. "It's a good idea to have as many [means of supporting
 customers] as possible. I've used them myself when I am a novice at
 certain products," says Whittle, who regularly tests new assistive
 technologies in his job.
</p>
<p> 
 In some cases, manufacturers are using discussion lists directly to
 improve their products. One such company is Plextor
 (<a href="http://www.plextalk.com/europe">http://www.plextalk.com/europe</a>
), a leading US developer and manufacturer of CD-related equipment and software which researches
 and engineers products for digital talking book players.
</p>
<p> 
 Their recording e-book player, the Plextalk portable recorder 'PTR1'
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/plex1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/plex1</a>
) has its own email list, (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/plex2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/plex2</a>
) started out of a high demand from users for discussing features of this potentially complicated product.
 "These guys are good at taking tips from people - they've got a good
 development team," Whittle says.
</p>
<p> 
 However, Whittle does offer a caution: "People in groups have
 different agendas," he says. Some people may use the forum to market
 their own products for example. As with all information retrieved from
 the internet, it is important to check the facts, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 "I look at the Magnifiers list to see how people are coping with the
 technology that's there," says Colin Holloway, owner of assistive
 technology company New Vision, and a regular contributor. "It upsets
 a lot of manufacturers but I like that honesty."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: ANALYSIS- WEB ACCESSIBILITY.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: The Hard Road To Progressby Julie Hill
</h3>
<p> 
 In April this year, the Disability Rights Commission (<a href="http://www.drc/-gb.org">http://www.drc/-gb.org</a>
) published the findings of the largest ever research project into
 web accessibility (see E-Government Bulletin, issue 159, 16 April
 2004). Its conclusions make pretty depressing reading: only 19 per cent
 of a sample of 1,000 UK sites meet even the minimum standard for
 disabled web access under the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
) guidelines. There is also a distinct lack of awareness among web site owners and
 designers about accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 However, despite the disappointing picture of web accessibility painted
 in the report, there are organisations making significant efforts to
 ensure their online services are accessible to all.
</p>
<p> 
 Laura van Weyenbergh is e-communications officer at Rushcliffe
 Borough Council (<a href="http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk/">http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk/</a>
), which launched its accessibility initiative in 2001. At that time, awareness of web
 accessibility issues was fairly low, she says. "Our original site was
 designed in the late nineties, when web accessibility issues simply
 weren't being discussed outside specialist organisations," says van
 Weyenbergh. "While it was expected that public buildings must have
 wheelchair access and induction loops for people with hearing aids, it
 was neither known nor understood how people with vision and motor
 impairments might use a web site."
</p>
<p> 
 A combination of legislative pressures and feedback from citizens who
 couldn't access the council's site compelled Rushcliffe into action. It
 formed a dedicated communications team to deal with web
 accessibility in 2001 and is now working towards AA compliance with
 the WAI guidelines, which it hopes to achieve by the end of this year.
 Indeed, like other public bodies, the council had to commit to AA
 compliance by 2005 as part of its Implementing E-Government (IEG)
 statement to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister this year.
</p>
<p> 
 At Rushcliffe, the formation of the communications department was a
 catalyst for change, although the council recognises that accessibility is
 an ongoing challenge that requires new mindsets and new ways of
 working. "It is crucial to do the groundwork to ensure that web site
 contributors understand their role in accessibility," she says. "We have
 tried to encourage staff to view accessibility as the norm rather than
 extra work, but admittedly this has been difficult." There are always
 instances of where content needs to be added immediately and this is
 difficult to plan for, she says. "In these instances, we try to add a more
 accessible version of information as soon as is practicable," van
 Weyenbergh says.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the other challenges for Rushcliffe was its relationship with
 suppliers. When it first launched its initiative, few suppliers knew
 about web accessibility. "But we didn't come across any that weren't
 willing to have a go," van Weyenbergh says. "The knowledge of
 suppliers has improved considerably since then, although we do still
 come across one or two who aren't familiar with accessibility."
</p>
<p> 
 The imperative towards web accessibility for commercial organisations
 is perhaps less clear-cut. Centrica (<a href="http://www.centrica.co.uk/">http://www.centrica.co.uk/</a>
), a conglomerate whose brands include the AA (<a href="http://www.theaa.com/">http://www.theaa.com/</a>
), British Gas (<a href="http://www.house.co.uk/">http://www.house.co.uk/</a>
) and One.Tel (<a href="http://www.onetel.co.uk/">http://www.onetel.co.uk/</a>
), is among a minority of corporates who have taken this issue seriously. Since 1999, it has been working towards
 making sure all its sites are accessible to all its customers. The impetus
 came from a commitment by senior management to embrace the
 Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which requires all organisations to
 ensure that their services, including web sites, are equally accessible to
 disabled people. However, there was a broader perspective to the
 company's thinking. "The commercial logic was clear," says James
 Donnan, corporate brand manager at Centrica. "Investing time and
 money to create effective and usable web sites would deliver a payback
 by generating customer loyalty and more return visits - and would
 ultimately lead to more business."
</p>
<p> 
 Both van Weyenbergh and Donnan agree that it is crucial to set up
 formal structures and to get people's buy-in to make accessibility
 initiatives successful. Centrica pooled expertise from across the
 organisation by setting up a web accessibility group, consisting of
 representatives from its main web sites. The group sought to interpret
 the WAI guidelines in practical terms that could be understood by web
 development teams and sought advice from external experts, such as
 the charity AbilityNet (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/</a>
). "It is important to get all the right people together at the outset and to gain a clear
 understanding of what the accessibility guidelines mean in real terms
 for your site," Donnan says. "You then need to raise awareness about
 accessibility across the business, so that you get everyone's buy-in to
 what you are doing."
</p>
<p> 
 Neither Rushcliffe nor Centrica feel that they have had to compromise
 creativity in creating accessible web sites. "Some people think that
 accessible sites are dull and worthy, but we don't think so," says
 Donnan. "With centrica.com, we have used prominent imagery and
 created an attractive environment for the user which is still accessible.
 Once our programmers and designers understood the parameters they
 had to work in, they saw it as a challenge to see how creative they
 could be."
</p>
<p> 
 Nor have accessible web sites necessarily created extra cost for
 Centrica - another common misconception among commercial
 organisations, in particular. All new developments are built with
 accessibility in mind from the start and the company has found that the
 cost of programming and development is much the same. And for
 existing sites, the company has made improvements as part of phased
 site updates. "If you plan your site development so that accessibility
 improvements can be incorporated along with other work, then it may
 not necessarily create greater expense," says Donnan. "It has really
 helped to take a long-term view, as accessibility has now become
 second nature to our web teams."
</p>
<p> 
 Taking web accessibility on board has resulted in a better online
 experience all round, says van Weyenbergh. "Once you start to look at
 creating an accessible web page, you are forced to confront issues,
 such as usability, the importance of well-written content and
 consistency," she says. "This benefits everyone who visits your site."
