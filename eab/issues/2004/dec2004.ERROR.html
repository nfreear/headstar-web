<h3 id="i60-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Adobe Moves To Tackle Pdf Access Problems.</h3>
<p>  
 Adobe Systems has moved to address severe accessibility problems 
 posed by its 'portable document format' (pdf) files, with the release 
 this month of a new version of software to create and read the files.
</p>
<p>  
 The pdf system is a largely graphical way of exchanging and printing 
 files, which has often rendered plain text information inaccessible.
</p>
<p>  
 The new version of Adobe's Acrobat software which creates pdf files 
 and Reader software which reads them - version 7.0 - contains several 
 new access features. File publishers will find it easier to add 'tags' to 
 text, tables and graphical objects, to establish a reading order for files 
 in complex layouts. And even if the publishers do not create tags, the 
 new version of Reader will try to determine a logical reading order and 
 reflow the text into a single block.
</p>
<p>  
 The new version of Reader also contains an accessibility set-up 
 assistant, which detects if a screen-reader being used and asks how the 
 user would like to view the files. Other features include better tagging 
 of the software's own graphical buttons; and improved help and search 
 functions.
</p>
<p>  
 "In the past, pdf was deemed to be inherently inaccessible," says Greg 
 Pisocky, accessibility outreach manager at Adobe Systems. "Now 
 we've introduced something that at least makes it easier to modify how 
 information is presented. Things are not perfect in Adobe 7.0. Tables 
 continue to be the bane of our lives. But we've moved forward."
</p>
<p>  
 Pisocky unveiled the new features at last month's Techshare 
 conference hosted by RNIB (<a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
). However,  some delegates voiced ongoing concerns about certain security features 
 of pdf files, which in the process of preventing unauthorised copying 
 of files, may lock out some screen-reader users.
</p>
<p>  
 Steve Tyler, Policy and ICT Access Manager at the RNIB, told 
 delegates the existence of a feature which can exclude some screen-
 readers could contravene European copyright law which champions 
 accessibility.
</p>
<p>  
 However, Pisocky said the new software did allow 'trusted agent' 
 software to access files whatever the security settings. To date, the 
 JAWS and WINDOW-EYES screen-readers were the only two to have 
 been granted trusted status, but Adobe was open to approaches from 
 other providers, he said.
</p>
<h3 id="i60-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Call For National Taskforce To Boost Access To Reading.</h3>
<p>  
 The RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
) is urging the UK government to  set up a taskforce with blindness charities and publishers to develop a 
 national plan for making more ordinary books and reading materials 
 accessible to those with sight problems. The government also needs to 
 fund new research into the field, the institute says.
</p>
<p>  
 A recent RNIB report, 'Written Off!', found that some 96 per cent of 
 books are never published in formats that people with sight problems 
 can read, such as large print, audio or Braille, and that as a result some 
 three million people in the UK are being denied the right to read.
</p>
<p>  
 Digital methods have a lot of potential for integrating mainstream 
 publishing with formats that are accessible to blind and visually 
 impaired people, the report says. 
</p>
<p>  
 "In the past, organisations such as the RNIB worked from a paper copy 
 of a book to make a voice recording or to scan or key in text to a PC," 
 says David Mann, author of the report and RNIB spokesperson for the 
 institute's ongoing 'Right to Read' campaign 
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/righttoread">http://www.rnib.org.uk/righttoread</a>
). "This was very time-consuming  and didn't start until after publication. If publishers could provide us 
 with content prior to publication and in digital form, it would cut out 
 this process. Digital technology also allows different outputs from the 
 same 'master', and for the user, formats such as DAISY offer much 
 more flexibility to index and bookmark content, for example."
</p>
<p>  
 The report criticises the UK government for "side-stepping" the issue 
 of funding for accessible format production and says that it is 
 unreasonable to expect charities to continue to take responsibility for 
 producing the bulk of audio and Braille titles.
</p>
<p>  
 "Charities should not have to subsidise reading for blind people, nor 
 can they hope to meet all reading needs from their current resources," 
 says Mann. "Publishers can't be expected to operate at a loss. So we 
 need substantial and reliable streams of public money to increase our 
 storage and production capacity and to set up new working 
 arrangements with publishers."
</p>
<p>  
 The report found that just 2.8 per cent of books are currently made 
 available on standard audio cassette, with even fewer in other audio 
 formats; 1.5 per cent of titles were available in large print; and 1.9 per 
 cent of publications were available in Braille. Such alternative formats 
 were also often considerably more expensive than traditional books. 
 For example, a full-length audio book might cost over 50 pounds, 
 while the equivalent paperback would cost less than 10 pounds.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Management Tool For Disability Practice Is 'World'S First.'</h3>
<p>  
 What is claimed to be the world's first management tool for assessing 
 organisations' performance on disability has been launched by a UK 
 business body, the Employers' Forum on Disability 
 (<a href="http://www.employers-forum.co.uk/">http://www.employers-forum.co.uk/</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 The Disability Standard allows private and public sector organisations 
 to measure their progress on disability across all areas of their business 
 and put in place plans for improvement. Its main component is a 100-
 question benchmark survey, covering a whole range of areas such as 
 employment, e-commerce, customer care, IT systems and buildings.
</p>
<p>  
 The service will cost organisations from 2,000 to 8,900 pounds, 
 depending on number of employees. Once the benchmark survey is 
 completed, it is then scored by the University of Brighton and 
 submitted to an independent panel of disability experts, which 
 produces a report outlining current risks, areas for improvement and 
 required actions.
</p>
<p>  
 Some 15 questions relate to the accessibility of IT systems to staff and 
 customers. For example, there are questions about whether 
 organisations devote money and resources to making their internal IT 
 systems accessible to staff and their web sites accessible to disabled 
 customers; and whether reports and accounts are available in accessible 
 electronic formats. The survey is supported by an accompanying guide 
 which sets out relevant legislation and codes of practice, and 
 organisations are required to submit evidence to support their answers.
</p>
<p>  
 "Information technology is an important part of the Disability 
 Standard, because it is so embedded in the way organisations are run 
 and is crucial to how they perform on disability," says Aletheia Gentle, 
 project manager for the Disability Standard at the Employers' Forum 
 on Disability. "It fundamentally affects how they reach customers, staff 
 members and other stakeholders."
</p>
<p>  
 The Disability Standard was researched and piloted by 15 members of 
 the forum, including the bank Abbey, telecoms company Cable & 
 Wireless, Royal Mail, the Department for Work and Pensions and the 
 Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Twenty-two organisations have 
 signed up to the service and have eight weeks from the beginning of 
 February to the end of March 2005 to complete the benchmarking 
 exercise.
</p>
<h3 id="i60-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Winter Glut Of Web Access Awards.</h3>
<p>  
 Three sets of major awards for accessible web sites were bestowed last 
 week.
</p>
<p>  
 The annual Visionary Design Awards from the National Library for the 
 Blind (NLB - www.nlb-online.org), supported by Barclays Bank, 
 recognised eight sites out of 100 nominees. They were AbilityNet 
 (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk</a>
), charity technology supplier for disabled  people for the voluntary sector; the web site of children's writer Anne 
 Fine (<a href="http://www.annefine.co.uk">http://www.annefine.co.uk</a>
); global insurer Aviva  (<a href="http://www.aviva.com">http://www.aviva.com</a>
); the Disability Rights Commission  (<a href="http://www.drc.org.uk">http://www.drc.org.uk</a>
); Henshaws Society for Blind People  (<a href="http://www.henshaws.org.uk">http://www.henshaws.org.uk</a>
), a charity from the North of England;  Motability (<a href="http://www.motability.co.uk">http://www.motability.co.uk</a>
), a car scheme for people with  a disability; Philip Murphy and Associates 
 (<a href="http://www.philipmurphyassociates.com">http://www.philipmurphyassociates.com</a>
), a family dental practice;  and the Transport Archive (<a href="http://www.transportarchive.org.uk">http://www.transportarchive.org.uk</a>
), a site  covering British transport history. 
</p>
<p>  
 Meanwhile, Haringey council's web site (<a href="http://www.haringey.gov.uk">http://www.haringey.gov.uk</a>
)  has been picked as November's accessible site of the month - the first 
 in a new series of awards by the Guild of Accessible Web Designers 
 (GAWD - <a href="http://www.gawds.org">http://www.gawds.org</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 "Because we worked with a specialist web accessibility agency, it 
 helped us ensure the site was technically structured to work with a 
 range of assistive devices," said Maria Stewart, web development 
 manager at Haringey. Residents, including those with a vision 
 impairment, were asked to test the site and submit their ideas.
</p>
<p>  
 GAWD is now taking nominations for December's site of the month - 
 anyone can register a vote (see 
 <a href="http://www.gawds.org/poll/index.php?poll=4">http://www.gawds.org/poll/index.php?poll=4</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 Finally, the Cancer Research web site 
 (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org</a>
) came first in the accessibility and  usability category of last month's British Interactive Media Awards 
 (BIMA - <a href="http://www.bima.co.uk">http://www.bima.co.uk</a>
). Second and third places went to the  business support group Business Link 
 (<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">http://www.businesslink.gov.uk</a>
) and Imperial Tobacco  (<a href="http://www.imperial-tobacco.com/">http://www.imperial-tobacco.com/</a>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Interview- Judy Brewer.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Guardian Of The Global Access Standardby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p>  
 "In an area where the pace of technology is so rapid, lost ground is not 
 easily made up. We need a continuation of the good work of 
 organisations involved in developing web solutions, so that the web 
 can move forward as a technology that serves all."
</p>
<p>  
 These were the words of web accessibility pioneer Judy Brewer, as she 
 presented the case for increasing the accessibility of all web sites to a 
 US House of Representatives' sub-committee on the Constitution.
</p>
<p>  
 That was back in 2000, but her words are just as relevant today. 
 Brewer is director of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI - 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
), one of four main work areas of the global  World Wide Web Consortium, a grouping of several hundred 
 organisations across the world which upholds the standards of the web.
</p>
<p>  
 At WAI, Brewer's remit includes ensuring technologies support 
 accessibility; developing accessibility guidelines; improving tools for 
 evaluation and repair of web sites; conducting education and outreach 
 on web accessibility; and monitoring research and development which 
 may impact future accessibility of the web. But she also oversees 
 development of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG - 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT</a>
), the benchmarks used  to measure the accessibility of web sites against a series of checkpoints 
 grouped in three priority levels: 'A,' 'AA' and 'AAA' 
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Conformance">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Conformance</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 The guidelines were first released in 1999. Now, web developers and 
 disability organisations are waiting with bated breath for the release of 
 WCAG version 2.0 - the first ever major overhaul of the guidelines - a 
 draft of which is currently under development for release during 2005 
 (for a current working draft, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 What will the major changes be compared with WCAG 1.0? "One of 
 the biggest changes is to ensure more precise testing criteria," said 
 Brewer, speaking to E-Access Bulletin after delivering the keynote 
 address to the RNIB's Techshare conference in Birmingham last 
 month. "The question of evaluation is interesting from many 
 perspectives. When WCAG 1.0 came out we had less robust testing 
 requirements for the guidelines. In some cases it's not clear how to test 
 for a given checkpoint," she said.
</p>
<p>  
 However, she warned against over-reliance on automated software 
 checks for accessibility, either now or in the future. . "Most people will 
 say 'I passed the majority of tests - I'm going to slap a logo on my 
 site.' That doesn't reflect how well it will work for people with a 
 disability," Brewer said. "By and large automated testing tools can 
 help with the evaluation of large web sites but they may miss an 
 accessibility barrier. Experts use multiple tools," she said. "With 
 WCAG 2.0 we're expecting that more precise testing criteria will fuel 
 development of a more precise set of tools."
</p>
<p>  
 She also said that the working group is focusing more on access issues 
 for people with cognitive difficulties. "Cognitive difficulties have been 
 important to home in on - we expect that support for these will 
 improve," Brewer said.
</p>
<p>  
 Brewer says that there are advantages in using a common set of 
 W3C/WAI guidelines in any country that is developing a web 
 accessibility policy. "There is still a tendency in some countries to say 
 'web accessibility is great, let's develop our own guidelines.' 
 Disabilities are similar in different countries so you need the same 
 functionality - standards harmonisation benefits everybody," Brewer 
 said.
</p>
<p>  
 The WCAG system has been at the centre of controversy in the UK 
 recently after this year's on the findings of what was claimed to be the 
 largest ever investigation into web site accessibility by the Disability 
 Rights Commission (DRC - <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
). The survey  involved the testing of 1,000 UK sites by researchers at City 
 University, London.
</p>
<p>  
 While the report found that WCAG improved usability, it said the 
 guidelines were overly complex, and suggested that there were many 
 barriers to accessibility which were not yet covered by WAI 
 guidelines. "We've gone backwards and forwards through the available 
 data for that survey," Brewer said. "We found that almost all (95 per 
 cent) of barriers noted in the survey were covered by WAI guidelines -
 - the great majority by WCAG, and the rest by the User Agent 
 Accessibility Guidelines, which address browser accessibility."
</p>
<p>  
 Brewer also noted that only a very small number of sites in the survey 
 actually conformed to WCAG, so it is difficult to draw conclusions 
 about the usability of WCAG-conformant sites for people with 
 disabilities from this survey. "This raises another interesting policy 
 question - why are so few sites in the UK accessible for people with 
 disabilities, and what would change that?"

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Funding The Basics Of Modern Lifeby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p>  
 Many ordinary people with sight problems do not have high incomes, 
 and lack access to grants for computer equipment and special access 
 technologies such as screen readers that might enhance their lives in 
 many ways.
</p>
<p>  
 If someone needs to use technology for their work, there are usually 
 ways of funding it. And if someone has a particular interest in 
 computers, they usually find a way too. But for people with no special 
 interest or knowledge, and no pressing need to access computers for 
 work or other reasons, it can be hard to fund access to what for most 
 people is nevertheless a basic part of modern life: a simple home 
 computer, with access to email, the web, and word processing.
</p>
<p>  
 A typical cost for a standard accessible home computing set-up for a 
 blind person is in the region of some 2,600 pounds, according to a 
 detailed estimate presented by RNIB officers to last month's Techshare 
 conference (<a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 Mary Steiner, RNIB Technology Officer, said this cost includes a PC 
 (personal computer); a printer; Microsoft Officer software for word 
 processing and other basic tasks; special access software such as a 
 screen reader to convert text into speech or Braille; and a scanner with 
 scanning software to allow users to scan and digitise text using 'optical 
 character recognition' (OCR).
</p>
<p>  
 For low vision users the cost is lower, as they may simply need screen 
 magnifying software instead of a screen reader and scanning 
 equipment, but will still end up in the region of 1,325 pounds, Steiner 
 said.
</p>
<p>  
 But need costs really be this high? Over the course of the session, 
 Steiner and her colleague Richard Orme, RNIB Assistant Director for 
 ICT Services, looked at each component of these accessible systems in 
 turn to see how costs could be minimised or even driven out 
 completely, resulting in alternative systems that offered similar 
 functionality for far lower prices.
</p>
<p>  
 For example, many blind or vision-impaired people pay 1,000 pounds 
 or more for computers bought through specialist firms that also supply 
 them with access technology, since these arrive with access technology 
 conveniently installed, and they can often receive specialist post-sales 
 support as well.
</p>
<p>  
 But a basic home computer with a good enough specification for 
 normal activities such as web browsing and word processing, and 
 enough power to run access technology as well, can cost a lot less than 
 this if it is bought from a mainstream supplier such as Dell. These 
 suppliers are usually running a special offer of the month at any given 
 time that can be around half the cost of a specialist supplier: for 
 example, Dell has a current offer of a PC with an acceptable 
 specification at less than 500 pounds, Orme said.
</p>
<p>  
 Of course, a PC bought this way will not come with access software 
 already loaded onto it for you, or with ongoing support for access 
 technologies. But this need not be a problem, as many specialist 
 suppliers of screen readers and other access software will offer you 
 installation support by telephone and ongoing help even if all you are 
 buying from them is the software, Orme said.
</p>
<p>  
 As far as word processing software is concerned, most people do not 
 need all parts of the suites of Microsoft Office software that they are 
 sold, Orme said. 'Office Basic' - which offers Word, Excel (for 
 spreadsheets) and Outlook - was good enough for most people, and is 
 cheaper than other editions of Office such as the commonly pre-
 installed 'Small Business' version.
</p>
<p>  
 But if people want to cut costs even further, they could simply use the 
 'WordPad' text editor software that comes free with every version of 
 Windows, he said. This does not have most of the sophisticated 
 interactive functions of Word, but has enough to handle most simple 
 word processing tasks like writing letters. You can also find free 
 software additions to WordPad such as spellcheckers which add in 
 some of the missing functions. "So the cost is reduced to zero!" Orme 
 said.
</p>
<p>  
 For screen reader software, there are various products out there that are 
 far cheaper than the market-leading products such as JAWS. Connect 
 Outloud from Freedom Scientific is a pared-down version of JAWS, at 
 around a quarter of the price; LookOut from Choice costs 105 pounds; 
 and Narrator comes free with Windows.
</p>
<p>  
 For screen magnifiers, BigShot from AI Squared and Magnice from 
 Choice (packaged with LookOut as 'Dual') are low-cost; and Lunar 
 Lite from Dolphin and Magnifier which comes with Windows are free 
 solutions.
</p>
<p>  
 There are also cheaper scanning software products, he said, which do 
 not have as many features as the commonly purchased high-end 
 products like Kurzweil 1000 but are good enough for most purposes. 
 For example Cicero from Dolphin is several hundred pounds cheaper. 
 As for optical character recognition software, which converts scanned 
 images to digital text, you can use software that comes in free trial 
 versions on many computer magazine coverdisks  such as FineReader.
</p>
<p>  
 Taking all these money-saving options together, it is possible to reduce 
 the cost of an accessible home computer system to as little as 695 
 pounds for a blind person and 640 pounds for someone with impaired 
 vision, savings of almost 2,000 pounds and 700 pounds respectively on 
 a typical 'state of the art' specification.
</p>
<p>  
 Furthermore, the use of cheaper products did not necessarily mean a 
 poorer user experience, Orme said. "Many of the low cost products do 
 have sophisticated functionality."
</p>
<p>  
 It may be possible to make even greater savings by buying a second-
 hand or recycled PC, he said, although there was no evidence that it 
 was cheaper to build your own PC. "I build my own so I can use the 
 components I want, to customise, but it is not cheaper."
</p>
<p>  
 It was also not yet the case that using the free operating system Linux 
 was a viable option to Windows if one wants to create an accessible 
 environment, Orme said. It was simply too complex a task. "I have 
 tried four times to install Linux and create an accessible system, but 
 have failed every time, and I have worked for 15 years in the access 
 technology industry and build my own PCs," he said. "It may be an 
 option one day - but not this year."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Too Much Informationby Kevin Carey.
</h3>
<p>  
 Up until the end of the seventeenth century, 250 years after the 
 invention of the printing press, a truly learned man could read in his 
 lifetime everything written that was worth reading. Now information is 
 being created and aggregated in such large amounts that it is 
 sometimes referred to in units designated as LOCs, or Libraries of 
 Congress - the equivalent of the entire contents of the US Library of 
 Congress, or 20 million megabytes each. Until quite recently, that 
 accumulation was accounted for by text, hypertext and low resolution 
 graphics. That is now expanding still further with the explosion of high 
 resolution graphics and DVD.
</p>
<p>  
 At the same time the graphic environment, once limited to engraving 
 and painting, expanded into cinema and television, and is on the verge 
 of becoming ubiquitous. Soon our environment will, literally, be 
 plastered with pictures: short movies and adverts on the walls of 
 underground train tunnels; audio visual messages in shop windows 
 triggered by the footfall of passers-by; laser graffiti on every flat 
 architectural surface. This massive visual assault may drive our sighted 
 brothers and sisters mad with over-stimulation, but it might also drive 
 us blind people mad with frustration.
</p>
<p>  
 We already know how mobile phones have changed our lives but 
 enhanced wireless connectivity will mean that the norm will be for our 
 personal devices to be always switched on; indeed, if we're switched 
 off people will automatically assume that we are committing adultery. 
 This means that the pressure on our time will increase, that decisions 
 will have to be taken more quickly and the line between work and 
 leisure will be even further eroded. 
</p>
<p>  
 On the other hand, the environment we live in will be much easier: 
 every building and even every door handle will have a device that can 
 talk to our personal navigating receiver; doors will recognise us, 
 encourage us to enter and open themselves; robotic devices will be 
 safer, cleaner and more flexible than guide dogs. Flexible technology 
 will also mean that almost any object can become a flat screen so that 
 people with limited vision can use their personal device for receiving 
 data which can then be projected onto a wall or table top in their 
 preferred colour and size.
</p>
<p>  
 Perhaps it will be some compensation for the lack of visual information 
 that 3D printers will produce much cheaper and much more accurate 
 models of anything we want to touch. Indeed, I sometimes imagine a 
 world where 3D printers will make the parts for 3D printers!
</p>
<p>  
 By this time, the whole structure of formal education is likely to have 
 broken down and vision-impaired children will be freed from the 
 straitjacket of a rigid curriculum; anything digital, including letters in 
 graphics file, will be available in any kind of print and every kind of 
 Braille. The internet and broadcasting will merge and the key skill will 
 be defining a search for massive search engines. Except for the 
 pictures, we will be able to have any information we want.
</p>
<p>  
 The key cultural question we cannot yet answer for the future is what 
 role the picture will play in our overall lives; how much will society be 
 able to take? In the meantime, however, the steady expansion of radio, 
 the growth of broadband and the natural fit between the information 
 needs of blind people and motorists and the explosion of weblogs all 
 point in the direction of a healthy market for interesting audio data. 
</p>
<p>  
 Finally, here is an interesting thought; in an era of massive data 
 overload there might just be an advantage in being information-
 rationed, leaving space for reflection and the opportunity for 
 perspective. We might yet realise society's stereotype of blind people 
 as prophets with a sixth sense.
