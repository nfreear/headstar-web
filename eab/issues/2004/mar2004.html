<h3 id="i51-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessible Cinema Set To Treble.</h3>
<p> 
 Audio description and subtitling equipment is set to be installed in
 78 cinemas across England, more than trebling the number of accessible
 cinemas in the country, the UK Film Council
 (<a href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk">http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk</a>
) has announced.</p>
<p> 
 The project, which is part of the council's 500,000 pound National
 Lottery-funded Cinema Access Programme, will enable thousands of
 people with sight and hearing impairments to enjoy movies, from the
 latest blockbusters to independent releases.
</p>
<p> 
 The majority of popular film releases are now distributed with an
 audio description narrative and subtitles embedded in digital files.
 However,
 until now only around 30 cinemas in the UK and Ireland have been
 equipped to read these files so that audio description can be
 broadcast
 through personal, wireless headphones, and subtitles can be projected
 on to the screen.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 350,000 pounds has been allocated to buy and install the
 equipment, covering 50 per cent of its costs; cinemas will have to
 provide the other 50 per cent themselves. The equipment costs between
 5,000 and 8,000 pounds per screen, although a cinema would typically
 only need to install it on one screen.
</p>
<p> 
 "When 'silent' movies were replaced by 'talkies' over 70 years ago,
 people with visual impairments began to enjoy the cinema experience,"
 says Derek Brandon, editor of yourlocalcinema.com
 (<a href="http://www.yourlocalcinema.com">http://www.yourlocalcinema.com</a>
), a web site which informs people with sight and hearing problems about local cinema screenings. "But
 for those with hearing impairments, the loss of captions on the
 screen
 to explain the plot was the end of their cinema enjoyment," he said.
 "This year, over 100 cinemas nationwide will become fully accessible
 again for people with sight and hearing problems." Brandon's site has
 now received 50,000 pounds of funding over three years to help
 publicise the new services.
</p>
<p> 
 The new equipment will only be installed in cinemas in England,
 although the UK Film Council is working with the Northern Ireland
 Film and Television Commission (<a href="http://www.niftc.co.uk">http://www.niftc.co.uk</a>
), Scottish Screen (<a href="http://www.scottishscreen.com">http://www.scottishscreen.com</a>
) and Sgren Cymru Wales (<a href="http://www.sgrin.co.uk">http://www.sgrin.co.uk</a>
) to ensure that similar services can be provided across the UK.
</p>
<h3 id="i51-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Technology Starter Courses Simplified.</h3>
<p> 
 The British Computer Association of the Blind (BCAB -
 <a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk">http://www.bcab.org.uk</a>
) is to simplify its foundation training course for the use of assistive technology, making the intensive one-day
 course cheaper and providing more places for students.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Access technology foundation certificate'
 (<a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs/atfc-handout.htm">http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs/atfc-handout.htm</a>
) will from next month cost 350 pounds, a drop of 150 pounds. The course is designed for all
 professionals who work with vision impaired people and who need to
 understand access technology, such as teaching assistants and
 rehabilitation workers.
</p>
<p> 
 According to course manager Stephen Plumpton, students do not need
 to have a training background. "The course encompasses some very
 basic coaching skills and an introduction to access technology for
 the
 visually impaired, such as CCTV; screen readers and screen
 enlargement," he says. "It is intended to ensure access training in
 the UK is of a consistently high standard."
</p>
<p> 
 Plumpton is also working on a training video designed to lead people
 into the foundation course, which has run in its current format since
 last August. BCAB has also been in meetings this week with
 international charity Sightsavers International
 (<a href="http://www.sightsavers.org.uk">http://www.sightsavers.org.uk</a>
) to discuss working with them to help develop similar programmes for development work in Africa.
</p>
<p> 
 Beyond the foundation course, BCAB offers a five-day Trainer
 Certification Scheme (<a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs">http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs</a>
) for those new to training and a two-day course for those with some experience.
 Trainers
 have a written assessment on their assistive technology product of
 choice, followed by a face-to-face assessment. Students are
 re-assessed
 after three years and the product knowledge course can be re-taken as
 new versions of products emerge.
</p>
<p> 
 "We aim to take to the fear out of taking access products out of the
 box," says Plumpton.
</p>
<h3 id="i51-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Museums Urged To Consult On Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 Museums must consult people with disabilities before implementing
 new technologies, Peter Berridge, head of Colchester Museums
 (<a href="http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk">http://www.colchestermuseums.org.uk</a>
) told a conference on the accessibility of cultural institutions last month.
</p>
<p> 
 'Is your museum fully accessible?' was organised by the Museums
 Association (<a href="http://www.museumsassociation.org">http://www.museumsassociation.org</a>
) with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA - <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk">http://www.mla.gov.uk</a>
). It aimed to provide practical advice for museums working towards the
 Disability Discrimination Act, which comes into full force in October
 2004.
</p>
<p> 
 Berridge said Colchester Museums' own experience of introducing
 induction loops for people with hearing difficulties had taught it
 valuable lessons about introducing new technology. The museums only
 realised that deaf users received conflicting commentaries for audio-
 visual presentations when people complained, as the technology hadn't
 been sufficiently tested on users prior to implementation.
</p>
<p> 
 "This was a key turning point for us," he said. "Never again would we
 spend scarce resources on technology without consulting users first."
 Colchester Museums has since established an access advisory group
 called Portal, with a membership of nine people with visual, hearing,
 physical and other impairments. The group, whose members are paid
 for their services, ensures that accessibility is now built into all
 new projects at the museum from the outset.
</p>
<p> 
 Colchester Museums is currently exploring the use of different
 technologies to make visiting its exhibitions more rewarding for
 people
 with impaired vision. These include audio guides delivered through
 handsets; Braille labelling; a greater emphasis on touch in its
 displays;
 and an accessible web site, due to be launched in a few weeks' time.
</p>
<p> 
 The MLA has produced a guide offering museums advice on how they
 can use technology to provide better services to disabled people
 (<a href="http://www.resource.gov.uk/documents/dis_guide07.pdf">http://www.resource.gov.uk/documents/dis_guide07.pdf</a>
).</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04:  National Library Launches Free Online Guides.</h3>
<p> 
 The National Library for the Blind (NLB), the library service for
 vision-impaired people, has developed a series of free online
 training
 courses for support workers and others on the basics of access
 technology (<a href="http://atp.nlb-online.org/Lessons/p_00.php">http://atp.nlb-online.org/Lessons/p_00.php</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The 'Access technology primer' is aimed at rehabilitation workers,
 library staff and educational support staff. Its initial sections
 are:
 Introduction to access technology; Training visually impaired people
 to use computers; Changes you can make to your computer without
 access technology; Windows keyboard commands; JAWS; Supernova;
 and Zoomtext (these last three are types of screen reader and screen
 magnification software).
</p>
<p> 
 The courses are funded by international independent charity the
 Health
 Foundation (<a href="http://www.health.org.uk">http://www.health.org.uk</a>
), and a spokesperson for the NLB told E-Access Bulletin the courses have already attracted a lot
 of interest.
</p>
<p> 
 The library is also developing a visual impairment directory, an
 online
 introduction to working with people with impaired vision, and a guide
 to working with people with mobility issues. It is also gearing up
 for its annual 'Make a noise in libraries week' (MANIL
 <a href="http://www.nlb-online.org/campaigns">http://www.nlb-online.org/campaigns</a>
), a campaign 19 to 25 July to encourage libraries
 to improve access to libraries for vision impaired people.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SPECIAL NOTICE: ACCESSIBLE E-GOVERNMENT- Planning for Accessibility Seminar
- 30 March, Globe Theatre, London.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 On 30 March, E-Access Bulletin's sister publication E-Government
 Bulletin presents a one-day seminar on strategies for ensuring your
 e-services are accessible to all regardless of ability. Government
 guidance for public sector web sites is clear that accessibility
 needs to
 be radically improved, and the passing of the Disability
 Discrimination
 Act means that this is now a legal as well as a moral imperative for
 all e-service channels.
</p>
<p> 
 'E-government for all: planning for accessibility' takes place at
 Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, central London. Speakers include Helen
 Petrie, Professor of Human Computer Interaction Design at City
 University; Guido Gybels, Head of Technology, Royal National
 Institute for Deaf People; and Kevin Carey, vice chairman of the RNIB
 and Director of HumanITy.
</p>
<p> 
 The event is aimed largely at our public sector readers and their
 private
 sector partners, and there is a fee payable. Places cost 295 pounds
 plus VAT for public sector and 395 for private  sector delegates.
 Additional
 delegates booking at the same time receive a 100 pound discount. For

<p>  Karina Gregory writes in with two queries. First, she asks: "Does anyone know of an accessible compiler that I
 can
 use to write and compile Java? I am currently using jGrasp but am not
 finding it very easy to use. Any recommendations gratefully
 received."
</p>
<p> 
 And secondly, she asks: "Does anyone know where I can get a Braille
 font to translate on-screen text into Braille so that it can be
 printed out
 and transferred onto 'swell paper' to create readable Braille? I am
 aware that the RNIB offered one that could be downloaded from their
 website a couple of years ago, but this has been removed and I was
 wondering where else I could get one from?"
 [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i51-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: FONTS CONTINUED:</h3>
<p>  Meanwhile the discussion about readable fonts continues. Karina Gregory (see previous item) says: "I use
 Arial
 or Tahoma as my standard fonts as I find these the easiest to read
 and
 most people who I have met, both visually impaired and fully sighted,
 also recommend the use of these two fonts."
</p>
<p> 
 And Terry Kenaghan of Optek Systems in Australia
 (<a href="http://www.mpx.com.au/~terryk">http://www.mpx.com.au/~terryk</a>
) says: "I became involved with this issue of fonts when I was requested to create software for a typing
 program for vision-impaired children.
</p>
<p> 
 "Initially I used large Arial fonts in the program, which seemed OK,
 until the software was used with very young children, and we ran into
 the problem of recognition where the letters differed from the shapes
 that the child had been introduced to by their parents. I found that
 by using the Century Gothic font it solved these problems and seems
 acceptable to all - a better solution than the Comic Sans font [Last
 issue Peter Thomson of Wolverhampton City Council said Comic Sans
 was the only font he knew of where the letters 'a' and 'g' looked
 like their handwritten counterparts.]

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: SNAPSHOT- LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: A Mountain To Climb.By Dan Jellinek And Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 The annual 'Better Connected' survey provides a useful snapshot of
 local e-government across the UK. Conducted on behalf of the Society
 of IT managers (Socitm - <a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk">http://www.socitm.gov.uk</a>
), the survey looks at each of the 467 council web sites in England, Wales, Scotland and
 Northern Ireland and assesses the range, design and sophistication of
 online services.
</p>
<p> 
 This year, Better Connected has tested all the sites for
 accessibility
 against standards set out by the international World Wide Web
 Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
), which rates sites as 'A' for basic accessibility; 'AA' for higher
 level accessibility and 'AAA' for near-perfection.
</p>
<p> 
 These standards form the cornerstone of UK policy on web
 accessibility. In the government's guidance for the third round of
 council 'implementing electronic government' (IEG) statements
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ieg3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ieg3</a>
), councils are urged to work towards
 'AA' standards.
</p>
<p> 
 All web sites were initially tested using automated software tools,
 and
 those that passed were then subjected to thorough manual tests by a
 team that included specialist consultants from RNIB. The Socitm
 report finds that just 18 councils achieve level 'A' conformance, and
 of the 23 sites assessed as transactional, only three achieve level 'A':
 Surrey, Tameside and Wrexham. Only one site - Tameside - achieves
 'AAA' standard.
</p>
<p> 
 Around half of council sites fail to attain very basic accessibility
 levels
 due a lack of meaningful text tags for images on their sites; and
 many
 sites failed latter stages because when accessed by a browser that
 does
 not support JavaScript, the functionality did not work and there was
 no
 alternative provided. 'Text-only' alternative sites are not much help
 either; of the 143 council web sites with a text-only alternative,
 just seven reached 'A' standard overall.
</p>
<p> 
 While awareness of accessibility has improved greatly among UK
 councils, the survey shows that many are failing to translate this
 into
 effective results. According to Helen Williams of the Socitm Insight
 team, this could be because councils are under more pressure to
 launch
 transactional services and publish a wider range of content on their
 sites. "For example, more councils are publishing data like council
 tax
 bandings on their sites in the form of tables. But they often forget
 to include table header codes for screen readers," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The general trend is a widening gap between those councils getting to
 grips with accessibility, and those that are failing to act,
 according to
 RNIB consultant Donna Smillie. "The sites that were doing well were
 doing very well. Even some that failed are paying a great deal of
 attention to accessibility," she says. "But some that get it wrong
 get it
 very wrong." According to Smillie, this may be because some councils
 can't meet staff training requirements, or because a completely
 redesigned site is in the pipeline, soaking up all available
 resources.
</p>
<p> 
 "With accessibility, there is clearly a mountain to climb," says
 Martin
 Greenwood, who leads the Better Connected project for Socitm. "I
 don't think there's any chance of councils achieving 'AA' within two
 years." Councils that had made efforts to meet accessibility
 standards
 were "very concerned" about the amount of effort involved,
 Greenwood says, with particular problems arising where councils were
 trying to make sites accessible that had not had accessibility in
 mind when first created.
</p>
<p> 
 "But in a sense, they don't have a choice," he says. "The fact is
 that
 there is a law about accessibility - the Disability Discrimination
 Act - so it would seem single 'A' accessibility is a minimum."

<p> 
 Audio description of television programmes and the accessibility of
 electronic programme guides to digital TV were chief among topics
 raised at an open meeting last month at the RNIB's headquarters in
 London.
</p>
<p> 
 The meeting was called to feed into a consultation on access to TV
 services being run by Ofcom, the UK's new broadcasting and
 telecommunications 'super-regulator'
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom2</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Ofcom is seeking the views of people with disabilities to ensure it
 fully
 understands their needs. It is looking to bodies like the RNIB to
 help it
 decide how to regulate television, and has drafted two codes of
 practice: 'Provision of television access services'
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom3</a>
), and a code for electronic programme guides (EPGs - <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ofcom4</a>
), the on-screen programme menus that will eventually appear on all TVs.
</p>
<p> 
 This month, Ofcom will be appointing the first chair of its advisory
 committee for older and disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently 10 per cent of programmes per channel are obliged under the
 Communications Act 2003 to carry audio-description within 10 years
 of the date the channel starts broadcasting. This follows a victory
 achieved by a group of activists including RNIB who lobbied
 parliament last year, when targets were raised from 5 per cent (see
 E-Access Bulletin, issues 37 and 38, January and February 2003).
 However the majority at the consultation felt that the new 10 per
 cent
 target remains disappointing, particularly when compared with an 80
 per cent target for subtitling.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the audio-description targets are now hard-wired into the
 Communications Act, changes could still be made, particularly as
 technical restraints lift, according to Ofcom policy executive Peter
 Bourton. "We have pretty low levels of audio description and I'm sure
 that's going to increase," he told the meeting.
</p>
<p> 
 Caroline Ellis, Parliamentary Affairs Manager at the Disability
 Rights
 Commission, said that while government said last year they couldn't
 raise audio description targets, later in the year the TV channel
 Five
 became the first UK public service broadcaster to broadcast audio
 described programmes using the Sky satellite service (see E-Access
 Bulletin, issue 48, December 2003). It emerged that, while the BBC
 quoted 640 pounds an hour to provide description, Sky undercut this
 price. "The BBC was a blockage on progress," Ellis said.
</p>
<p> 
 One topic on which Bourton was seeking feedback was Ofcom's aim
 to introduce a requirement that 1 per cent of service providers'
 budget
 should be spent on TV access services. One idea fed back from the
 workgroups was raise this to the RNID's suggestion of 2 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 Bourton told attendees that according to the law, the requirement for
 whether audio description provision would be provided at all will
 depend on a channel having an audience share of at least 0.05 per
 cent.
 However, feedback from attendees' workgroups suggested that the
 decision to use audio description should not be dictated in this way.
</p>
<p> 
 Also under discussion was the way in which audio description is
 transmitted. The usual way is to have a separate audio-described
 soundtrack which gets transmitted to headphones during a programme.
 "There's a working assumption that people would still prefer to have
 audio description on separate soundtracks," Bourton said. But this
 may
 not be so among users. "Why should blind people have to sit in the
 corner with headphones on?" said one attendee, arguing that the need
 to always wear headphones isolates vision-impaired users and prevents
 interaction with co-viewers.
</p>
<p> 
 RNIB members argued strongly that repeat programmes should not be
 counted as part of reaching targets. "It's outrageous to count
 repeats to
 up the target figure," said one RNIB employee. Also, "frontloading"
 targets for audio description should be avoided, they said, and Ofcom
 should instead ensure there are incremental increases year-on-year.
</p>
<p> 
 The need for variety among programmes chosen for accessible
 broadcasting - not just "soaps, soaps, soaps" - was also stressed.
 Some
 programmes which are already highly verbal, such as University
 Challenge, were thought by some to be "a waste of audio description,"
 although another said it was dangerous to "say no to anything."
</p>
<p> 
 With the draft code on electronic programme guides also under
 consultation, Bourton said Ofcom has informed EPG providers that
 they are expected to make 'reasonable adjustments' to ensure
 accessibility in line with the Disability Discrimination Act and to
 consult with disability groups about what they should be doing.
 "We've asked for statements to be ready by September and annual
 statements to be produced thereafter," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 While 'talking EPGs' are in development, Bourton said technology
 currently limits what accessible services can be introduced.
</p>
<p> 
 "Set top boxes lack the processing power - they simply can't handle
 talking EPGs," Bourton said. However he was promptly contradicted
 on this point by RNIB's demonstration to attendees of the Netgem box
 (<a href="http://www.netgem.com">http://www.netgem.com</a>
). This provides full audio description as well as internet and radio access and went on the market last January.
</p>
<p> 
 All present agreed, however, that where technical restraints do
 exist,
 service providers should use other methods such as web sites, radio
 announcements and publications from disability organisations to
 disseminate their programme guides.
</p>
<p> 
 And Ellis concluded on an optimistic note: "At least the government
 can't lower the audio description targets," she said. "We have
 parliamentarians working very hard for us. The only way is up."
</p>

 NOTE: The deadline for comments on the access services consultation
 was Friday 12 March, and the EPG consultation closes on 25 March.
