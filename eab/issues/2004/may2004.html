<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i53-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Rnib Moots 'Social Firm' For Web Testing.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
) is investigating the feasibility of creating an independent "social firm", staffed by blind and visually
 impaired people, to provide web site developers with much-needed
 resources for web accessibility testing.
</p>
<p> 
 The announcement is one of the ideas mooted by the RNIB in response
 to the recent Disability Rights Commission (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
) investigation into web accessibility (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 52,
 April 2004), which revealed that some 81 per cent of UK web sites fail
 to meet even the most basic accessibility requirements for disabled
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 "One of the most important messages that came out of the DRC
 findings was that companies can't just follow the Web Accessibility
 Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3c.org/WAI">http://www.w3c.org/WAI</a>
) guidelines; they have to test accessibility among disabled users," says Richard Orme, assistant
 director for information and communications technology at the RNIB.
 "The creation of a social firm would be one way of linking visually
 impaired people with web designers - and providing employment
 opportunities at the same time."
</p>
<p> 
 The idea of an independent "social firm" - supported by funding or
 even set up as a for-profit organisation - fits with the RNIB's aim to
 promote employment opportunities for blind and vision-impaired
 people. Full-time staff would be needed to run and sell the accessibility
 services, while a bank of people could be employed on a flexible basis
 to supply testing services.
</p>
<p> 
 "The RNIB has been contacted by blind and deaf-blind people who are
 ready to get stuck in and companies looking for real users," says Orme.
 "We just need to link the two together."
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB already hosts a social firm at its Redhill College of Further
 Education. Called Insight, the company specialises in transcribing
 information and resources into audio, large print and Braille formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The institute also plans to run regional seminars for businesses that
 want to learn more about web accessibility policy. The seminars will
 include practical demonstrations of the technology blind and partially
 sighted people use to read web sites.
</p>
<h3 id="i53-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Culture Department Site Accessible By Phone.</h3>
<p> 
 Vision-impaired users can now access the entire web site of the
 Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS -
 <a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">http://www.culture.gov.uk</a>
) using a touch-tone phone, following the launch of a three-month trial of new technology that is the first of its
 kind by a UK government agency.
</p>
<p> 
 Users access the service at local call rates by calling 0845 333 0850
 and following spoken instructions. Navigation is achieved using the 12
 keys of a standard phone layout, with right-hand keys providing a
 range of forward options and those on the left moving the user
 backwards.
</p>
<p> 
 The experience aims to be similar to using a text-to-speech computer
 screenreader, for example providing voice output from text tags to
 describe the purpose of links and the content of graphics. And
 according to technology developer PhoneAnything
 (<a href="http://www.phoneanything.com">http://www.phoneanything.com</a>
), content that is often problematic to screenreader users such as tables of data and Adobe pdf documents
 should also be accessible to users of the service.
</p>
<p> 
 In general however, the user experience for this kind of service will
 depend heavily on how well-designed the web site is, said
 PhoneAnything managing director Stefan Haselwimmer. "The
 technology is designed to identify where the main text of a web page
 is, in contrast to links and menus, for example," he said. "There could
 be problems if the page layout is not clear."
</p>
<p> 
 According to the RNIB, providing web access to people who don't use
 computers is valuable to people with impaired vision, who tend to be
 more familiar with phone and TV technology than with computers.
 However, this also means that much of the jargon used in web sites
 will be unfamiliar to many. "Instructions like 'click this' won't mean
 much to someone who doesn't already know about computers and the
 web," said Digital Policy Development Officer Julie Howell. "We need
 to start questioning the assumption that accessible sites would be
 accessible to anyone on another device."
</p>
<h3 id="i53-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: E-Learning Students Search In Vain.</h3>
<p> 
 Students with impaired vision using web-based educational materials
 spend only around 30 per cent of their time actually using the
 materials; the rest of their time is spent searching and navigating for
 pages and options, according to RNIB research.
</p>
<p> 
 Zoe Neumann, technology development officer at the institute's
 Technology in Learning and Employment programme (TiLE -
 <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology">http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology</a>
), revealed the statistic at last weeks' seminar 'E-Learning: the future of training in the public sector'
 (<a href="http://www.electronic-government.com/elearning.htm">http://www.electronic-government.com/elearning.htm</a>
) organised by our sister publication E-Government Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The TiLE team recently arranged focus groups to investigate students'
 experience of using technology in an educational setting, with
 outcomes that "brought you down to earth with a bump," Neumann
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Neumann advised delegates to contact the TiLE team for help in
 measuring for web accessibility in an educational context, and also
 recommended the use of the DAISY digital book format
 (<a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
) as an e-learning tool.</p>
<h3 id="i53-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Spindrift In The Moan Zone.</h3>
<p> 
 Hard-working volunteers who produce news tapes and audio
 magazines for the blind are not being given the respect they deserve,
 according to edition 10 of 'Site for Sore Eyes'
 (<a href="http://www.kenmatthews.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk">http://www.kenmatthews.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk</a>
), an audio magazine for the blind and visually impaired.
</p>
<p> 
 "I have attended various meetings about the impact of audio
 technology on the visually impaired," says Ken Matthews, the site's
 founder and vice-chairman of the Mid-Fife Newstape, a talking
 newspaper and audio magazine service for the visually impaired in
 Glenrothes and Kircaldy. "Generally there are other production
 volunteers from other news tapes, people who have devoted decades to
 their visually impaired friends, and who have intimate knowledge of
 their high-tech equipment, digital, as well as cassette tape. However,
 because we are volunteers and unpaid, we seem to rank lower than
 other people who are paid a handsome wage for their efforts."
</p>
<p> 
 Matthews says that the chairpeople presiding over such meetings tend
 to pay homage to the paid professionals in the industry, while talking
 down to volunteers, despite their considerable expertise.
</p>
<p> 
 'Site for Sore Eyes' was founded in 1997 and is written by Matthews
 under the editorial pseudonym of 'Spindrift'. His aim is to "unspin the
 spin", giving his take on events that hit the headlines.

<p>  Ana Cristina Souto of the Brazilian social inclusion body Rede SACI (<a href="http://www.saci.org.br">http://www.saci.org.br</a>
) writes in on behalf of a nurse, Lana, whose 13-year-old son Rafail is blind, and
 relies on Braille for his reading.
</p>
<p> 
 "I promised him to buy him a computer for his birthday and I did,"
 says Lana. "Now the problem: he is not able to use it without special
 program called Jaws. I checked on the price for it and was almost
 shocked. It's 1,030 dollars. I cannot afford it with all my and Rafail's
 medical bills, mortgage payments and divorce! So the new computer
 now just stands at the table like a piece of furniture and poor Rafail
 going around it all upset.
</p>
<p> 
 "I was wondering if you know any organisation that can assist people
 on buying technology products for blind children. Rafail wants to go
 on internet and news sites to help him with projects and homework, but
 cannot see the screen." [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>

 [Responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i53-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: CIVIL SERVICE:</h3>
<p>  Last month Harish Kotian from India wrote in to ask if any of our readers had information about blind people
 working in the UK civil service, which might help a friend with
 impaired vision who had been denied a civil service job in India.
</p>
<p> 
 Paul McKee of HM Customs and Excise responded: "There are many
 blind and partially sighted workers in the UK civil service, including
 myself. Indeed the recruiting policy of the UK civil service encourages
 diversity and rejects discrimination on the grounds of gender, disability
 ethnic origin and so on. People are appointed to jobs based on their
 ability to do the job, if necessary with reasonable adjustments made to
 what work is done and how it's done.
</p>
<p> 
 "If for example assistive technology would enable a blind or partially
 sighted person to do a job, the equipment is provided by the
 government. This is regardless of whether it's for a clerk or a senior
 administrator.
</p>
<p> 
 "Having said all of the above and believing that the civil service is
 probably the best and most forward thinking employer of disabled
 people, there is a word of caution. We in the UK enjoy the protection
 of the Disability Discrimination Act which protects our right to
 employment."
</p>
<p> 
 Steve Bingham, who works at the Inland Revenue, adds: "I have not
 been able to find any figures that show how many vision impaired
 people work in the British Civil Service. It is likely to be in the
 hundreds. The vast majority are in the lower grades as typists or
 telephonists. A few, mainly professional people like solicitors do make
 the higher grades.
</p>
<p> 
 "At present many departments are having great difficulty integrating
 their typists and telephonists into the mainstream of Civil Service jobs.
 The typing and telephony jobs are being overtaken by technology and
 there are not many jobs that can be completed entirely by a vision-
 impaired person. Even the route I took to get from being a typist to
 being a relatively senior civil servant seems to have been overtaken by
 technology and is no longer open to youngsters - I was a computer
 programmer and am now an adviser on disability issues and
 technology."
</p>
<p> 
 Our reader and regular correspondent Chris McMillan says: "As far
 back as the late 1960s when I left school, the Civil Service was a very
 acceptable way for the registered partially sighted to be employed. One
 or two of my friends went straight into it from school: one has just
 taken redundancy from the British Library. He was a clerk. Another
 friend went into the Tax Office as an audio typist, also in the early
 1970s.
</p>
<p> 
 "Many blind and partially sighted people were able to get jobs then as
 typists or telephonists in big organisations in general. Today, with the
 use of the personal (human) reader and our accessible technology
 equipment, I see no reason why a visually impaired person shouldn't do
 these jobs."
</p>
<p> 
 The story has a happy ending for Harish's friend in India as well: he
 has written in again himself to thank everyone for their encouraging
 responses and to say: "Good news from this side, as well. The supreme
 court has made a favourable judgement and subsequently the blind
 person has now joined the civil service."
</p>
<h3 id="i53-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: USABILITY QUESTION:</h3>
<p>  Steve Bingham of the Inland Revenue (see previous item) also has a response to last issue's report on the
 newly-published Disability Rights Commission (DRC) research into
 web accessibility which has been a major talking point in the
 accessibility community.
</p>
<p> 
 "I read with interest the reports on the DRC's research. I found myself
 wondering if there was a difference in what WAI [the international
 Web Accessibility Initiative] and the DRC were talking about. The
 WAI standards are about accessibility while it sounded to me as if the
 DRC research was more about usability.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is a difference. For example I recently reviewed a set of screens
 for use by people working in a government call centre. The screens
 were reasonably accessible. All the links had alternative texts and all
 the fields had title texts but the screens were still largely unusable by a
 sight-impaired person using a screen reader because most of them had
 over 100 fields on them. It would be too long a process to find
 appropriate fields and complete them while trying to deal with a
 member of the public on a telephone.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is an extreme example, but I have come across many sites that
 are reasonably accessible but they become unusable because of the
 order in which information is given or requested or because there are
 just too many links for the relevant data to be found easily."
</p>
<h3 id="i53-12"><b class="Ps">+</b>12: TIRESIAS FONT:</h3>
<p>  Sylvie Perera of the RNIB Scientific Research Unit has a little more information on Tiresias LPfont which has been
 the subject of recent discussion about accessible typefaces. "Tiresias
 LPfont is part of the family of typefaces that have been designed for
 legibility. LPfont is specifically designed for text in a large print
 publication for people with low vision. For other applications such as
 computer displays, PCfont is more appropriate. The research that went

SECTION THREE: OPINION
- MULTIMEDIA.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Radio Presenters Have More Funby Kevin Carey .
</h3>
<p> 
 The more I think about it, the more I cannot help concluding that the
 most important finding of the recently-published Disability Rights
 Commission research on web accessibility
 (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/publicationsandreports/report.asp">http://www.drc-gb.org/publicationsandreports/report.asp</a>
), as it affects blind people, is
 the finding that they only completed 55 per cent of set tasks as opposed
 to the disability average of 76 per cent. Even on well-designed,
 accessible sites, blind users were three times as slow as sighted peers.
</p>
<p> 
 There is bound to be some argument about the extent to which this
 poor performance can be improved by better applications and better
 user interface design but as pigs will fly before the technology will be
 sufficiently improved, such arguments are academic niceties.
</p>
<p> 
 What this means is that although blind people will need IT skills for
 education, employment and leisure - as means to an end - they will
 rarely be good enough in overcoming systems design problems to
 secure employment in IT per se. The days when the words 'blind' and
 'computer programmer' went together like Morecambe and Wise were
 brief and are long gone. Furthermore, two areas where blind people of
 modest talent have performed reasonably well are fast disappearing:
 the presence of a graceful and efficient personal assistant is giving way
 to the horrible sight of company chief executives typing their own
 memos with two fingers; and machine processing is replacing a host of
 jobs, largely text-based, which used to require simple IT skills.
</p>
<p> 
 Conversely, however, the explosion in all forms of broadcasting and
 multimedia publishing opens up vast new areas of opportunity for
 production and presentation by people with impaired vision. VIP ON
 AIR (<a href="http://www.viponair.com">http://www.viponair.com</a>
), the community radio station operated from Glasgow by blind trainees, has grown into a self confident,
 professional outfit in a matter of months and I have no doubt that some
 of them will be welcomed by mainstream broadcasters in due course.
 Community radio might also allow us to experiment with employment
 models such as the social firm.
</p>
<p> 
 If we are going to take advantage of this new set of opportunities we
 need to rid ourselves of two stereotypes. The first is that all half-bright
 blind people are computer wizards; they are not. Just because you have
 a rucksack full of the latest gadgets doesn't mean you are much good
 compared with your sighted peers. The second is that broadcasting can
 only be successfully carried out by major organisations like the BBC
 and that you need a university degree in Classics to gain employment
 at such places. Radio can and should be cheap and cheerful and not
 over-cooked.
</p>
<p> 
 In starting off by broadcasting over the internet VIP ON AIR is giving
 itself the chance to iron out presentation wrinkles and find its own
 voice before graduating to other broadcasting media. It should also
 soon be flattered by the creation of countless imitations and variants.
 As I have worked in both fields I can personally attest that radio is
 much more fun than computing which, in our sector, might just be a bit
 of a drawback!

</h3>
<p> 
 Cultural change is one of the biggest challenges facing public sector
 bodies as they strive to make their e-government services accessible to
 people with disabilities, according to many of the speakers and
 delegates at E-Government Bulletin's March seminar 'E-Government
 for all: planning for accessibility'
 (<a href="http://www.electronic-government.com/access.htm">http://www.electronic-government.com/access.htm</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Despite legal and moral requirements for public service providers to
 make web sites accessible to all regardless of ability, many
 organisations are still struggling to instil the importance of accessible
 services among management and staff, according to one local authority
 delegate.
</p>
<p> 
 "My authority has produced clear content and communications
 standards for accessibility, but it can be difficult to get staff buy-in,"
 the delegate told an interactive question-and-answer session. "With the
 day-to-day pressures of work and the practical issues around getting
 web content up quickly, things sometimes fall apart."
</p>
<p> 
 It is crucial for public bodies to obtain buy-in for accessibility from the
 highest level of the organisation, she said. But this can be difficult
 when managers think that technical staff can "wave a magic wand" to
 make services accessible, as a second delegate put it, without a real
 understanding of what accessibility involves and the need for training
 across the organisation. Training is becoming even more important as
 public bodies increasingly move towards multiple content contributors
 for their web sites, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Laura van Weyenbergh, e-communications officer at Rushcliffe
 Borough Council (<a href="http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk">http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk</a>
), agreed that communication with staff was the key. "It is crucial to do the
 groundwork to ensure that web site contributors understand their role
 in accessibility," she said. "We have tried to encourage staff to view
 accessibility as the norm rather than extra work, but admittedly this has
 been difficult."
</p>
<p> 
 Access to the right skills and knowledge about accessibility is another
 problem for government bodies. Often they don't have the requisite
 skills in-house, but equally they can't always rely on the expertise of
 their IT suppliers or the web developer community, delegates heard.
</p>
<p> 
 One problem is that a confusing array of so-called accessibility
 'standards' can be difficult for non-specialist organisations to evaluate,
 said Tom Adams, senior digital media consultant at the Office of the e-
 Envoy (OeE - <a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk</a>
). "Although the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines
 [<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI]">http://www.w3.org/WAI]</a>
 have become the de facto international standard for accessibility, they were only ever intended as guidelines
 and as such are open to interpretation," he said. While the OeE has
 produced its own guidelines on accessibility
 (<a href="http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm">http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm</a>
), based on standards such as e-GIF and the WAI guidelines, he admitted that "we, like
 everyone else, are slow in adopting and adhering to the guidelines."
</p>
<p> 
 Automated software tools that check web accessibility, such as the
 well-known Watchfire Bobby (<a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com">http://bobby.watchfire.com</a>
), can provide some guidance for government bodies, but are of limited
 value, according to one delegate. In particular, it is only by testing sites
 with users that government bodies can guarantee that their services are
 not only technically accessible - capable of being used with assistive
 technologies, such as screen readers - but usable.
</p>
<p> 
 However, delegates highlighted the difficulties of engaging with user
 communities to get help in testing. "Although we advertised to get
 input from web users, it was difficult to get their response," said van
 Weyenbergh. "In the end, we didn't get much input from the local
 community."
</p>
<p> 
 Even if they do manage to get feedback from the public, how can
 government bodies and their suppliers measure the outcomes of user
 testing, asked Ian Franklin, human factors consultant for technology
 supplier EDS. Are there metrics available to help with this?
</p>
<p> 
 This question sparked a debate among experts about the nature of
 usability. Guido Gybels, director of new technologies at the Royal
 National Institute for Deaf People (<a href="http://www.rnid.org.uk">http://www.rnid.org.uk</a>
), and the OeE's Adams agreed that usability was a largely subjective issue,
 dependent on the user's skills, experience and background. However,
 Helen Petrie, professor of human computer interaction design at City
 University (<a href="http://www.city.ac.uk">http://www.city.ac.uk</a>
), said that her research has shown that there will always be a common core of key outcomes across all
 tests by all user groups, however diverse.
</p>
<p> 
 The question for service providers, said Petrie, is at which point they
 are happy that their accessibility efforts are sufficient. Is it once 90 or
 95 per cent of people can access their site, for example? Adams agreed
 that 100 per cent accessibility is an unachievable goal, because there
 will always be someone who cannot access your site because they are
 using a very unusual web browser, for example. The important thing
 for local authorities, he said, is to be able to show that they have taken
 all reasonable steps possible to make their site as accessible as
 possible.
</p>
<p> 
 This work will pay off for all users, said Petrie. "If your organisation
 conducts testing with people with print disabilities, it will pick up
 problems that are common to all users. The result will be an exemplary
 site for everyone," she said.
