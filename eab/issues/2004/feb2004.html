<h3 id="i50-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Access Gap To Narrow Within Five Years.</h3>
<p> 
 The gap between accessible and mainstream technology in the US will
 narrow significantly over the next five years, according to one leading
 expert.
</p>
<p> 
 Mike Paciello, founder and president of accessibility consultancy the
 Paciello Group (<a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com">http://www.paciellogroup.com</a>
), made the prediction during the course of a seminar broadcast live on the web last week by
 internet TV station AT508 (<a href="http://www.at508.com">http://www.at508.com</a>
) The online debate, 'Homeland security - the roadmap for achieving
 section 508 compliance' (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/seminar1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/seminar1</a>
), focused on section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act 2001
 (<a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
), which requires all US government web sites to be accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Paciello, who is also co-founder of the World Wide Web Consortium's
 Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>
), said: "We see an accessibility gap. Advances made within technology where fields of
 accessibility are concerned tend to lag behind those advances made in
 mainstream information technology." However, he said: "As a result of
 compliance with section 508 and World Wide Web consortium
 standards, what we should see over the next five years is a closing of
 the technology gap, so we see more products coming out immediately
 and inherently accessible".
</p>
<p> 
 Viewers could email questions to the seminar. According to Paciello,
 the Department of Homeland Security
 (<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/accessibility.jsp">http://www.dhs.gov/dhspublic/accessibility.jsp</a>
) is leading the way in Section 508 implementation within the US government, which is the
 single largest employer of people with disabilities in the US.
 In making a technology accessible it is crucial to involve users in the
 testing stages, said Paciello. "If you are solely relying on tools to
 ensure your web site is accessible, I can guarantee you it will not be;
 you need to get the users involved". He said there was also a need to
 educate staff: "Employees need to understand how people with
 disabilities use these electronic information technologies," Paciello
 said.
</p>
<h3 id="i50-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Workgroup To Promote Open Source Solutions.</h3>
<p> 
 A US-based group which promotes open source software has launched
 an accessibility workgroup to establish standards for making the Linux
 operating system and associated software accessible to people with
 impaired vision.
</p>
<p> 
 The free standards group (<a href="http://www.freestandards.org">http://www.freestandards.org</a>
), an independent non-profit body, launched the workgroup at a Linux
 conference in New York last month
 (<a href="http://accessibility.freestandards.org">http://accessibility.freestandards.org</a>
). The group will create standards to support assistive technologies for
 users of open source applications - the software that contains a free
 and openly available source code. One key priority will be to develop a
 standard to enable assistive technology such as screen readers and
 magnifiers to interact with graphical user interface controls.
 Janina Sajka, the group's chair, told E-Access Bulletin: "Technology is
 too expensive and too cumbersome to learn to use. Through the Free
 Standards Accessibility Workgroup we aim to change that; we will do
 so in full conformance with the communitarian spirit of open source
 development."
</p>
<p> 
 Currently, many open source platforms use inaccessible graphical user
 interfaces for which few assistive technologies exist. The group will
 work with Linux developers to make applications accessible, provide
 advice and information, and encourage the implementation of user
 support across platforms that promote free and open standards.
 "Users are invited to participate in the design and development of the
 technology they need. Our process isn't anybody's private property. 
 It's
 fully public and participatory," said Sajka, who is also research
 director at the American Foundation for the Blind (see E-Access
 Bulletin, issue 49, January 2004, section three). Other members include
 representatives from Sun Microsystems; IBM and several open source
 organisations.
</p>
<h3 id="i50-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Uk Radio Station Plan For Blind Community.</h3>
<p> 
 Plans to form a consortium to create the UK's first national radio
 service dedicated to blind and partially sighted listeners were 
 unveiled
 last week by a leading charity.
</p>
<p> 
 St Dunstan's (<a href="http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk">http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk</a>
), the charity for people with impaired vision who have served in the armed forces, has called
 on interested parties to form a steering group to explore broadcasting
 platforms, funding options and content ideas for the service.
 The UK lags behind other nations that already have bespoke national
 radio stations for the blind community such as Australia, with its 
 Radio
 for the Print Handicapped (RPH - <a href="http://www.rph.org.au">http://www.rph.org.au</a>
). And America has ACB Radio, owned and operated by the American
 Council for the Blind (<a href="http://www.acbradio.org">http://www.acbradio.org</a>
), which webcasts programmes across 70 countries.
</p>
<p> 
 There is already an RNIB-backed web-based radio station based in
 Scotland, VIP ON AIR (<a href="http://www.junction-18.com/viponair/home/view">http://www.junction-18.com/viponair/home/view</a>
), which broadcasts from Glasgow to the world. But to date there is no comparable service for the whole of the
 UK.
 "Our vision is to create a service that is dedicated to the needs of 
 the
 UK's blind and partially sighted communities, but doesn't focus solely
 on 'visually impaired' issues," says Nick Ward, fundraising and
 communications director at St Dunstan's. "We have had a lot of
 interest from blind and partially sighted programme makers. Engaging
 them in the service will ensure that we take a wide view on content."
 The steering group will explore broadcasting the service over BskyB's
 digital satellite platform, but there are other options, such as
 webcasting, that it wants to examine. It will also look at potential
 sources of funding such as grants, sponsorships, advertising sales and
 donations from members of the steering group.
</p>
<p> 
 St Dunstan's says several organisations including the RNIB, the Royal
 London Society for the Blind (<a href="http://www.rlsb.org.uk">http://www.rlsb.org.uk</a>
) and National Talking Express (<a href="http://www.ntexpress.org">http://www.ntexpress.org</a>
), have already expressed an interest in joining the steering group.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: For more on St Dunstan's see E-Access Bulletin issue 29, May
 2002 (<a href="http://www.headstar.com/eab/issues/may2002.html">http://www.headstar.com/eab/issues/may2002.html</a>
).</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Spoken Text Messages'Live Within Weeks'.</h3>
<p> 
 The telecoms giant BT (<a href="http://www.bt.com">http://www.bt.com</a>
) is set to launch "within weeks" a new service allowing text messages from mobile phones to
 be sent as synthesized voice messages to fixed-line phones.
 The service represents an important breakthrough in mobile technology
 for the blind and partially sighted. "Until recently, SMS [the system
 used to send text messages] has been a no-go area for blind people,"
 says Julie Howell, digital development policy officer at the RNIB
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
). "But if you can use a landline to receive speech-enabled text messages from mobile users, that represents an
 interesting opportunity."
</p>
<p> 
 Users with voicemail can have messages delivered directly into their
 mailboxes and for those who don't have voicemail, a synthesized voice
 will deliver the text message to them in an automated phone call.
 BT Wholesale (<a href="http://www.btwholesale.com">http://www.btwholesale.com</a>
), the network services arm of BT, will offer the SMS-to-voice service to other fixed line and
 mobile operators in the UK. A number of mobile operators have
 participated in trials and have already signed up for the live service.
</p>
<p> 
 "We fully expect all of them to come on board," says Andy Jugg, head
 of messaging products at BT Wholesale. The operators can then
 determine their own pricing for the service to consumers.
 BT says the new service could not only benefit people with sight
 problems who have not been able to use SMS to date, but also business
 users and parents who aren't comfortable with texting but want to keep
 in touch with their children. "This is a great example of a technology
 that happens to be particularly useful for the blind and partially
 sighted, but also has some great mainstream applications," says
 Howell.

<h3 id="i50-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: TYPE CAST:</h3>
<p>  A large number of readers have responded to John Conway's query in our last issue about the best fonts to use for
 readable text - clearly a hot topic. Veronica Dry was brief and to-the-
 point in describing the first choice of font for many: "Definitely 
 Arial.
</p>
<p> 
 Everyone I know who can still read prefers Arial to all other fonts."
 Sue Allard, Co-Editor of the Gloucestershire magazine for people with
 impaired vision Modern-Eyes (<a href="http://www.modern-eyes.co.uk">http://www.modern-eyes.co.uk</a>
), agrees: "We have carried out extensive research to find out the fonts most
 visually impaired people prefer and Times Roman was a definite no-
 no. Just about everyone we asked preferred Arial as a usable font. We
 also use bold as a matter of course and Arial Black for headings as we
 found that italics and underlining were also found to make reading
 difficult."
</p>
<p> 
 Percy Limb writes: "I am registered blind and have little sight in one
 eye. I find that Arial font 24-point size is the best for me although,
 even to read that properly, I need to use a magnifying glass. When I
 receive E-Access Bulletin, I click on 'Reply to Sender' and then
 'Format' and 'Rich Text' and that automatically changes it into my
 default setting of Arial 24."
</p>
<p> 
 And the Arial vote is strengthened still further by Erica Cole from
 RNIB New College in Worcester, who says: "All our students use
 Arial, and whatever size they want. It is however, a good idea to ask
 people which font they would like as some people have specific
 requirements."
</p>
<p> 
 Sylvie Kashdan, instructor with the Seattle-based KAIZEN programme
 for English learners with visual impairments, largely agrees: "We have
 found that Arial is generally most preferred. We have also found that
 most students and volunteer tutors find a 20-point text size most
 readable, even though we know that 18-point and even 16-point was
 recommended in the past as a standard. [However] now that we have
 the flexibility that computers permit, if it is possible, it is always 
 best
 to allow each person to choose whatever size font suits them best.
 "We have also found that most of our large print readers find text more
 readable if there is no bolding, italics or underlining. Spacing 
 between
 words, between letters and between the lines seems to be the best way
 to set things off while maintaining the maximum readability. But, of
 course, there are always some people who find bolding helpful.
 "Finally, we have found that a few people whose primary problem is
 limited field of vision find it easier to use 13-point Century
 Schoolbook rather than Arial."
</p>
<p> 
 And Jane Fowler, marketing officer at Hampshire County Council,
 says serif fonts are not always a no-no: "Our guidance for staff on
 making communications accessible currently advises the use of sans
 serif fonts, particularly when producing information in large print
 formats. However, we are currently reviewing this guidance and will
 be amending it to follow the 'Clear print' guidelines in the RNIB's
 'See it right' pack which state that serif fonts are often easier to 
 read
 for large bodies of text, but warns against using highly stylised
 typefaces."
</p>
<p> 
 Judyth Mermelstein from Montreal adds a note about ensuring
 flexibility with fonts when sending emails: "Sending e-mail in plain
 text means your messages go out without any font specifications -- 
 each recipient gets to see your message in the default font he or she 
 has
 chosen in the email program used. Sending e-mail in HTML normally
 means that the user's default font will also be respected, whether the
 message is read in an email program or directly in a browser.
 "On the other hand, people who use Microsoft products usually don't
 know exactly what tags their programs are embedding. Microsoft has
 built its empire on doing things in ways that violate standards and
 inconvenience people using standards-oriented software.
 "If you are writing your message in Outlook Express and sending it in
 Microsoft's version of HTML (which is rather different from both
 standard HTML and standard XML) the program itself inserts the tags
 and specifies that recipients must see the message in the fonts and 
 sizes
 you've chosen. From the perspective of the visually-impaired, this is
 not a good thing. Microsoft software also has a nasty habit of 
 inserting
 far more tags than are necessary which results in doubling or tripling
 the size of the file, a real inconvenience for those who pay by the
 minute for their data transfers or have slow connections."
 Elizabeth Izatt of the Scottish Sensory Centre, University of
 Edinburgh, sends in a useful reference to an academic article on this
 issue: 'Size counts: the significance of size, font and style of print 
 for
 readers with low vision sitting examinations', by Marianna Buultjens,
 Stuart Aitken, John Ravenscroft and Kevin Carey. This piece,
 published in the British Journal of Visual Impairment volume 17, 1999
 (ISSN: 0264-6196), "concludes that Helvetica N24 plain text was the
 winner by a whisker over Arial N24 plain text."
 And John Thompson, managing director of Mousetrap Media, adds
 another useful reference, to a book on accessible web typography:
 <a href="http://www.scotconnect.com/webtypography">http://www.scotconnect.com/webtypography</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Finally Peter Thomson, e-government policy officer at Wolverhampton
 City Council, has a supplementary question which may keep the
 discussion bubbling into our next issue: "In a recent course I attended
 about the Disability Discrimination Act, it was stated that it is
 preferable to use a font in which the letters 'a' and 'g' look like 
 their
 hand-written versions, rather than the fancier ones typically used in
 print. The argument was that people with reading difficulties are
 confused by the different forms of these letters. This was news to me,
 is it an accepted idea?
</p>
<p> 
 Also, it seems that unfortunately the only common Windows font that
 meets that requirement is 'Comic Sans' - not really ideal as a 
 corporate standard"

<h3 id="i50-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: WELSH SYNTHESIZER:</h3>
<p>  Last month Rebecca Redmile, a daily living skills instructor from Toronto, asked about software or screen
 readers which will read the Welsh language. Bob Hall, RNIB
 technology officer for Wales, wrote in with news of the institute's
 Welsh Access Technology project, the development of a Welsh
 language synthesiser so that the speech output is in a near naturally-
 sounding male or female voice.
</p>
<p> 
 "This has taken a large step forward recently with the announcement of
 a grant from the European Social Fund and Welsh Language Board to
 fund a project at Bangor University to produce a synthesizer which has
 a wide range of applications. RNIB Cymru has held meetings with the
 grant-holder and Dolphin Computer Access
 (<a href="http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/index_dca.htm">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/index_dca.htm</a>
 - the producers of the Hal speech output software) to ensure that one of the first uses of the
 synthesiser will be in access technology software. It is hoped to have 
 a prototype Welsh language synthesiser ready in July 2004 with an
 improved version available in November 2005.
 "In the interim there is an 'Apollo 2' hardware synthesizer available
 from Dolphin with a Welsh language voice but it is expected that the
 new synthesizer described above will be much more advanced."
 Vicky Millson, rehabilitation officer at the Gowerton Resource Centre
 for Visually Impaired People in Swansea, adds that if anyone is
 interesting in buying an Apollo 2 synthesiser "It may be worth trying
 to get a second-hand one as for most [purposes] they are now obsolete,
 but were previously such expensive pieces of hardware that some may
 be reluctant to part with it!"
</p>
<p> 
 Finally Russell Bloom, chair of the Wales Council for the Blind, adds
 that Braille Maker for Windows (<a href="http://www.braillemaker.com">http://www.braillemaker.com</a>
) has a Welsh module. [Further responses to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: IT'S 50 STEPS FORWARD - AND 49 BACKby Kevin Carey  <a href="mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a>
E-Access Bulletin is 50 issues old today. Now, anybody who knows
the variety and extent of my cellar will readily appreciate that I am 
no
party pooper; but on this day of celebration, I feel I need to tell you 
just
how miserable I am when I think of the last 50 months.
</h3>
<p> 
 In December 1999 I was very happy with my mid-range 486 laptop
 computer running WordStar 7 for DOS, my Navigator 40-character
 Braille display and its software. The whole unit was heavy for travel
 but everything else about it was efficient and comfortable. But in 2002
 the hardware of the laptop gave out: the disc drive died; the space bar
 stopped working; and when we opened it up we found all sorts of other
 emerging corruptions.
</p>
<p> 
 I switched to a Sony Vaio, an ALVA refreshable Braille display and
 JAWS screen-reader software. This was a disaster in spite of the huge
 cost of the assemblage, which was slightly heavier than the old kit: 
 the
 cursor clung slavishly to column 40; fighting for autonomous control
 of layout was exhausting; everything was slower; I missed block-
 marking and needed three hands for most editing operations.
 After four months of hell I gave up and moved to a BrailleNote
 portable notetaker which was brilliant with its cursor tending to the 
 left
 of the display; block markers; ability to output a variety of formats;
 and, of course, size and lightness. However, I subsequently stupidly
 agreed to have it upgraded, at which point: the cursor took residence 
 on
 or near the farthest left column; the system refused to recognise the
 existence of files typed from the prompt, particularly if they had the
 digit 4 in them (which is pretty inconvenient in 2004); the conversion
 protocols began to throw out or swallow work on a random basis; and,
 as I write, the machine is given to showing rubbish on the majority of
 the display.
</p>
<p> 
 So, on the whole I am worse off than I was four years ago, with much
 more expensive kit but less control and more faults.
 Never mind. This is, after all, the age of the mobile phone. Four years
 ago I had a Nokia which was the size and weight of a quarter of a
 brick. Now I have a Nokia 9210i Communicator of the same weight
 and size but this one has a full qwerty keyboard, sends e-mails and
 texts, and talks. I am theoretically much better off but in practice 
 the
 front panel with the standard phone doesn't talk and the keyboard
 controlled part of the phone is too much of a faff. I just want a phone
 which tells me in speech what number I have pressed; and I want voice
 out to accompany my use of cursor keys so that I can use standard
 menus.
</p>
<p> 
 I am also sad to report that although I am no worse off in the area of
 television access, I am comparatively much worse off. Four years ago
 hardly any of my friends had multi channel satellite television; now
 most of them have it, as I do, but my electronic programme guide is
 inaccessible. Instead of one remote controller I have two; but neither 
 of
 them talk. And every time I go into a hotel I have a struggle to master
 yet another remote controller configuration. My good old 1980s hi-fi
 gave out two years ago and I could not find a new one to buy that I can
 tune myself. I can still tune my good old Sony portable ICF-SW 7600
 radio, but I have not yet found a digital radio that I can access
 autonomously.
</p>
<p> 
 Wherever I go I meet numeric key pads which will not talk to me so I
 have to hope that I am keying accurately. It would be so easy to
 produce synthetic speech. Neither would it be difficult to standardise
 key features on remote controllers, as we have done so on telephones.
 The shining exception to this depressing trend is my microwave cooker
 all of whose keys 'talk', assisted by my 'talking' kitchen scales. So
 unless there are some basic improvements in access to technology
 during the period covered by the next 50 issues of E-Access Bulletin, I
 will grow fat from eating for comfort.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: RESEARCH- WEB ACCESS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Problems Dissected In The User Labby John Knight And Marie Jefsioutine .
</h3>
<p> 
 During the summer of 2003 the Birmingham Institute of Art and
 Design's usability centre User-Lab (<a href="http://www.userlab.com">http://www.userlab.com</a>
) ran an online questionnaire, conducted interviews and carried out a literature
 review on web accessibility. Some 117 respondents participated
 including designers, information officers and accessibility advocates.
 The survey found that 86 per cent of respondents agreed that most web
 developers do not have adequate training in web accessibility. Indeed,
 'Lack of expertise' was cited as the main barrier to developing
 accessible web sites.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey results also indicate a lack of awareness among managers
 of the importance of accessibility and the barriers to improving
 accessibility. Some 64 per cent of respondents agreed that
 'Management is unaware of the importance of web accessibility', and
 'Lack of policies/management' was the second highest barrier cited to
 web accessibility. This might suggest that improving accessibility
 requires high profile campaigning.
</p>
<p> 
 Interestingly however, the vast majority of respondents (94 per cent)
 said that 'Clients ask for their sites to be accessible'. Whether these
 clients are representative of all organisations with a web presence is
 unclear.
</p>
<p> 
 The World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative
 (WAI) guidelines, the generally accepted international standard for
 accessibility, came in for some criticism from respondents. In all, 67
 per cent agreed that 'Some WAI guidelines are difficult to implement',
 and difficulties with the guidelines were placed third in 'Barriers to
 developing accessible web sites.'
</p>
<p> 
 The accessibility consultant Joe Clark (<a href="http://www.joeclark.org">http://www.joeclark.org</a>
) notes that "Virtually all online accessibility resources are glorified 
 rehashes
 of the WAI guidelines, which are opaque, very poorly organised,
 daunting, and in many cases unrealistic".
 Providers of software tools designed to audit sites automatically for
 accessibility - usually against the WAI guidelines - were also said to
 provide a raw deal.
</p>
<p> 
 One accessibility testing officer posted an apocryphal tale: 
 "Previously,
 when we planned for the cost of accessibility testing software, we
 planned to purchase one copy of Bobby. Now, Watchfire's new policy
 meant that we would instead have to buy up to ten copies of Bobby,
 increasing the cost to us from 299 US Dollars to 2,999 Dollars - hardly
 a trivial increase".
</p>
<p> 
 The consultant Cheryl Wise adds: "Tools are lacking or horribly
 expensive for AAA compliance [the highest benchmark for
 accessibility set by WAI]". And the very notion of accessibility
 standards is criticised by some, who say: "What good are standards
 when browsers change so fast by adding new features every month?
 The needs or demands of the users change with the latest killer
 applications."
</p>
<p> 
 Most respondents accepted there is a trade-off between accessibility
 and other design issues. Just over half (56 per cent) agreed with the
 statement: "There is a conflict between usability and accessibility".
 Much of the literature on accessibility questions the tendency for
 people to advocate text-only web sites or versions of sites, and points
 to the opportunities for enriching user experiences for everyone.
 On a more positive note, 48 per cent disagreed with the statement:
 "Most development life-cycles are too short to incorporate
 accessibility." Some 51 per cent agreed that "web accessibility
 provides a return on investment" and 80 per cent that accessibility 
 does not inhibit innovation.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, food for thought in a contribution which noted: "There are
 situations where different problems may impose conflicting
 requirements on accessibility . . . up to now, there has been little 
 open  discussion about this."
