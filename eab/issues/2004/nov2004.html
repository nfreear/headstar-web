<h3 id="i59-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Free Talking Book Service Launched.</h3>
<p>  
 A free DAISY digital talking book transcription service for teachers
 and students has been launched by Virtual SEN
 (<a href="http://www.virtualsen.com">http://www.virtualsen.com</a>
), a digital publishing collective that develops accessible new media resources for special needs education.
</p>
<p>  
 DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System -
 <a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
) is the key international standard for talking books which can be accessed by blind people and others with problems
 reading print.
</p>
<p>  
 The DAISY and education area of the Virtual SEN site
 (<a href="http://www.virtualsen.com/daisy/daisy.htm">http://www.virtualsen.com/daisy/daisy.htm</a>
) allows teachers and students to submit content - worksheets, essays, booklets - along with
 relevant pictures, for manual transformation by specialists into
 downloadable DAISY books, with synchronised, searchable text and
 audio.
</p>
<p>  
 An archive will then be made available for free to users, providing a
 pool of accessible education content.
</p>
<p>  
 "We wanted to offer a free service to pupils and teachers interested in
 creating and accessing DAISY content," says Will Pearson, founder of
 Virtual SEN. "This forum enables teachers and pupils to share material
 and encourages them to experiment with the DAISY format."
</p>
<p>  
 Pearson recently left the RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
), where he was responsible for the DfES-funded "DAISY Literacy Materials for the
 Inclusive Classroom" project to explore how DAISY content could be
 exploited in schools. The initial focus of transcription work is likely to
 be on early years fiction, he said.
</p>
<p>  
 In order to access the free archive, users will need DAISY playback
 software, such as EaseReader from Dolphin
 (<a href="http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/audio/">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/audio/</a>
) or the DAISY Consortium's free TPB Reader (<a href="http://www.daisy.org/tpbreader/index.asp?lang=en">http://www.daisy.org/tpbreader/index.asp?lang=en</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i59-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Mixed Welcome For First Accessible Dvd.</h3>
<p>  
 The RNIB has issued a qualified welcome to a new DVD version of
 the Shawshank Redemption, the first general release film DVD to be
 issued with audio description and talking menus for vision-impaired
 people.
</p>
<p>  
 Audio description offers a descriptive narrative of actions, gestures,
 scene changes and other visual information which would not otherwise
 be available to vision-impaired people.
</p>
<p>  
 The new DVD has been produced by Granada Ventures
 (<a href="http://www.granadamedia.com">http://www.granadamedia.com</a>
) on the tenth anniversary of the film's initial release
</p>
<p>  
 The RNIB has broadly welcomed the new three-disc boxed set DVD,
 although it criticised the fact that only one of the three discs has audio-
 described content with talking menus. This means that while vision-
 impaired people can access the main feature and choose specific
 scenes, they can't, for example, access interviews with actors on the
 other discs.
</p>
<p>  
 Additionally, when the discs are put into a DVD player, there is no
 way of identifying which disc is which.
</p>
<p>  
 "The talking menu feature should be available on all three discs. If you
 couldn't see at all and put disc two or three into your DVD player,
 you'd have no idea what was on that disc, let alone how to get to the
 area you were interested in," says Jill Whitehead, broadcasting and
 talking images officer at the RNIB. She also criticised the fact that the
 disc that contains audio content only speaks three out of six of its menu
 options, meaning vision-impaired people are excluded from some
 content such as the directors' cut.
</p>
<p>  
 "The problem with this product is that the publisher has decided for
 blind and visually impaired people what they might want to access,"
 says Whitehead. "This is in effect a form of censorship." If Granada
 Ventures had consulted with the RNIB it would have been able to
 avoid such basic design faults, Whitehead says.
</p>
<p>  
 However, she welcomed the broad efforts towards accessibility being
 made. "Granada have made a giant step forward in making DVDs
 accessible and showing to the rest of the industry what's possible, they
 just haven't gone quite far enough. Hopefully this will be the first of
 many more and, for a first attempt, this is a very commendable effort."
</p>
<h3 id="i59-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Directory Targets Every Uk Business.</h3>
<p>  
 A free online directory has been launched with the aim of providing
 information on the accessibility of facilities and services provided by
 every UK business.
</p>
<p>  
 'Direct Enquiries' (<a href="http://www.directenquiries.com">http://www.directenquiries.com</a>
) provides details about the current accessibility of facilities such as lifts; toilets; 
 counter
 heights; lighting; alternative formats such as large print and Braille;
 and staff assistance; and also what new accessibility features are
 planned to be provided in the future.
</p>
<p>  
 Users must register with the service, and can then search for
 information by business type, name or location. They may also request
 email alerts to notify them when frequently-used businesses update
 information. Users may also send feedback on what they think about
 services and facilities.
</p>
<p>  
 "The goal over the next year is to get every business service provider
 in the UK on board," said Liz Hollander, a spokesperson for the
 service. The latest signatories are London Transport and the
 Metropolitan Police, and discussions with the prison service are
 ongoing.
</p>
<p>  
 The directory was set up as a private company by its chief executive
 Grant Kennedy, whose father is wheelchair-bound, in association with
 the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR -
 <a href="http://www.radar.org.uk">http://www.radar.org.uk</a>
) and the Employers' Forum on Disability (<a href="http://www.employers-forum.co.uk/www/index.htm">http://www.employers-forum.co.uk/www/index.htm</a>
). Businesses pay 35 pounds to register with Direct Enquiries, of which around 10
 pounds goes to its two charity partners.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Pda Debate Warms Up For Techshare.</h3>
<p>  
 An application that allows personal digital assistants (PDAs) to "talk"
 to users is to be launched in the Spring and will be showcased at the
 RNIB assistive technology exposition Techshare this week
 (<a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 The software speaks aloud to PDA users who navigate using a tactile
 interface. "What we hope to do is give customers the option of taking
 an off-the-shelf PDA and installing the software," said Steve Bennett,
 sales director at the software's creator Dolphin Computer Access
 (<a href="http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/index_dca.htm">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/index_dca.htm</a>
). It will work with the Windows CE operating platform and the objective, Bennett said, is to
 adapt it for use with the majority of existing PDA brands.
</p>
<p>  
 While as yet unnamed, it may be called HAL for PDAs.
</p>
<p>  
 According to Bennett, vision-impaired PDA users previously had to
 buy specialist hardware which was costly and only manufactured in
 small quantities.
</p>
<p>  
 However, according to Bill Alker of the RNIB press office, other
 companies designing accessible PDAs are "talking down" the new
 development, suggesting such "add-on" technology could never be as
 good as a product with built-in accessibility.
</p>
<p>  
 "Other companies have tried to get into the PDA market by putting a
 screen reader on top of existing PDAs," said Jonathan Mosen of Pulse
 Data International (<a href="http://www.pulsedata.com">http://www.pulsedata.com</a>
), which produces the BrailleNote PK, a PDA with an interface designed for blind people.
 "However the 'P' in PDA stands for 'personal,' and our research has
 shown that what's most important is how quickly you can get
 information in and out of the device. KeySoft, our blindness-specific
 interface, is efficient yet intuitive."
</p>
<p>  
 However Richard Orme, assistant director of ICT services at the RNIB,
 said the Braillenote PK was the subject of controversy on its release, as
 it cost some 3,500 pounds.
</p>
<p>  
 The debate will continue at Techshare, to be held in Birmingham, UK
 tomorrow and Friday. Other highlights include a presentation by Web
 Accessibility Initiative director Judy Brewer. Full Techshare reporting
 will appear in our December issue.

<h3 id="i59-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: US Law:</h3>
<p>  Cynthia Waddell, Executive Director of the International Center for Disability Resources on the Internet, writes in
 to correct "significant errors" in the article we ran in our last issue
 headed 'US law unravels over the web' (issue 59, October 2004). She
 says: "Unfortunately, the Southwest Airlines accessible web case has
 generated a number of misleading articles in the US and abroad
 regarding the status of accessible web and disability rights in the US.
</p>
<p>  
 "It is not true that the US Court of Appeals ruled on whether or not
 organisations providing online services needed to comply with the
 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In fact, the court did not reach
 that issue and simply dismissed the case due to procedural issues.
 Contrary to what was reported, this means that the court did not rule on
 the merits of the case and did not uphold the lower court ruling. As the
 court stated in their opinion, none of the issues on appeal were properly
 before them and so they were unable to reach the merits of the case.
 (See page two of the opinion filed September 24, 2004 -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/findlaw1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/findlaw1</a>
). In fact, one of the difficult issues before the lower court was the fact that airlines such as
 Southwest are generally not covered by the ADA, but by another
 disability access statute, the pre-ADA Air Carrier Access Act.
</p>
<p>  
 "However, the US Court of Appeals opinion noted that even though
 the merits of the Southwest Airlines case could not be evaluated, the
 court found that the legal questions are significant. The court stated
 that "The internet is transforming our economy and culture, and the
 question whether it is covered by the ADA - one of the landmark civil
 rights laws in this country - is of substantial importance."
</p>
<p>  
 "Readers may be interested to know that at this time in the US, our
 courts are split on the purely legal question as to whether or not the
 ADA applies to private web sites. Our case law is behind the times,
 hence the statement by the US Court of Appeals that this is a
 significant legal question.
</p>
<p>  
 "As for government web sites, which are not private or commercial
 web sites, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended
 by the 1998 Rehabilitation Act Amendments, requires US federal
 government web sites be accessible. Today, many states across our
 nation have also adopted Section 508 accessible web design
 requirements, either by statute or by policy. As a result, non-
 governmental organisations using state funding may also be subject to
 the requirements of accessible web design."
</p>
<p>  
 Sailesh Panchang, senior accessibility engineer at Deque Systems in
 Virginia, writes to comment on the same article: "I was distressed to
 note that the bulletin has not correctly portrayed the recent ruling
 regarding Southwest Airlines and the ADA. The decision was largely
 based on procedural grounds and the judge recognised the significance
 of an inaccessible web site (for a media report see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ada1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ada1</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 "I feel such unfair portrayal of facts by your newsletter misinforms
 readers and is a disservice to web accessibility efforts. Additionally,
 the ADA in the US predates the internet and hence makes no
 references to web accessibility. The UK's DDA was passed in 1995
 and could not have ignored the web."
</p>
<h3 id="i59-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Sign Here:</h3>
<p>  Further to our ongoing debate on 'Chip and Pin' bank payment cards, our reader Estelita from Derbyshire writes in to
 respond to Debbie Payne's account of problems with signatures. "I
 understand her feelings as I myself experienced the same," she says.
 "The time came that I had to provide my signature, and my teacher
 suggested using my right thumb mark next to my name printed by
 whoever is there to assist me. This system was accepted in Philippines
 and Canada but here in England, I don't think it is.
</p>
<p>  
 "My thumb mark is easy to use: I have a rubber self-inking name pad
 to stamp my name on, and then I have to ink my thumb to sign. This
 type of signature cannot be forged or stolen. In some cases, Chip and
 Pin appears to be the best solution; so what if keypads are different?
 We can learn different ways of using them and it's not hard to do, just

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Web accessibility- Speech enabling II
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i59-12"><b class="Ps">+</b>12: The Controversial Voice of the Web:</h3>
<p>  Part II. by Julie Hill.
</p>
<p>  
 Our recent discussion about the relative merits of software to "speech-
 enable" web sites (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 57, September 2004)
 provoked responses from vendors and web accessibility experts alike.
</p>
<p>  
 Products such as Browsealoud (<a href="http://www.browsealoud.com">http://www.browsealoud.com</a>
) and ReadSpeaker (<a href="http://www.readspeaker.com">http://www.readspeaker.com</a>
) are available to web site owners to allow their site's content to be "read" to users using a
 computer-generated voice. The web owner pays the service provider an
 annual subscription, while users can access the service for free using a
 browser plug-in.
</p>
<p>  
 In our September article Julie Howell, digital policy development
 officer at the RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
), criticised these text-to- speech solutions as having limited value for blind and visually
 impaired people. She said that they were a "poor substitute for access
 solutions, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers", and that web
 owners would do better to concentrate their accessibility efforts on the
 World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
) guidelines, which are "freely available and have the advantage of opening access to all users, using any
 technology."
</p>
<p>  
 Both vendors interviewed in the original feature, ReadSpeaker and
 Browsealoud, emphasise that their software wasn't intended as a
 substitute for implementing the WAI guidelines. Indeed they say that
 in order for their products to work effectively, a web site has to be
 designed in an accessible way in the first place.
</p>
<p>  
 "ReadSpeaker has the same requirements on accessibility as a screen
 reader," says Carin Lennartsson, head of ReadSpeaker UK. "So it isn't
 a matter of simply adding ReadSpeaker instead of making the site
 compliant with the WAI guidelines."
</p>
<p>  
 Gary Morrison of Texthelp (<a href="http://www.texthelp.com">http://www.texthelp.com</a>
), the company behind Browsealoud, concurs. "The more accessible the web site, the
 more likely it is to be accommodating to assistive technology, such as
 screen readers and text-to-speech software. This means that the blind
 person with software such as JAWS can read the text on a site, as can a
 person with dyslexia with a screen reader like Browsealoud."
</p>
<p>  
 Both companies emphasised that their products weren't intended to
 replace screen readers used by blind and visually impaired people to
 access web sites. "We make it clear that our product isn't aimed
 primarily at the blind and visually impaired communities," says
 Lennartsson. "These people will continue to need screen readers in
 order to access web sites."
</p>
<p>  
 Browsealoud and ReadSpeaker read out web content as the user scrolls
 over it with the cursor. So the fact that users need to be able to find a
 web site in the first place and see the cursor to navigate precludes the
 usefulness of these products for blind people.
</p>
<p>  
 However, both companies cite people with mild visual impairments as
 one of their target groups. Indeed Texthelp says that it modified the
 beta version of Browsealoud in order to make it more user-friendly as a
 result of feedback from visually impaired users. The current version of
 Browsealoud includes a colour highlighter, which highlights the text
 being read out as the user moves their mouse. This feature helps people
 with visual impairments and other users to navigate sites more easily,
 says McKay.
</p>
<p>  
 Meanwhile ReadSpeaker says that its product has been welcomed -
 and in some cases adopted - by blind and visually impaired advocacy
 groups in other countries. For example, Synskadades Riksforbund
 (<a href="http://www.srfriks.org">http://www.srfriks.org</a>
), the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired, uses ReadSpeaker on its web site. "There are many people
 out there who are not our members, but they still have a milder visual
 impairment and may not have access to assistive technology," says
 Vivianne Emanuelsson of Synskadades Riksforbund. "So 'talking' web
 sites can still be of use."
</p>
<p>  
 However, the primary audiences for these technologies, say the
 vendors, are people with dyslexia, people with low literacy and reading
 skills, people whose first language isn't English and anyone else who,
 for whatever reason, might have difficulty browsing and reading
 content online. These target groups constitute a significant proportion
 of web users, says David Sloan of the Digital Media Access Group at
 the University of Dundee (<a href="http://www.dmag.org.uk">http://www.dmag.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p>  
 "I agree [with Julie Howell] wholeheartedly that these solutions are not
 appropriate for people who already use screen reading technology to
 access the web," says Sloan. "However, to discount them as not
 benefiting the accessibility of the web as a whole is, I feel, failing to
 take into account all those other people who can see but have difficulty
 reading on-screen content."
</p>
<p>  
 One of the merits of text-to-speech technologies is that they are free for
 users. Indeed Texthelp says that it originally developed Browsealoud
 as an e-government product, so that citizens from lower socio-
 economic backgrounds with reading or print difficulties would be able
 to access online public services from which they would otherwise be
 excluded.
</p>
<p>  
 The RNIB acknowledges that, unlike user access tools such as screen
 readers which are prohibitively expensive for the majority of blind and
 visually impaired people, the fact that these solutions are available to
 users for free is commendable. However, it is also wary of their
 commercial nature. "The RNIB continues to lobby for web
 accessibility based on the WAI guidelines," says Howell. "They are
 available for free in the public domain and we aren't keen to endorse
 solutions where there is a cost involved."
</p>
<p>  
 In Sloan's view, the proliferation of automated text-to-speech
 solutions, such as Browsealoud and ReadSpeaker, should be
 encouraged, because they contribute towards making the web
 accessible to more people. And they don't have a negative impact on
 traditional access technologies such as screen readers used by blind
 and visually impaired people. "I don't believe that if such solutions
 become more widespread, then screen reader users will be adversely
 affected or forced to use the site's proprietary text-to-speech solution,"
 he says. "In fact, screen reader users may well benefit from being part
 of a larger group who listens to rather than sees web sites."
</p>
<p>  
 However, if competing text-to-speech solutions proliferate, one of the
 dangers is that users will become confused, says Sloan. "There will be
 a lack of standard method for enabling the text-to-speech facility of a
 particular web site," he says. "Where's the button to listen to this page?
 In the top left or top right of the page? What will it look like?"
</p>
<p>  
 One of the RNIB's main concerns is that web owners will see these
 solutions as a quick fix for accessibility. "There is the very real risk
 that some web managers will regard these speech systems as all they
 need to make their web site accessible, ignoring all of the other issues
 that go into making a site truly accessible," said Smillie. Howell
 agrees: "We fear that [text-to-speech software] isn't a complete
 solution and emphasise that it shouldn't act as an alternative to
 following WAI guidelines."
</p>
<p>  
 The vendors maintain that this worry is unfounded, however - not least
 because their technologies only work effectively if the web site
 concerned has already been designed to be compliant with the WAI
 guidelines.
</p>
<p>  
 Howell agrees: "As long as organisations understand the context of
 why WAI is so important, they can add specialist solutions to speech-
 enable web sites for the benefit of wider groups".

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: A Guided Tour Of Pac Mateby John M. Williams
</h3>
<p>  
  The PAC Mate
 (<a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/PACmate2.asp">http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/PACmate2.asp</a>
), a personal data assistant (PDA) for people who are blind, was introduced
 by Freedom Scientific and Microsoft Corporation in October 2002.
 There are two versions of the PAC Mate. The BNS version uses an
 eight-dot Braille keyboard: thus, a user needs familiarity with inputting
 Braille symbols, but does not necessarily need to read print or
 refreshable Braille. The TNS version uses a standard Qwerty keyboard.
</p>
<p>  
 The PAC Mate offers anytime, anywhere access to documents and web
 content through the Windows CE operating system, Microsoft Pocket
 PC technology and JAWS screen reader speech technology. JAWS is
 PAC Mate's backbone.
</p>
<p>  
 The device's screen reader technology allows blind and low-vision
 users to hear documents, images and web content. It integrates with
 desktop software and other Pocket PC devices, takes notes, and allows
 users to make and track appointments in real-time.
</p>
<p>  
 There is a PCMCIA connection for either a dial-up or broadband
 optional modem (56K, Ethernet) or peripheral plug-ins such as a
 micro-drive, diskette drive or CD-ROM. Using a modem, users surf the
 internet and send and receive emails.
</p>
<p>  
 There is a USB port for connection with desktops, laptops, printers and
 other devices in either host or client mode. Other functions include a
 calculator, linear formatting editor, clock and stopwatch. An Infrared
 Data Association (IrDA) port allows the user to transfer files between
 PAC Mate and other PC products. For example, users can transfer an
 Excel worksheet, from their PAC Mate to their desktop or laptop, or
 vice versa. The document exchange can be accomplished wirelessly,
 thus providing document management within the Windows
 environment.
</p>
<p>  
 The PAC Mate accesses streaming media with synthesizer speech on
 the same sound card, so users can listen to internet broadcasts through
 Pocket Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>  
 Braille users can input in Grade 2 Braille, and at the end of 2002,
 Freedom Scientific released the PAC Mate BNS with Braille-in and
 speech-out capabilities and the PAC Mate TNS with speech output.
 These models were followed by 20- and 40-cell refreshable Braille
 options.
</p>
<p>  
 There is a Compact Flash port for unlimited document storage capacity
 when used with commercial data storage cards and a serial port for use
 in those circumstances where a USB and an lrDA are not applicable for
 connectivity.
</p>
<p>  
 How easy is it to learn to use PAC Mate? I am told by Freedom
 Scientific's marketing director Scott Meyers that people familiar with
 the JAWS screen reader and Windows applications such as Word,
 Excel, Internet Explorer and Outlook will require little training to
 become proficient with its use. Meyers concedes that learning curves
 vary from person to person.
</p>
<p>  
 Future PDAs from other companies will have a global positioning
 system (GPS) integrated. Freedom Scientific has already worked with
 VisuAide of Canada for an optional GPS component to provide
 orientation by describing surroundings and assist in directing users to a
 predefined location. The GPS function was made available in 2003.
</p>
<p>  
 The PAC Mate is an excellent product with benefits to blind, vision
 impaired and learning disabled individuals working and studying. In
 fact, it can surpass its promise to play a key role in empowering and
 increasing the productivity of persons with disabilities in the work
 force provided it reaches a wider market and its price drops.
</p>
<p>  
 PAC Mate BNS and TNS both cost 2,595 dollars. This includes the
 carrying case but does not include the modem. Buyers can offset the
 cost by trading in an older model Freedom Scientific notetaker.
 Nevertheless the high price tag prohibits many students and
 professionals with disabilities, as well as schools, from buying the
 product.
</p>
<p>  
 Students with disabilities can gain particular benefits from the PAC
 Mate as it provides them with tools they need to compete in the IT
 field now. While middle grade students without disabilities are already
 using Compaq iPAQs, PalmPilots and other handheld communications
 devices, students with disabilities need access to handheld assistive
 technology such as the PAC Mate sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>  
 The BNS version is approximately 10 inches across at the bottom of
 the unit and approximately 6 inches in height, and weighs a little more
 than 1 and a half pounds with the user-replaceable battery installed.
 The TNS model is 12 inches across and 6 inches in height and weighs
 just more than 2 pounds with the battery. Because both models are
 really too large to fit in a pocket, the name "Pocket PC" is something
 of a misnomer. But the usefulness of the device is unquestionable.
</p>
<p>  
 NOTE: An earlier version of this article was first published by the
 National Organization on Disability web site in the US. John Williams
 is an author and journalist specialising in assistive technologies.
