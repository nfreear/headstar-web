<h3 id="i142-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Disney Web Access Case Settles Before Trial</h3>
<p> 
 A US class action against the Walt Disney Company for the
 alleged inaccessibility of its websites has reached an out of
 court settlement ahead of a trial that had been planned for
 January 2012, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 On 29 June, California district judge Dolly Gee gave
 permission for three blind women from California and Kansas
 to proceed with a class action alleging Disney’s are inaccessible
 to screen reader programs, hampering the ability of blind users
 to make reservations for the company’s theme parks and
 download electronic tickets.
</p>
<p> 
 The three women are represented by Andy Dogali at Florida-
 based law firm Forizs &amp; Dogali, alongside Los Angeles-based
 attorney Eugene Feldman. Dogali has now told E-Access
 Bulletin the terms of a settlement have been agreed by the
 parties, subject to court approval as required by US law.
</p>
<p> 
 “We are presently documenting the settlement, so most of the
 precise details remain confidential, although I expect the
 process to require no more than another few weeks”, he said.
 “The supportive documents will be publicly filed in the very
 near future, along with the request for approval.”
</p>
<p> 
 The news of a pre-trial settlement may disappoint some
 observers, as a January trial would have raised the issue of a
 need for greater corporate web accessibility worldwide. Last
 month Samantha Fothergill, senior legal policy officer at UK
 blindness charity RNIB, said the fact that a company with such
 a high profile was being sued was bound to have an effect on
 corporate behaviour and lobbying campaigns elsewhere (see E-
 Access Bulletin, October 2011
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=633">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=633</a>

<h3 id="i142-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Smartphone App Launches Accessible Loyalty Cards.</h3>
<p> 
 A smartphone app offering digital versions of shop loyalty
 cards will open up card schemes to many disabled people for
 the first time, its developer has said.
</p>
<p> 
 The “mClub” app from print and digital directories company
 Yell – which is free to download –allows retailers to offer
 deals such as “buy nine cups of coffee, get the 10th free”
 without using a physical card. A pilot service – available for
 both the Apple iPhone ( <a href="http://bit.ly/pDmUyC">http://bit.ly/pDmUyC</a>
 ) and Android phones
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/rfB9u6">http://bit.ly/rfB9u6</a>
 ) - has been launched in London, Plymouth and Reading, with a
 BlackBerry service due to be released in the next few weeks.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the service was not originally designed for use by
 disabled people Artur Ortega, senior accessibility developer at
 Yell, told E-Access Bulletin this month that when he saw the
 idea presented internally he immediately saw the potential
 benefits for disabled people, and was able to influence the
 design process.
</p>
<p> 
 “Before, it wasn’t possible for blind people to use loyalty
 cards,” Ortega said. “You couldn’t find the right card in your
 pocket, and you didn’t know how many stamps were on it. The
 app is also useful for someone who has reduced mobility in
 their hands and who might have problems getting a card out of
 their pocket or wallet.”
</p>
<p> 
 Once the app is running, loyalty points are added for each
 participating retailer either by swiping it near a terminal on
 Android phones using near field communication, or by
 scanning a QR code (a square bar code) using the iPhone.
 Although there is a beep emitted when the app is successfully
 swiped, the lack of near–field communication on an iPhone
 was a limitation for blind users unless helped by a shop
 assistant, Ortega acknowledged.
</p>
<p> 
 Running the app itself was not too hard for blind users, with
 iPhones coming pre-installed with VoiceOver text-to-speech
 functionality and Android phones able to run similar software
 such as the Mobile Accessibility suite from Code Factory, he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 This kind of approach, combined with geo-location
 technology, is implemented in the new smartphone version of
 the company’s home page www.yell.com, which is hugely
 liberating for disabled people, Ortega said. “If I need a taxi, I
 can find one immediately and then call the taxi using the same
 device, I don’t have to copy telephone number – it’s two clicks
 away. Or I can order a table in a restaurant – it’s a huge
 advantage for blind people or people with reduced mobility.
</p>
<p> 
 “Before, you had to call someone and ask them to put you
 through to the restaurant. If the line was busy you had to call
 again and ask them to look it all up again.”

<h3 id="i142-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Ict Access Barriers ‘Common Across Europe’.</h3>
<p> 
 The problems encountered in putting ICT accessibility policies
 into practice are common across Europe, according to early
 findings of a survey of policies in 30 nations (the EU
 countries, plus Norway, Iceland and Switzerland), E-Access
 Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 According to research carried out in June for the EU-funded ‘i-
 access’ project on access to electronic information and lifelong
 learning
 (<a href="http://www.european-agency.org/agency-projects/i-access">http://www.european-agency.org/agency-projects/i-access</a>
 ), problems encountered include creating accessible content;
 standards compliance; problems procuring accessible systems;
 and a lack of awareness and understanding.
</p>
<p> 
 The project is run by the European Agency for Development in
 Special Needs Education to raise awareness of the issues
 surrounding accessible information provision for lifelong
 learning. While some survey respondents said their
 organisations provided style guides for creating content, only
 about half of these addressed accessibility aspects such as
 considering how a screen-reader would cope.
</p>
<p> 
 “There are an estimated 80 million people in the EU with
 disabilities of varying sorts and to differing degrees, and as the
 age profile shifts, so too will the proportion with disabilities”,
 John Galloway, a consultant working on dissemination of i-
 access findings told E-Access Bulletin this week. “There is no
 one solution to the issue of ensuring that any information in an
 electronic format, whether a web-page, a text message, an on-
 screen document, or an information film, is available to all of
 them equally,” Galloway said.
</p>
<p> 
 “For each country, we need to find out – what policies do they
 have, and how do they put them into practice? What are the
 differences and similarities? The lessons learned from across
 Europe will be brought together for everyone to share, so this
 difficult issue can be addressed.”
</p>
<p> 
 Full details of the research and a report of a project conference
 co-hosted by the Danish Ministry of Education in Copenhagen
 this June are due to be published shortly, with the final project
 recommendations expected towards next summer, Galloway
 said.

<h3 id="i142-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Voter Aid:</h3>
<p>  Disabled voters in the US state of Oregon are being helped to cast their ballot by adaptable software carried
 on iPads by election workers into locations such as community
 centres and nursing homes. Residents in five of the 36 counties
 of Oregon cast their votes in a special primary election on
 Tuesday to nominate candidates to replace Congressman David
 Wu, who resigned following a sex scandal. Voters with
 disabilities were able to make their selection on-screen using
 screen-readers, adjustable font size and screen colours and
 other accessible features. Once the selection was made ballots
 were printed out to be delivered to the elections office.
 According to media reports if the pilot programme is
 successful, the technology will be made available across the
 whole state in future elections:

<p>  High levels of assistance for disabled customers are being pioneered by the new flagship store for
 mobile network operator O2 in central London. The shop
 offers in-store advice on the benefits that mobile devices such
 as smartphones and their applications, features and functions
 can provide for people with sensory impairments. All staff
 have also received sight loss and deaf awareness training in
 partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB) and consultancy Positive Signs, and the shop is also
 home to O2 “guru” Abigail who is deaf and fluent in BSL.
 Plans are in hand to provide further advice and services for

<p>  Reader Martin Jones writes in with an accessibility complaint about one of the world’s biggest and
 most popular internet sites. He says: “I have been wanting to
 start selling items on eBay, as others have made a substantial
 amount of money, but when I go to list an item, the site is
 virtually inaccessible.
</p>
<p> 
 “I would have thought, with it being probably the largest
 auction site in the world, it would appreciate disabilities and
 have made the site accessible, but this does not seem to be the
 case.
</p>
<p> 
 Can you tell me if there is an accessible programme I can use
 to list my items, as I have heard software exists If not, is there
 anything which can be done to inform eBay and work with
 them to make the site accessible? (I have tried Turbo Lister, but
 have the same problems of inaccessibility).
</p>
<p> 
 I ask, because when I try contacting them, there is either no
 email reply, or the phone line is always engaged. I just thought,
 as eBay is now so popular, if someone has a workaround, then
 others would be grateful of this: if not, then we should do
 something about it, and the more people who are aware, the
 more strength we have.

<h3 id="i142-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: File Fight:</h3>
<p>  Our regular correspondent Fay Rohrlach from South Australia writes in with another major target in her sights:
 the inaccessibility of many pdf files.
</p>
<p> 
 “I'm still fighting to get access to materials of which I want, of
 which many are PDFs, and people are not co-operating to
 change their ways when it comes to making a move to do so”,
 Fay writes.
</p>
<p> 
 “We all want to be part of the community. But the accessibility
 of this, that, or the other, doesn't permit us to do so. I use
 ZoomText, and to bring up anything on the screen that is in
 pdf, the letters are distorted if the magnification is brought up
 too much.
</p>
<p> 
 “I would like to know from anyone as to how can one convert
 pdfs into a word file, particularly into Word 2003, please.
 Some things I've been sent in a word file 2010, which isn't
 accessible. And if there is a way out of it, I'd like to know
 about it. This is 2011, nearly 2012. Why are we still carrying
 on as if we're still living back in the 1950s?
</p>
<p> 
 “I say to any business organisations, and any others concerned,
 it could well be one day, that you may need our services, if
 you can't read for yourselves. All fully sighted users, please,
 change your ways for us, and all other people with disabilities,
 or face the compliance rules that may come in the not too
 distant future.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Forced Choiceby Miro Griffiths.
</h3>
<p> 
 The social model of disability holds that it is socially
 constructed barriers, rather than the impairments of disabled
 people, that limit their opportunities.
</p>
<p> 
 Disabled people are disadvantaged by the way society is
 organised by non-disabled people. Take any issue or area of
 society such as employment, education, housing, transport or
 poverty and you will find that disabled people are more
 disadvantaged than non-disabled people, and that the
 difference cannot be explained or excused by impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 The explanation of this deep rooted “structured disadvantage”
 lie in the social, physical and attitudinal barriers that society
 creates, stopping disabled people from fulfilling their potential
 and from achieving the same life chances as non-disabled
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 ICT is thought to hold great promise for disabled people
 because it has the potential to reduce or eliminate many of the
 disabling barriers that impair or completely prevent disabled
 people from working, learning, shopping, banking, being
 entertained, and communicating with others.
</p>
<p> 
 But many barriers still remain.
</p>
<p> 
 New technologies are constructed, tested and designed for non-
 disabled people. They empower people with new abilities, but
 also rely heavily on the existing ones. Telephones depend on
 the capacity to speak and to listen; computer screens on the
 ability to see; satellite navigation systems on the ability to see
 and to hear. And so on.
</p>
<p> 
 Any new technology brings with it a new power for those who
 can use it, and a new disability for those who cannot.
</p>
<p> 
 How ICT strategy is developed and implemented can mean for
 disadvantaged people the difference between dependency or
 autonomous living.
</p>
<p> 
 I’ve heard the economic argument that disabled people need to
 be “reconceptualised” as a potential market (18% of the
 population) and need to trust the market and industry to
 address accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 However, I reject this business argument and would rather
 assert that the industry needs to embrace the “mind set” of the
 social model of disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The three critical building blocks of this approach are first,
 respect for the human rights of disabled people. For example,
 product developers need to employ disabled people and
 consult actively with the disability community to ensure that
 access is a fundamental part of products.
</p>
<p> 
 Second, respect for personal choice. ICT options must not be
 imposed on disabled people - often choices for
 accommodating impairments are made by a technical
 “expert”—someone who knows the technology options and
 assesses what they believe is best for the user. If only certain
 ICTs are accessible, then disabled people can only choose the
 accessible option – it is a forced choice. Forced choices carry
 with them the message that non-disabled people warrant a full
 range of affordable options, while disabled people only
 deserve the few, often specialised and expensive, options that
 are made available to them.
</p>
<p> 
 And the third building block is development of universal
 design and disability-related supports. Often the solutions
 developed in accordance with the social model of disability
 help not only disabled people but also non-disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, there are differences in how disabled and non-
 disabled can access and use ICTs that may be beyond the reach
 of universal design. These differences create the need for
 disability-related supports, as well as information, training, and
 local support services in order to become successfully
 connected to the digital world. The social model perspective
 holds that society should make necessary supports available to
 people. In this way, disabled people can both enjoy the
 benefits of society and be productive citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 In summary, ICT isn’t the powerful agent of change – it is the
 strategy that is adopted that will be the change agent.
</p>
<p> 
 My personal experience of using ICT during higher education –
 I am a post graduate student studying for a masters in disability
 at Leeds University – has, on balance, been a positive one.
 However, there are a few issues it will be useful to highlight.
</p>
<p> 
 Disability Student Allowance (DSA) funding is supposed to
 help meet the extra course costs students can face as a direct
 result of a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 I am a wheelchair user and have a neuromuscular condition
 associated with muscle weakness from the neck down. When I
 went to have my assessment for DSA I requested several types
 of equipment that were appropriate for my type of impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 The first item I requested was a computer multi-monitor
 application. Typically, a student works surrounded by
 numerous text books to read and reference. In my case I am
 unable to lift, hold or turn the page of book. So I requested this
 piece of kit – three monitors and some software – to flip from
 monitor to monitor to access written material or documents.
 The total cost was about &pound;700. Instead I was given a non-
 mainstream mechanical page turner. It takes up about all the
 available desk space, has limited functionality, costs about
 &pound;2,500, is totally inappropriate and was a “forced choice” as
 described earlier. In the end I had to go out and buy the multi-
 monitors myself.
</p>
<p> 
 Second item was a laptop – I need a laptop that is
 ergonomically suited to my impairment, and requested a model
 that I considered functionally appropriate for my access needs.
 Again, I was given the “forced choice” and subsequently had
 to go out and buy myself a laptop that I was able to access.
</p>
<p> 
 Similarly, I wanted a Kindle so I could access reading material
 while lying on the bed. I spend 14 hours a day sitting in my
 wheelchair and sometimes I would like to study lying down. I
 requested the Kindle because it was lighter and ergonomically
 suited to my impairment. They gave me the heavier Sony
 Reader with the buttons at the top which I couldn’t access.
</p>
<p> 
 I went out and bought a Kindle.
</p>
<p> 
 This illustrates that it is not the ICT that is the problem but has
 more to do with the strategy and the prescriptive approach of
 the “gatekeepers” of the service. Thus the “technical expert”
 knows what’s best for the user.
</p>
<p> 
 Then there was the set book list. All the course material was
 electronically accessible, but most of the set books were not
 accessible, so I was faced with paying somebody to scan my
 purchased books and format them into PDFs. This cost me
 three times the price of each book.
</p>
<p> 
 The point I want to make is that I am not on “equal basis with
 other students”. And many disabled students may well have
 given up the course because of issues of affordability.
</p>
<p> 
 ICT has to be affordable; available; accessible – and
 applicable.
