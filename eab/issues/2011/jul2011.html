<h3 id="i139-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Lack Of Interoperability ‘Is Biggest Accessibility Barrier’.</h3>
<p> 
 The biggest barrier to making make the web more accessible to
 disabled people is interoperability, Sandi Wassmer, member of
 the UK government's e-Accessibility Forum, told delegates at e-
 Access '11 conference in London last month
 (<a href="http://www.headstar.com/eaccess11">http://www.headstar.com/eaccess11</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Interoperability is “about having disparate and diverse devices
 that all communicate with each other,” Wassmer said. “To use
 a non technical way of explaining it, a postage stamp is
 interoperable. We have a system that everyone agrees upon
 around the world. The stamp makes sure your letter gets from
 here to where it's going. It's a system which is different in each
 country, but it is interoperable on a global scale.”
</p>
<p> 
 Without interoperability, inclusive design – creating websites of
 value to everyone - will fail, she said. “We can design
 inclusively all we want, but if I have one device that does one
 thing and you have another that does something different, if
 we don't achieve interoperability, we won't be able to connect.”
</p>
<p> 
 The key to interoperability is the use of the open standards
 created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and its
 accessibility arm, the Web Accessibility initiative (WAI),
 Wassmer said. However, although the consortium’s Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are fairly widely
 followed by web designers and developers, two other key sets
 of guidelines -  the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
 (ATAG) which cover software used to create web content such
 as content management systems, blogs and social media; and
 the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), which cover
 software that displays web content such as web browsers and
 media players, have not yet been widely adopted, she said.
 Instead, the market is allowed to dictate how features are added
 to web browsers or social media networks, for example.
</p>
<p> 
 “People don't really care about [ATAG and UAAG] as it is a
 case of market forces. To me, this is really what needs to be
 resolved before we can have an inclusive web.”
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile a range of new government initiatives relating to
 access to ICT by disabled people were announced at the
 conference by Minister for Culture, Communications and
 Creative Industries Ed Vaizey and his senior digital inclusion
 policy adviser, including a new online forum to discuss key
 issues with government. For coverage from our sister

<h3 id="i139-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Open University Media Player Passes Accessibility Test.</h3>
<p> 
 An online video and audio player being developed by the
 Open University (OU) for its students and the wider learning
 community has successfully passed through a round of
 accessibility testing including testing with deaf and dyslexic
 users, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The generic media player, currently viewable as a ‘work in
 progress’ in alpha or prototype format (
 <a href="http://embed.open.ac.uk/demo?theme=ouice-dark">http://embed.open.ac.uk/demo?theme=ouice-dark</a>
 ), is being developed to allow the distance-learning university  greater
 control over the technology used to access it extensive bank of
 podcast material (<a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk">http://podcast.open.ac.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The OU’s 200,000 students are likely to begin using the player
 on the university’s virtual learning environment by the end of
 this year or the start of next, according to Nick Freear, a web
 developer in the OU’s Institute of Educational Technology. It
 will also feature on ‘OpenLearn’, an open educational
 resources portal where anyone can access hundreds of online
 learning materials for free ( <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility features of the media player including the ability
 to add captions for video, and developers will be able to
 change the look and feel for use on their own websites, Freear
 said. The player is built on Flowplayer, an open source flash
 player which works on both desktop and tablet computers such
 as the Apple iPad, with HTML and Javascript additions, he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Eventually the source code for the accessible player might be
 opened up, Freear said. “but that’s down the line.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Online Book Sets Out Seven Steps To Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 An ‘online book’ setting out the first seven steps that any
 website owner or developer should take towards making their
 site accessible to people with disabilities was unveiled last
 month by the OneVoice for Accessible ICT Coalition, an
 umbrella group of accessibility and technology organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 'The First Seven Steps to Accessible Websites' (
 <a href="http://www.onevoiceict.org/tools/tools/seven-steps">http://www.onevoiceict.org/tools/tools/seven-steps</a>
 ) was launched at the recent e-access 11 conference, co-hosted
 by the coalition with E-Access Bulletin publisher Headstar
 (<a href="http://www.headstar.com/eaccess11">http://www.headstar.com/eaccess11</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The seven were chosen as the most important first practical
 steps that should be taken by most websites, and are all
 relatively easy to implement, the book’s author Peter
 Abrahams, Accessibility Practice Leader at Bloor Research,
 told the conference.
</p>
<p> 
 The steps are grouped into two types, Abrahams said.
</p>
<p> 
 Steps 1, 2 and 3 are ‘setting the scene’ steps. Step 1 is to do a
 quick accessibility check of a website: “We provide a
 methodology for doing that to give you an indication of
 whether your website is very accessible, reasonably accessible,
 partially accessible, or is an absolute nightmare. “ Step 2 is to
 publish an accessibility policy, and Step 3, is to provide a way
 for people to give feedback on any problems encountered.
</p>
<p> 
 The next four steps represent a few basic technical features
 that are most important for accessibility, for example helping
 people who navigate the web using keyboard only or blind
 people using text to speech screen-readers, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Step 4 is providing a ‘jump to content’ link to allow people to
 jump over all the menus, adverts and “rubbish” that can clutter
 up a page and go straight to the main content. Step 5 is ensuring
 the tab sequence – jumping from link to link using the tab key
 – is logical; Step 6 is ensuring that pictures and links have
 alternative text; and step 7 is to ensure that text sizing works.
</p>
<p> 
 The book’s own website features a page for each step with
 background, information about implementation, links to good
 and bad examples, and instructional videos with closed
 captions, Abrahams said. Future plans include similar steps for
 accessibility of other technologies such as smartphones; and
 the building of an online community to discuss the continual
 refinement and development of the project, he said.

<h3 id="i139-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Access Denied:</h3>
<p>  A proposal for a European law on accessible websites has been published by the European
 Disability Forum, an umbrella group of disability organisations
 across Europe, as part of a new campaign on web access,
 ‘Access Denied!’ Joining forces with AGE platform Europe,
 the European Blind Union and ANEC, the European consumer
 voice in standardisation, the forum is calling for the European
 Commission to propose binding EU legislation to ensure that
 public websites and websites delivering basic services of public
 interest are made accessible as soon as possible. The
 commission is due to make an announcement on the
 accessibility of public sector websites and ‘websites providing
 basic services to citizens’ later this year:

 06: Smart Prize: A new European contest to promote the
 development of smartphone applications designed to improve
 the lives of disabled and older people has been launched by
 the Vodafone Foundation. The Smart Accessibility Awards will
 share a 200,000 euro prize fund between the best smartphone
 app in four areas: social participation, including access to
 social media; independent living, for helping users with
 everyday tasks such as opening a door;  mobility, for enabling
 users to travel freely or use location services; and wellbeing,
 for applications which improve the users' health. Entries must
 be in by 15 October to be evaluated in November, with 12
 finalists selected to present their application to a jury in
 Brussels in December at a live final, where the four overall
 winners will be chosen:

<p>  Our long-running debate on the price of access technology continues with a message from Allan Milne,
 Lecturer in Software Engineering at the University of Abertay
 in Dundee,
</p>
<p> 
 “I too agree that &pound;800 for a screenreader is ridiculous, although
 I accept that the development costs are high and the current
 take-up population is low,” Milne says.
</p>
<p> 
 “I am voting with my money and moving from 25 years of
 Microsoft to Apple; I pay exactly the same as any other buyer
 and have free, out-of-the box accessibility through their built-
 in VoiceOver screenreader. I have already got my iPod Touch
 and am now in the throes of getting a Mac Book. However I
 would point out that Apple themselves are not perfect and
 somewhat hypocritical in that their iTunes software is entirely
 inaccessible when used with a Windows screenreader, and they
 do not have an accessible category for their apps.
</p>
<p> 
 “The other major issue I have is that as a software engineer,
 even with accessibility software the development environments
 are themselves often barely accessible, placing another barrier
 to blind people like myself trying to help ourselves by building
 accessible applications.
</p>
<p> 
 “Desktop and mobile platforms can be a great vehicle for
 enablement so come on computer hardware and software
 companies, get your acts together.”

<p>  Jonathan Fisher, a reader from Surrey, writes in to say he will be spreading the messages from new
 work being developed by accessibility consultant and academic
 Dr Howard Leicester, who wrote in our last  issue about his
 project to develop standards for more accessible patient
 records.
</p>
<p> 
 “What a greatly absorbing set of topics are dealt with in the
 latest bulletin,” Fisher writes.
</p>
<p> 
 “As a member of my local hospital’s disability access group,
 Ashford and St. Peter’s Foundation Trust, I am motivated to
 pass on the comments about patient information. I will be
 forwarding this bulletin to employed colleagues of this group.
</p>
<p> 
 “Like so many things, it seems to me that there are too many
 folks out there all trying to invent their own shaped wheel. As
 Surrey is a neighbouring county to Kent, it makes sense to me
 to try and promote collaboration.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Prospects Brighten For Copyright Exception Treatyby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 The prospect of agreement on an international treaty to allow
 accessible versions of copyrighted works to be shared across
 borders, giving people with print disabilities wider access to
 books, has brightened following a recent meeting of the World
 Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).
</p>
<p> 
 At a specially-extended June session in Geneva of the
 organisation’s standing committee on copyright and related
 rights (SCCR), WIPO member states agreed to merge
 previously separated formal positions on the issue into a single
 draft document, clearing the way for treaty negotiations later
 this year, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Before the meeting, discussion of the issue had been
 fragmented between four draft texts developed separately by
 the World Blind Union; a grouping of African countries; the
 EU; and the US. In the run-up to the June meeting, the WBU
 had facilitated the merger of these documents into a single new
 draft.
</p>
<p> 
 “That was a big success, as countries were no longer defending
 their own proposals,” Dan Pescod, WBU Vice Chair, told E-
 Access Bulletin this month. “We are pleased with the text –
 negotiation by committee is always a compromise, but we are
 80% of the way towards an acceptable final text of a law.”
</p>
<p> 
 Areas of compromise in drawing up the single text include a
 softer wording on the relationship between the new copyright
 exception law and contract law, Pescod said. “We wanted
 something that made it very clear that contract law could not
 undermine copyright exceptions, but it has been left somewhat
 open to interpretation in the new text as currently worded,” he
 said. “It has left it to member states to decide how they address
 this issue, whereas the WBU does not want any rights-holder to
 be able to draw up a contract which removes the copyright
 exception.”
</p>
<p> 
 Another ongoing area of debate is the issue of which
 organisations will be permitted to send digital files across
 borders under the copyright exception, Pescod said.
</p>
<p> 
 Some rightsholder groups want a system of formal
 requirements to determine who can become such ‘trusted
 intermediaries’, and also which books can be sent and which
 ones can’t, he said. But the WBU would prefer a less formal
 system whereby ‘authorised entities’ would not have to be pre-
 approved, or gain fresh permission each time for individual
 titles.
</p>
<p> 
 The discussion now moves on to the next SCCR meeting on 21
 November, where the detail of the final text could be decided,
 and a decision taken as to whether it will become a full
 international treaty or simply a ‘recommendation’.
</p>
<p> 
 The EU has been the biggest block on creation of a full treaty
 (see E-access Bulletin, April issue
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=581">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=581</a>
 ), with strong pressure from rightsholders in countries including France  to
 resist any systematic exceptions to copyright law.
</p>
<p> 
 But this would represent double standards, Pescod said. “In the
 very same committee meeting this June, WIPO Member States
 agreed that a treaty on the protection of audiovisual
 performances should be concluded. We do not think print
 disabled people deserve a lesser solution.”
