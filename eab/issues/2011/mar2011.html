<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Report Highlights Research Gaps For AssistiveTechnology.
</h3>
<p> 
 Lack of awareness of the needs of users with disabilities;
 funding problems; user-testing problems and problems with
 ensuring use of open standards are all among barriers to
 successful transfer of new assistive technologies from the
 research laboratory to the real world, a new report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 The report was written by consultant Dr John Gill for the
 Cardiac project, a European initiative to identify research and
 development gaps in the fields of accessible and assistive ICT (
 <a href="http://www.cardiac-eu.org">http://www.cardiac-eu.org</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The project covers two main areas: transferring assistive
 devices from the laboratory to wide availability; and
 encouraging the introduction of more mainstream products and
 services which are usable by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “In the area of assistive technology for people with disabilities,
 many devices have been developed, some of which were
 successful, but most have failed to make the transition from
 the laboratory to being generally available at affordable
 prices”, the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 Problems have included:
</p>
<p> 
 - Assistive devices are often required in relatively small
 quantities, but modern production techniques require large
 quantities to keep prices low;
</p>
<p> 
 - Manufacturers often insist on using proprietary protocols,
 whereas users would prefer systems based on open standards
 to avoid supplier lock-in; and
</p>
<p> 
 - Widespread lack of awareness of accessibility issues among
 product and service design teams.
</p>
<p> 
 Organisations representing people with disabilities seldom join
 discussions on research priorities since they lack people with
 the skills to understand the potential of new developments to
 help people with disabilities, the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 There is also a catch-22 situation regarding commercial risk:
 “Companies in the disability area tend to be risk-averse, so
 prefer to update an existing product rather than market a truly
 innovative concept”, it says. “New concepts may not get
 subsidised until such time that they have significant market
 penetration, but the market may not exist until a subsidy is
 available.
</p>
<p> 
 “Therefore, many projects are based on incremental
 improvements of available technology and produce only
 marginal advantages for end users [whereas] It is ... necessary
 to encourage research projects that are based on real
 technological innovations and produce significant advantages
 for users.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Council Web Access ‘Should Be Built Into Procurement’.</h3>
<p> 
 Website accessibility should be built into local authority
 software and IT systems procurement criteria, the leading
 annual review of all UK council websites has found.
</p>
<p> 
 More local authorities should also carry out user-testing on
 their websites using groups of people with disabilities,
 according to Better Connected 2011 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/hBOGUw">http://bit.ly/hBOGUw</a>
 ), conducted by the public sector Society of IT Management
 (Socitm).
</p>
<p> 
 A direct accessibility test was carried out for the survey of all
 433 UK council websites, based on the World Wide Web
 Consortium’s international Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG).
</p>
<p> 
 Using these guidelines, just 30 councils (7%) achieved the
 basic ‘Level A’ standard, compared with a similar number – 32
 – in 2010. As in previous years, no council achieved ‘Level
 AA’ – the standard which the previous government encouraged
 all councils to reach.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the tests continue to use version 1.0 of WCAG (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/cmbc4g">http://bit.ly/cmbc4g</a>
 ), the report says it is likely to switch to use of the newer version 2.0 guidelines for next year’s survey.
</p>
<p> 
 As in previous years the Royal National Institute of Blind
 People (RNIB), which advises Socitm on accessibility, carried
 out its own separate qualitative assessment for the survey on all
 sites that passed an automated test. This year, some 241
 councils (56%) were rated by RNIB as satisfactory or excellent
 using this follow-up assessment of accessibility, compared with
 only 187 (43%) in 2010.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Empowering Potential Of Technology Celebrated.</h3>
<p> 
 A new awards event aims to recognise the ability of computers,
 the internet and assistive technology to improve the lives of
 people with disabilities and empower vulnerable sections of
 society.
</p>
<p> 
 Organised by disability and ICT charity AbilityNet (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/himPdh">http://bit.ly/himPdh</a>
 ) and supported by organisations including BT, Microsoft and Race Online 2012, the first
 Technology4Good awards ( <a href="http://bit.ly/gwQUvZ">http://bit.ly/gwQUvZ</a>
 ) are looking for examples of charities, businesses, government
 organisations and individuals that have used digital technology
 to improve the work and home lives of others, including
 disabled people, the elderly and young children. Two
 Accessibility Awards are featured in the seven categories.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin’s sister publication (E-
 Government Bulletin: <a href="http://bit.ly/aKaTdz">http://bit.ly/aKaTdz</a>
 ), Mark Walker of AbilityNet said that the event has two main aims: “The first is
 to share stories about what works. It’s a good chance for
 people to share knowledge and experience. Secondly, it’s a
 chance to inspire other people.”
</p>
<p> 
 At a recent launch event for the awards, a blind member of
 AbilityNet gave a demonstration of how his smartphone helped
 him to navigate and organise parts of his life on a daily basis.
 “I’m sure lots of people have gone away and shared that
 story”, said Walker. “The inspiration you get from hearing
 about how other people have succeeded is a big part of what
 we’re trying to do as well.”
</p>
<p> 
 Nominations for all the Technology4Good Awards (whose
 judging panel will feature members of AbilityNet, Microsoft,
 BT and Martha Lane Fox – the UK’s Digital Champion) are
 now open, and entrants may nominate themselves or others
 before the 9 May deadline. The results will be announced on 7
 June.

<h3 id="i135-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Copyright Controversy:</h3>
<p>  Continuing European Union and US opposition to a proposed law by the World Intellectual
 Property Organisation (WIPO), which would allow people with
 print disabilities to share copyrighted works across international
 boundaries has been labelled as “rigid, insensitive and short-
 sighted”, by a former Member of the European Parliament for
 Spain. The WIPO proposal has been under discussion for
 several years, and had seemed to be edging forwards, though
 any clear agreement is still some way off (see E-Access
 Bulletin issue 131: <a href="http://bit.ly/eNgEDt">http://bit.ly/eNgEDt</a>
 ). David Hammerstein made the comments in an outspoken interview with a US
 website, in which he said the “EU-US coalition” has not put
 forward any solid economic or legal reasons for their
 opposition:

 NFB had previously expressed its support for the ‘Google

<p>  In last week’s inbox, Brian Gaff of Kingston upon Thames Talking Newspaper wrote in to bemoan
 the current government spending cuts, and suggested that two
 creators of free or open source screenreader software were
 being forced to scale back their operations as a result. However
 Roger Wilson-Hinds, director of one of the two firms
 mentioned, Screenreader.net, writes in to say: “I was very
 surprised to read in the February issue that we are cutting back
 our free screenreader development due to lack of cash.
</p>
<p> 
 “Actually, the opposite is the truth and there has never been
 more demand for free Thunder talking software.
</p>
<p> 
 “What we are really doing is moving into the smart phone
 sector with a plan to create some useful apps, low cost and
 aimed at perhaps a wider audience than merely those who can’t
 see. More about all this at a later date, but we are certainly not
 cutting back.”

<h3 id="i135-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Priced Out of the Market?</h3>
<p>  by David Bates.
</p>
<p> 
 There is now increasing emphasis on enabling more of the
 older and poorer members of the community to use computers
 to access information and to communicate with others. I see
 the primary need for non-computer-literate older people to be
 an inexpensive ‘net book’ with a very simple and easily-
 learned interface which will enable them to undertake basic
 tasks. But from where can such machines be purchased with
 suitable, simple software installed?
</p>
<p> 
 Like a new driver, learners are easily put off by technicalities –
 they just want to move forward by operating the controls
 without learning what goes on under the bonnet. This problem
 is especially acute for blind computer users, who have to
 control the machine in an unusual way: because they cannot
 read the text or see the cursor they must move it around the
 screen with the Alt, arrow and Tab keys, and then listen to the
 words under the cursor as they are read out with a synthetic
 voice. The link they require may be very visible on the screen,
 but it may well take the carefully listening user many
 keystrokes to locate it.
</p>
<p> 
 Many blind users consider themselves tied to Microsoft
 programmes and to Freedom Scientific, the company which
 makes the popular JAWS screenreader software which is
 optimised to read these programmes. These two brand leaders
 provide a first-class, premium-priced service for blind people
 in paid employment, but their sales policies largely exclude the
 needs of the great majority of blind people who are
 unemployed or retired.
</p>
<p> 
 Since my retirement I have continued to use Microsoft XP,
 Office 97, Outlook Express and JAWS, while working for two
 charitable organisations. However, I recently had to buy a new
 computer which came with Windows 7 and Office 2007
 because the older programmes have been withdrawn.
</p>
<p> 
 Without the traditional fixed menus, the new programmes are
 much more difficult to use with a screenreader. To allow me to
 continue my work, Microsoft has therefore forced me to
 undertake a considerable and unnecessary learning curve, and
 they have also charged me for the privilege of doing this!
</p>
<p> 
 However, the crowning insult was that the JAWS upgrade
 needed to access these programmes would have cost me &pound;330
 ($500), which would have meant that the new unnecessary
 software programmes would have cost more than the computer
 itself. You need to be rich to be blind!
</p>
<p> 
 I have decided that if I must go through future learning curves I
 will move to open source programmes which are regularly
 updated for free and which will remain available. I have
 therefore replaced JAWS with NVDA ( <a href="http://www.nvda-">http://www.nvda-</a>
 project.org/ ), a free screenreader which is easy to learn and
 works as well as JAWS. My email client is now Mozilla
 Thunderbird, with Firefox replacing Internet Explorer, and I am
 now checking a free office programme so that I can get away
 from Microsoft Word with its less accessible ribbon menus.
</p>
<p> 
 Replacing the Windows operating system will need more care,
 but there are several free Linux operating systems out there
 whose developers could hopefully produce a simple desktop
 interface which will work with their vast assortment of free
 programmes, which, surprisingly, also includes a screenreader.
</p>
<p> 
 Blind people mostly have incomes well below the average, and
 government cuts are likely to reduce these still further, while
 also increasing the rate of unemployment among the blind to
 above the present level of around 65%.
</p>
<p> 
 The open source community should be encouraged to adapt
 and supply their software to this low cost market, thereby
 providing enormous benefits to both older and disabled
 members of the community, a market which appears to be
 outside the financial scope of both Microsoft and Freedom
 Scientific.
