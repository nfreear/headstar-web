<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Uk Charity Investigates Options To Back Disney Webcase.
</h3>
<p> 
 The UK’s leading charity supporting blind and partially sighted
 people RNIB is investigating whether people in the UK might
 be able to join a US class action against the Walt Disney
 Company for the alleged inaccessibility of its websites, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 On 29 June, California district judge Dolly Gee gave
 permission for three blind women - two from Southern
 California and one from Wichita, Kansas - to proceed with a
 class action against Disney alleging the company’s websites
 unlawfully include information which is visible to sighted users
 but not to screen reader programs, as well as options which are
 inaccessible to blind people such as the ability to make
 reservations and download electronic tickets.
</p>
<p> 
 Web accessibility is just one of five main areas of complaint
 being brought in the case, with others including issues in the
 theme parks themselves such as a lack of Braille maps. The
 plaintiffs are not seeking money damages, simply an injunction
 requiring Disney to comply with the Americans with
 Disabilities Act by making its services accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 In her ruling judge Gee rejected as irrelevant arguments by
 Disney that the women could have accessed the same services
 and information elsewhere, and also rejected arguments that
 “there is no accepted accessibility standard”. In dismissing the
 latter argument she pointed out that nearly three years ago —
 &quot;presumably when website accessibility standards were even
 less settled&quot; – a similar action was allowed to proceed against
 the US retailer Target for alleged accessibility problems with its
 website Target.com (see
 <a href="http://www.forizs-">http://www.forizs-</a>

 dogali.com/pdf/Disney%20Certification%20Order.pdf ).
</p>
<p> 
 The three women are represented by Andy Dogali at Florida-
 based law firm Forizs &amp; Dogali ( <a href="http://www.forizs-dogali.com/">http://www.forizs-dogali.com/</a>

 ), alongside Los Angeles-based attorney Eugene Feldman (
 <a href="http://www.californiadisabilitylawfirm.com/">http://www.californiadisabilitylawfirm.com/</a>
 ), with the case set for trial in Los Angeles in January 2012.
</p>
<p> 
 Talking to E-Access Bulletin this week Samantha Fothergill,
 senior legal policy officer at RNIB, said she had contacted the
 US lawyers handling the case to see if UK citizens could
 potentially play any part in adding an international dimension
 to the case.
</p>
<p> 
 “There is no recourse under UK law for the websites as you
 can only sue a website under the Equality Act if the provider is
 established in the UK, but because this is an international
 tourist attraction people from around the world, including
 Britain, could potentially be part of the US case.
</p>
<p> 
 “If so we might be able to find clients who had gone to those
 resorts, and could make people aware this action is going on –
 we would not be encouraging them to join, just passing on the
 information.”
</p>
<p> 
 UK class actions are rare in the field of disability law,
 Fothergill said, not least because all such cases tend to be
 settled out of court.
</p>
<p> 
 “Class actions are often used here in product liability cases but
 disability lawyers don’t often think in that way. We’ve looked
 at possibility of class actions but the cases that we have always
 get settled, so we’ve never really got to that stage.”
</p>
<p> 
 Whatever happens, the fact that a company with such a high
 profile worldwide is being sued anywhere is bound to have an
 effect on corporate behaviour and lobby campaigns elsewhere,
 she said.
</p>
<p> 
 “The Target case got more publicity probably among IT
 professionals than it necessarily did among blind people, but
 this case is more likely to raise the profile of access issues with
 those responsible for services and websites around the world,
 which can only be a good thing wherever you are.”
</p>
<p> 
 Disney is connected with a huge range of public-facing
 websites including sites for media partners ESPN and the ABC
 television network.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Digital Inclusion Course Closure ‘Sets Dangerousprecedent’.
</h3>
<p> 
 The closure by Middlesex University of the first ever European
 MSc course in digital inclusion after just one year of operation
 sets a “dangerous precedent” for those trying to establish a
 business case for accessibility, the academic leading the course
 has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The unique two-year part-time course was launched by
 Middlesex last year. Its curriculum included the social, ethical
 and business case for accessibility; regulations and
 standardisation; web accessibility; and inclusive user
 experience. The course’s overall goal was to improve
 participation in the digital society by older and disabled people
 as well as people at social disadvantage such as unemployed
 people, people on low incomes and those with low literacy.
</p>
<p> 
 However after just eight people joined the programme the
 university has decided that no more will now be taken on and
 the course will close when the current set of students – who
 include four public sector workers – have graduated. To make
 the course financially sustainable a minimum of 20 students a
 year would have been needed.
</p>
<p> 
 Gill Whitney, digital inclusion programme leader at Middlesex,
 told E-Access Bulletin the lack of demand for the course
 signalled a serious problem for the development of accessible
 digital services in the UK and beyond.
</p>
<p> 
 “Losing the MSc programme due to low student numbers sets a
 dangerous precedent - if there is truly no demand, then there is
 no business case for offering similar specialist programmes
 elsewhere”, Whitney said.
</p>
<p> 
 “Designing and developing more accessible systems depends
 on having suitable training or education courses in place for
 those involved in all aspects of the development process”, she
 said.  “The essential element is to convince students of the
 value of taking such courses, for example better job
 opportunities for both students and disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 “There is now recognition of e-accessibility at a political level,
 with the government setting up an e-accessibility forum, but we
 also need industry, not-for-profits and government bodies to
 demonstrate there is a market demand and that there will be
 better jobs for professionals who genuinely understand the
 complexities of delivering accessible ICT, systems and
 services.”
</p>
<p> 
 Whitney said options other than the MSc course could also
 play a role in the educational mix, such as better integration of
 accessibility issues into mainstream technology courses or
 offering short professional development courses or diplomas
 that enhance existing skills. But whatever the solutions, action
 was needed to ensure student demand, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There is a strong need for this sort of training to make
 accessibility happen.”
</p>
<p> 
 One of the course’s students, Big Lottery Fund head of new
 media Claudio Concha, said the course had already proven
 valuable in his work.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Inclusive design is pretty much taken for granted in
 architecture and product design, yet online content and digital
 channels still suffer from a lack of user-centred development
 and there is a complete lack of consideration for disabled and
 older people,” Concha said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;This course has helped me understand the gulf that exists
 between content producers and organisations on one side and
 the reality of customers with differing needs on the other. It
 has allowed me to influence design and development projects
 with an authority that comes with real experience.&quot;

<h3 id="i141-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Rnib To Launch Largest Ever Web Testing Exercise.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB is set to conduct its largest ever manual website
 accessibility testing exercise later this year, when it will check
 all 433 UK local authority sites against a specially-devised set
 of criteria.
</p>
<p> 
 The project will form the charity’s latest contribution to the
 annual ‘Better Connected’ review of UK council websites
 conducted by the public sector Society of IT Management
 (Socitm).
</p>
<p> 
 In previous years RNIB has run initial automated accessibility
 tests on all the sites, only carrying out more detailed manual
 assessment on those passing a certain threshold. This year,
 however, it will carry out manual checks on all sites based on
 attempts to perform three practical tasks on each such as
 paying council tax or renewing a library book online. A few
 other random top level pages will also be checked.
</p>
<p> 
 Marco Ranon, Principal Web Accessibility Consultant at RNIB,
 told a recent Socitm seminar in London the tests would not use
 a checklist approach against all the principles of the
 internationally accepted ‘WCAG [web content accessibility
 guidelines] 2.0’. Instead, though the guidelines would be used
 as a reference, the performance of tasks would be rated from
 0-3 against 14 criteria such as presence of ; unique and
 informative page titles; and clear labels on forms, Ranon said.
 Some criteria such as the presence of keyboard shortcuts for
 tasks would be considered essential “showstoppers”, whose
 absence would spell failure of the test as a whole – again with
 close reference to WCAG, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 “Web accessibility is not about going through every page,
 unless you have a very small website,” Ranon told E-Access
 Bulletin this week.” You have templates and then try to
 educate content people. This is the largest group exercise we do
 as a team, and conformance testing with WCAG 2 takes a long
 time, so it was not practical.”
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Better Connected’ reviews are carried out in November and
 December, with all results including accessibility test results
 due to be published at the end of February 2012.

<p>  Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, who is on the committee of the Kingston upon Thames Association
 for the Blind, writes in to grumble about accessibility issues
 relating to Google services.
</p>
<p> 
 “Judging by the comments in the Google group ‘accessible’ it
 seems that Google have painted themselves into a corner with
 their new online apps like Google Plus and Google Docs,” Gaff
 says. “Half of them won't work with most basic screenreaders
 and so they add ChromeVox to their Chrome browser. Hardly
 what blind folk would want, to have to alter access technology
 just to use Google’s stuff.
</p>
<p> 
 “The failing here surely is that the folk writing the code are not
 aware enough of what works and what does not for blind
 access. It’s sad that in this age we are still saying that the
 writers of code are not educated in making sites that just work
 out of the box, so to speak.
</p>
<p> 
 “Surely in this age when people want more users to generate
 more revenue, it ought to be a no-brainer to get as many folk as
 possible to be able to use web sites, software and online
 systems, but it seems it’s not. We are invisible I suspect.
</p>
<p> 
 “I block Google’s ads now as they persist in trying to sell me
 Venetian blinds... grin.”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Opinion- Accessible kids’ computer games.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Serious Funby Donna Jodhan.
</h3>
<p> 
 Each time I hear those commercials on TV of kids having fun
 with learning games, I ask myself how much of this is or can
 be available to blind and sight-impaired children. The truth is
 that, as modern technology develops, we find that more and
 more blind children are struggling to keep up when it comes to
 being able to enjoy the excitement and fun.  But with more and
 more toy manufacturers coming out with nifty ways for kids to
 learn to read, write, do maths and spell, blind and sight-
 impaired kids need to be given ways to enjoy all of this as well.
</p>
<p> 
 It’s true that some major strides have been made in making
 mainstream games – whether educational or otherwise – more
 available and accessible to blind and sight-impaired kids but
 there is a great deal more that needs to be done.  Blind and
 sight-impaired kids need to be able to access more mainstream
 technology. In short, they need to have equal access to
 whatever game or learning tool is out there for the mainstream
 kid.
</p>
<p> 
 Some strides have been made in the area of ball games; a
 beeping baseball or hockey puck, a beeping ball for lawn
 tennis, and look how Goalball has been developed for blind
 people. So all is not lost.
</p>
<p> 
 So progress continues to be made.
</p>
<p> 
 For example Spoonbill Software, run by “happily retired
 computer programmer” Ian Humphreys in Albany, Western
 Australia, now offers some 18 free computer games for
 sighted, vision-impaired and blind players. The Spoonbill’s
 newest accessible game, BG Codebreaker, substitutes all the
 letters of the alphabet with numbers and then invites you to
 decode words. You can browse all 18 game descriptions here:
 <a href="http://www.spoonbillsoftware.com.au/blindgamers.htm">http://www.spoonbillsoftware.com.au/blindgamers.htm</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Other useful sites include AudioGames.net, a portal for games
 based entirely on sound:
 <a href="http://www.audiogames.net">http://www.audiogames.net</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Accessible chess puzzles, hosted by Mario Lang:
 <a href="http://delysid.org/chess/epd.cgi">http://delysid.org/chess/epd.cgi</a>

</p>
<p> 
 And One Switch, a gaming resource for people with physical
 and learning disabilities:
 <a href="http://www.oneswitch.org.uk">http://www.oneswitch.org.uk</a>

</p>
<p> 
 So can we allow ourselves to dream and hope that the blind
 children of tomorrow will have a better opportunity to move a
 bit closer to the mainstream world of games and toys?  That
 they will have more to choose from and that they will be able
 to enjoy them that much more?  Will they have a greater
 chance to participate in mainstream fun or will they continue to
 lag behind and need substitute games and toys?
</p>
<p> 
 I am sure that as time goes on, more and more toys and games
 manufacturers will develop products that are more accessible.
 Products that will benefit all kids. This may even be closer to
 becoming a reality than many would think, though we can lend
 a hand by lobbying these companies to move in the right
 direction.
