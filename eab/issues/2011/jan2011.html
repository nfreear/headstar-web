<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Canadian Government Appeals Landmark AccessibilityRuling.
</h3>
<p> 
 The Canadian Federal Government is appealing against the
 recent court ruling which branded its websites not fully
 accessible to disabled citizens and ordered it to remedy the
 problem.
</p>
<p> 
 As previously reported in E-Access Bulletin ( see issue 132:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=511">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=511</a>
 ), Donna Jodhan, a blind accessibility consultant, successfully sued the
 government over the inaccessibility of its websites after she
 was unable to apply for a government job online or access
 certain other information.
</p>
<p> 
 In December, a judge ruled in favour of Jodhan, finding the
 Canadian Government had infringed the Canadian Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms by failing to make its websites fully
 accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The government is now appealing against this ruling, claiming
 that the judge exceeded his jurisdiction in finding a “system-
 wide failure” of government through its websites, when it was
 only Jodhan who was proved to be directly affected. The
 government is also claiming the judge “erred in law” by
 ordering it to ‘remedy’ the websites of 146 government
 agencies, when only 106 agencies used the website guidelines
 (‘Common Look and Feel Standards 1.0’) which were found to
 provide inadequate accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 A hearing for reconsideration filed by the Canadian
 Government will take place on 8 February via a video
 conference. “We are still awaiting their official documents to
 see exactly what they are appealing but it appears that they are
 appealing the judge’s entire decision,” Jodhan told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan, who will be opposing the appeal, told E-Access
 Bulletin that it was “very sad and disappointing” that the
 government had chosen to take this course of action. “When
 the Canadian Government decides to waste more precious
 taxpayers’ funds and time fighting something that they should
 have been addressing all along, what does it really say? The
 longer they take to start working with us to fix this problem, the
 longer it would be before we can look forward to having
 accessibility become a reality” she said.
</p>
<p> 
 It is currently unclear whether the government will be making
 any of the ordered changes to its websites before the appeal.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: ‘Wayfinding’ Systems Not Yet Cost-Effective, ReportFinds.
</h3>
<p> 
 The installation of digital ‘wayfinding’ technologies to help
 blind people find their way around railways stations and other
 public spaces might not be cost-effective for five years or
 more, a leading expert has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr John Gill, a consultant and former RNIB chief scientist, was
 speaking following the publication of a report on the operation
 and management of wayfinding systems by the Rail Safety and
 Standards Board, a non-profit rail industry body (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/fQIyeW">http://bit.ly/fQIyeW</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The independent report assessed the benefits, costs, and
 practicability of a pilot installation in Scotland of one leading
 wayfinding system, RNIB ‘React’, a talking sign system
 whereby audio messages are triggered by users carrying a
 special trigger fob when they approach.
</p>
<p> 
 It found that while benefits were demonstrated, there were
 problems with planning, implementing and maintaining the
 React system cost-effectively: current estimated costs for
 implementing such a system across the entire UK rail network
 are between &pound;250 million and &pound;500 million.
</p>
<p> 
 Given this size of cost, “only those systems which provide
 some benefits to the wider rail-travelling community (as
 opposed to only the visually-impaired) look likely to be even
 worth considering”, the report says. In the meantime, the
 provision of extra staff to assist people with disabilities might
 be more cost-effective, as such staff would also be able to
 undertake other tasks, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr Gill, who contributed to the report on the potential benefits
 of future technologies in this field such as radio frequency tags
 (RFID), smartcards and satellite location systems, said in time
 cheaper technologies could be developed combining
 positioning systems with live train information accessed over
 the web.
</p>
<p> 
 “With live information over the web, then you can spread the
 costs, and be useful for all customers,” he said. “At the present
 time the technologies which would be needed are available but
 not widely implemented, but in five years’ time, the story
 might be very different.”
</p>
<p> 
 The problems with implementing systems like React were not
 just related to technology but maintenance, he said.  “You need
 systems to see if it is working reliably. If there is a talking sign
 on the end of a platform saying don’t walk any further, and it’s
 not working, is actually creating a safety hazard. Any system
 has got to work 99.9% of time, so you can rely on it.”
</p>
<p> 
 The decision on when to make investments in wayfinding
 technologies is ultimately a political one, Dr Gill said. “It’s a
 matter of who is going to pay, and who else is going to benefit.
 The rate of change of technology and economics is so fast that
 one hesitates to predict exactly when it will work out.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: European Accessibility Act To Be Unveiled In 2012.</h3>
<p> 
 A proposal for a ‘European Accessibility Act’, which will
 include accessibility measures on ICT and websites, will be put
 forward during 2012, European Commission Vice-President
 Viviane Reding has confirmed.
</p>
<p> 
 The act, part of actions following on from a wider European
 Disability Strategy ( <a href="http://bit.ly/fDCRlP">http://bit.ly/fDCRlP</a>
 ) unveiled last year, will be based on an upcoming commission study of
 accessibility barriers for disabled citizens across Europe. The
 study will cover access to public services, public buildings and
 transport, as well as other areas.
</p>
<p> 
 Reding unveiled the proposals at a meeting of the Disability
 Intergroup, a long-standing grouping of MEPs working to
 promote disability policy, in Brussels earlier this month. The
 act will set out contain common standards to help regulate
 accessible design in a number of areas including ICT, the built
 environment and product design.
</p>
<p> 
 Reding said that she hopes these European standards will help
 pave the way for the development of wider global accessibility
 standards.

<p>  A new ‘app’ for the iPhone and iPad allows parents and carers of children who are unable to speak
 to take pictures of objects and situations and record
 accompanying verbal phrases, to aid communication. These
 notes then become ‘buttons’ on the screen, which children can
 then select and to show people when they want to ask for
 something. ‘Verbal Victor’ can be purchased through the
 iTunes store for $6.99:

<p>  David Bates, a member of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) UK Executive, writes to ask
 advice on free or open source software to convert Word files
 to audio formats.
</p>
<p> 
 “We send out many articles and reports every month to our
 members in all formats, but the majority of these are in audio,
 being first recorded by reading text into a microphone.
</p>
<p> 
 “To save time, we need a programme which will turn Word
 documents into WAV, MP3 or DAISY files. I know we can
 buy a suitable programme from Dolphin for &pound;180, but as we
 are really short of funds I wonder if there is a suitable Open
 Source programme which will do the job? Any help would be
 gratefully received!”
</p>
<p> 
 David also notes that open source software can often do a
 good job in other areas of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 “I am still using JAWS for Windows 5.0, but upgrading to the
 latest version will cost me about the same as buying a new
 computer. I’m trying out [the screenreader] NVDA with IBM
 Lotus Symphony instead of Word plus JAWS. I’m very
 impressed with both of these programmes, which are free, and
 feel that Freedom Scientific are losing out by forcing out
 established users by not offering ‘lite’ or earlier versions of
 JAWS at a lower price.”

<p>  Brian Gaff of the Kingston upon Thames Talking Newspaper, Kingston upon Thames
 Association for the Blind ( <a href="http://kingston.talking-">http://kingston.talking-</a>
 newspapers.co.uk ), writes in to add his support for the
 growing field of free, cheap and open source access solutions.
</p>
<p> 
 “I think there is very little publicity for the free screenreaders
 that are about,” he writes. “If those government folk put a
 small bit of dosh into either or both Thunder (
 http://www.screenreader.net/ ) and NVDA ( <a href="http://www.nvda-">http://www.nvda-</a>
 project.org/ ), to get anything they wanted added, they could
 really save a lot of money getting blind people online.
</p>
<p> 
 “Of the Two, I think Thunder is more hand-holding, but
 NVDA is more powerful, and gives access to Thunderbird and
 other Mozilla applications as well. NVDA is also open source
 so others can fiddle with it should they have the inclination.”
</p>
<p> 
 Brian also laments a common failure to recycle old computers
 which could be of real use to help people who are not yet
 online. “There are lots of perfectly workable computers,
 dumped every day, when for what most want, they could be
 used easily. I’d also like to see some no-fuss, no-threat demos
 done in blind clubs etc, around the country, with a little carrot
 of, ‘oh, do you have relatives in (insert country here)...’
</p>
<p> 
 “In many cases, the fear of computers is all there is.”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Opinion- The future of accessibility.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>Nby Donna Jodhan.
</h3>
<p> 
 As I sit here in my favourite chair listening to the cold
 Canadian winter wind beat softly against my windows, I am
 aware that snowflakes are falling gently outside, and I can hear
 the crunch of boots against firmly-packed snow on the ground.
 It’s time for me to start imagining and dreaming; maybe it’s the
 time of year that does this to me, but boy, is it fun to do.
</p>
<p> 
 This evening, I am going to use the flickering lights of my
 Christmas tree to help put me in the mood and I would like to
 dream a bit about what it could be like for blind people if
 access technology were able to communicate more effectively
 with mainstream technology, as well as with websites.
</p>
<p> 
 There’s no harm in dreaming, and one never knows what could
 be just around the corner. Access technology has made some
 major leaps and bounds over the years but the time may have
 come for us to start pushing harder for a more co-operative
 environment – a landscape where all stakeholders could work
 together to open wide the doors and help build a future where
 full accessibility is a reality, not just something that’s seen as
 nice to have.
</p>
<p> 
 It may not be beyond the realms of possibility to imagine:
</p>
<p> 
 1: The price of access technology being made more affordable
 as more developers engage in open source software
 development. There is already quite a bit of this going on, and
 somehow I feel confident that this trend is only going to
 become more popular as time moves on.
</p>
<p> 
 2: A flood of apps emerging to enable blind and sight-impaired
 people to function more independently with their hand-held
 devices. This trend has already started, and if we could
 convince manufacturers that it is a necessity that can benefit
 people other than the blind and sight-impaired, then who
 knows – the sky’s the limit! More manufacturers could easily
 be convinced to follow in Apple’s footsteps.
</p>
<p> 
 3: More web developers allowing access technology to
 communicate more easily with their content, forms and
 documents. A world where governments, companies and web
 designers and developers would finally see the light and
 embrace opportunities to create a situation where everybody
 wins out.
</p>
<p> 
 4: Access technology hugely expanding career possibilities for
 blind and sight-impaired people, by allowing them to access
 information more independently and quickly and to
 communicate more easily with the sighted world.
</p>
<p> 
 5: Social networks being made much easier to use, if we can all
 work out ways to enable access technology to communicate
 more effectively with social network websites, chatrooms,
 skype and so on.
</p>
<p> 
 So 2011 is going to be a very interesting year. Governments are
 going to hear more from us and companies are going to be told
 that more people will be demanding greater access to their
 products and services. Could 2011 be the start of an era where
 we get to work more closely with the sighted world? Why not?
</p>
<p> 
 If I were able to wave my cane and make it all happen, then
 my dearest wish would be that blind and sight-impaired kids
 would be able to grow up in a world where accessibility would
 be a natural part of their daily lives, and blind and sight-
 impaired older people would be able to enjoy golden years of
 virtual socialising.
</p>
<p> 
 With very best wishes for a wonderful year.
 Donna J. Jodhan.
