<h3 id="i140-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Site Owners Ignore Requests To Fix The Web.</h3>
<p> 
 Some 60% of website owners contacted about accessibility
 problems by the national ‘FixTheWeb’ project either ignore the
 contact or “duck the issue”, according to the project’s director.
 And just 10% take action immediately to fix the problem.
</p>
<p> 
 FixTheWeb ( <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/">http://www.fixtheweb.net/</a>
 ) is a national programme allowing any disabled person encountering
 accessibility  problems online to inform a group of volunteers
 – now morethan 600-strong – who will pursue the issue with
 the website owner on their behalf. Volunteers can be contacted
 using email, Twitter, a web  form or a special browser toolbar,
 allowing anyone to report any web accessibility issue quickly
 and easily. The project is led by the digital inclusion charity
 Citizens Online with funding from Nominet Trust.
</p>
<p> 
 So far about 700 websites have been reported through the
 service, Gail Bradbrook, the project’s manager, told the second
 annual Web Accessibility London Unconference at City
 University last week ( <a href="http://a11yldn.org.uk/">http://a11yldn.org.uk/</a>
 ). However of these, only about 50 have been fixed by their owners.
</p>
<p> 
 In all, 40% of contacts made by volunteers received no
 response at all, said Bradbrook: “Somebody probably chose to
 ignore it, unless we got spam filtered.” In a further 20% of
 cases the volunteers were “fobbed off, with people kind of
 acknowledging issue but ducking it”, she said, or in some cases
 showing they had not previously registered the issue of
 accessibility at all.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 30% of people contacted agree they have an accessibility
 problem and say they can’t deal with it now, but it does matter
 to them and they will try and address it in future, she said. And
 in 10% of cases the problem is fixed right away, with half of
 these needing help to do so.
</p>
<p> 
 However even in cases where no response at all is received, the
 project may be achieving something by raising awareness that
 accessibility problems  exist and that people are noticing them,
 Bradbrook said.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the project’s high points so far came when actor, writer
 and technology lover Stephen Fry posted a message of support
 for the campaign, with the resulting PR boost producing its
 biggest rise in activity to date, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 FixTheWeb is currently focused on the UK but is now looking
 for partners to go global, Bradbrook said. Within Europe, it is
 already in the process of setting up a key partnership with
 eAccess+ (<a href="http://www.eaccessplus.eu/">http://www.eaccessplus.eu/</a>
), a European network of e-accessibility experts.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Canadian Government Access Guidelines ‘Not Fastenough’.
</h3>
<p> 
 A blind woman who is battling the Canadian government in the
 courts over the inaccessibility of its websites has said a new
 initiative to improve the sites does not move fast enough.
</p>
<p> 
 Donna Jodhan, a blind accessibility consultant, sued the
 Canadian government last year over the inaccessibility of its
 websites after she was unable to apply for a government job
 online. In December 2010 a judge ruled in favour of Jodhan
 but the government is appealing against the ruling, claiming that
 the judge exceeded his jurisdiction in finding a “system-wide
 failure” of government through its websites, when it was only
 Jodhan who was proved to be directly affected (see our
 January issue <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=532">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=532</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) has now
 published a new standard on web accessibility for government
 agencies ( <a href="http://bit.ly/pYv4Jo">http://bit.ly/pYv4Jo</a>
 ). Under a phased programme, agencies have until the end of the year to submit a report on
 their current state of accessibility. Inaccessible web sites will
 then have to be made accessible in stages, with home pages
 and pages providing “the most important information and
 services” ordered to comply by the end of February 2012; and
 all remaining pages by 31 July, 2013. All new web pages
 published after 1 October, 2011 must immediately conform,
 although exceptions will be allowed to all deadlines in
 circumstances where “exclusion for a period of time can be
 demonstrably justified.”
</p>
<p> 
 A government-wide compliance report will be released by the
 board at the end of February 2012, with updates published
 annually thereafter. If government bodies do not comply a
 range of sanctions are possible including suspension of public
 sector staff from web duties.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan told E-Access Bulletin she thought the release of the
 new guidelines was linked to her legal action, but that it was an
 inadequate response. “It does not go fast enough; their time
 frame is too long,” she said. “I think that a year would be more
 reasonable.”
</p>
<p> 
 She also questioned the government’s commitment to
 accessibility in appealing the 2010 decision in her case. “If the
 government feels that this is going to address the issues raised
 in my court case, then why is it spending all this money to
 appeal the decision that was handed down on in 2010?” she
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Dates have now been set for the appeal of 15 and 16
 November.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan suffered a minor disappointment in August when two
 of three disability organisations which had sought intervention
 status in her case had their requests turned down by the court.
</p>
<p> 
 These were the national blindness charity CNIB, the Canadian
 Council of Disabilities (CCD) and the Alliance for Equality of
 Blind Canadians (AEBC) of which Jodhan herself was elected
 president in May of this year. In an August ruling, the AEBC
 was the only one granted intervener status, allowing it to speak
 in court about the wider implications of any decision taken.
</p>
<p> 
 Responding to this decision, Jodhan said: “These three
 organisations felt that they had a vital and vested interest in this
 case to represent other concerns on a broader level. We were
 all quite surprised that the other two were not granted similar
 status.” The two unsuccessful applicants would have offered a
 broader perspective to her case, Jodhan said, “but they can still
 help in other ways.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Charities Push For Binding Treaty On Global Bookaccess.
</h3>
<p> 
 UK and European blindness charities are stepping up the
 pressure on politicians ahead of a decisive meeting of the
 World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to consider
 rules allowing accessible versions of copyrighted works to be
 shared across borders, giving people with print disabilities
 wider access to books.
</p>
<p> 
 Negotiations at the WIPO General Assembly later this month,
 followed by a meeting of the organisation’s standing committee
 on copyright and related rights (SCCR) in November, are likely
 to settle a long-standing debate on whether access rights to
 copyright works should be the subject of a binding
 international treaty of merely a voluntary ‘recommendation’.
</p>
<p> 
 EU negotiators have been lobbying against full treaty status
 under strong pressure from rightsholders in some member
 states. However the European Blind Union has now submitted
 a petition to the European Parliament's Petitions Committee to
 be heard on 3 October saying the EU’s position contravenes its
 own charter.
</p>
<p> 
 “By opposing such a treaty, the EU Commission and Member
 States are clearly failing to recognise and respect the right of
 persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to
 ensure their independence, social and occupational integration
 and participation in the life of the community”, the petition
 says. “In doing so the commission is failing to live up to its
 commitments to article 26 of the EU Charter of Fundamental
 Rights on the integration of persons with disabilities.”
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)
 has responded to a UK government consultation on the
 copyright negotiations saying the EU’s position in calling for a
 voluntary code or ‘soft law’ runs counter to the UN
 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which
 “makes explicit disabled people’s right to accessible
 information... and that 'laws protecting IP rights should not
 place unreasonable or discriminatory barriers in the way of
 access to cultural materials’.”
</p>
<p> 
 “No rights holder organisation would accept the idea that
 voluntary codes of good behaviour signed by consumer
 organisations could be so effective in ensuring an acceptable
 level of rights holder protection that they would remove the
 need for binding copyright law. We likewise reject the
 argument that voluntary cooperation and licensing can replace
 a legally binding right of access to works by print disabled
 people.”
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB rejected moves by some EU negotiators to suggest a
 ‘two-step’ approach, with a joint recommendation to be
 followed by returning to discussions on a treaty at a later date
 but with no guarantee any treaty would emerge.
</p>
<p> 
 “RNIB would like to underline that a two-step approach simply
 postpones – possibly for many years- a full and long overdue
 solution to a problem first identified back in the 1980s... it
 would put in place a second class solution for disabled people,
 in contrast with the first class solution –treaties - offered to
 rights holders to protect their interests.”
</p>
<p> 
 The November meeting is also likely to settle the final wording
 of the text of the proposed recommendation or treaty,
 including the relationship between the new copyright exception
 law and contract law, following progress in June towards a
 single draft document involving compromise on both sides (see
 July issue coverage <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=615">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=615</a>
 ).</p>

<h3 id="i140-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Betagov Standard:</h3>
<p>  The forthcoming ‘beta’ or trial version of the new digital platform for UK government services – due
 to launch in January 2012 – is to be one of the first major
 websites to be designed in compliance with the British Standard
 BS8878 Web Accessibility Code of Practice, the project’s
 accessibility consultant Léonie Watson has revealed.
 Accordingly the site’s developers will be documenting all
 accessibility-related decisions taken throughout the lifecycle of
 the beta site, as well as carrying out extensive user testing and
 consulting with various disability organisations, Watson told E-
 Access Bulletin’s sister publication E-Government Bulletin.
 The prototype ‘Alphagov’ developed earlier this year was the
 subject of much controversy over its lack of support for
 accessibility:

<p>  An online survey of how blind, visually impaired and deaf-blind people use computers and assistive
 technology to access information has been launched by the
 American Council of the Blind and Google. The survey –
 which is open to international web users, though the alternative
 telephone version is a US number – aims to discover how
 people discover, choose and adopt assistive technologies; how
 they make decisions about whether to switch or upgrade tools;
 and their support needs, “as a first step to developing effective
 new ways of accessing information in the cloud”:

<p>  A new support for disabled Members of Parliament, members of the House of Lords and Parliamentary
 staff was launched this month by the Speaker of the House of
 Commons John Bercow MP and celebrated former

<p>  Our reader Tas from London who is blind and also hearing impaired writes in to ask: “I am
 wondering if any of readers may be able to help me.
</p>
<p> 
 “I was given a Tieman CombiBraille 98 - 45 cell unit a few
 years ago. It worked for a while but then the software with it
 failed. I had it working with the JAWS 98 screenreader OK, but
 that no longer works. And the JAWS company said, basically
 just go out and buy a new unit and new JAWS, which was no
 help at all. I cannot afford a new refreshable Braille unit...  it is
 way, way beyond my means.
</p>
<p> 
 “So now the Combi has been sitting in a cupboard and I am
 really struggling with my PC and magnifier. I am using
 windows 7 on a laptop now.
</p>
<p> 
 “Does anyone know of a free or nearly free programme that
 would work with the Combi 98? I just cannot afford anything
 new at all. I don't work because of my disability and am getting
 on a bit now too...

<p> 
 “Someone suggested NVDA and I tried that but again it won't
 work with the Combi. If anyone has any suggestions I would
 be really grateful.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Time To Make Our Voices Heardby Alison Smith.
</h3>
<p> 
 Our accessibility campaign and consultancy group Pesky
 People started life as a blog developed in response to Digital
 Britain, the UK government’s strategy for boosting our digital
 economy which did not include people with disabilities in any
 way. We responded by campaigning against this digital
 discrimination and evolved from a blog into a website and now
 a company.
</p>
<p> 
 We are just one example of how disabled and deaf people now
 have the opportunity to be a part of the web - to use it, to come
 up with ideas that work for them and others and to make them
 happen. Go Genie (<a href="http://www.gogenie.org">http://www.gogenie.org</a>
) is our response to the need for easy to find access information that crowdsources
 information from disabled people themselves, but is useful for
 everybody.
</p>
<p> 
 It isn’t so much about ‘helping’ disabled people: we are not just
 passive recipients of the wonderful technologies and assisted
 technologies available - although many organisations and
 companies see us like that and would prefer us to remain like
 that.
</p>
<p> 
 I am horrified that companies developing digital products for
 disabled people seem to only see us in monetary terms and fail
 to develop useful products that are funky and stylish and
 affordable. Why not?
</p>
<p> 
 The cost of some of these products are prohibitive so many
 disabled people can’t buy them (I’m told it is the low number
 of units made that make them expensive – though I’m not
 totally convinced by that).
</p>
<p> 
 Assistive technology can be expensive and out the reach of
 many people's budgets. Is it fair that while a smartphone can
 cost &pound;500, to purchase screenreader software for one computer
 costs around &pound;1,000? Or that eye-tracking technology assisted
 products can cost up to &pound;8,000, while in the high street a
 Kinect box using motion technology can cost &pound;199.99?
</p>
<p> 
 It's no wonder people with severely restricted mobility are
 using head wands and wooden visual alphabetical keyboards.
 Where are the affordable assisted technology products?
</p>
<p> 
 Mainstream companies are ignoring us as a market and failing
 to make their products accessible. Have you ever tried to find a
 mobile that works with your digital hearing aids or visual
 impairment?  It took me six months to find a new mobile that
 met my needs. The information is not out there and companies
 are ignoring us.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK Disability Market is worth around &pound;80 billion a year
 and last year the older market was worth &pound;100 billion or more.
 So what is their excuse? By 2033, 23% of the population will
 be aged 65+ so maybe the economics will drive the innovation
 and companies will rise to the challenge.
</p>
<p> 
 I see our future as being a bigger part of digital technology,
 making our mark and actively engaging with the technologies
 on offer.
</p>
<p> 
 I’m a newcomer to this sector but with 20 years’ experience of
 working in the cultural sector as an artistic programmer and
 project manager particularly in disability arts I’ve discovered
 that if I can work to see our ideas into action then others can
 too. The concepts have potential for disabled people as artists,
 entrepreneurs, and consumers.
</p>
<p> 
 We can turn the old order on its head so that disabled and deaf
 people take the lead and initiative to use the internet and the
 technologies available for our benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 It is empowering that social media connects us up. It gives us a
 voice and the opportunity to say what we need and want and
 come together easily to achieve that.
</p>
<p> 
 The opposite side of the coin is that real life barriers are also
 virtual barriers, unless we challenge them and do something to
 change them ourselves. We need to grab that opportunity.
