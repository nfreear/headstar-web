<h3 id="i143-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New Setback For Global Copyright Exception Treaty.</h3>
<p> 
 Moves to create an international treaty to allow accessible
 versions of copyrighted works to be shared across borders,
 giving people with print disabilities wider access to books,
 received a setback this month following “aggressive”
 intervention by EU negotiators.
</p>
<p> 
 Between 21 November and 2 December, the World Intellectual
 Property Organisation (WIPO) held a meeting in Geneva of its
 standing committee on copyright and related rights that
 negotiators for the World Blind Union (WBU) had hoped
 would clear the way for agreement on a copyright treaty.
</p>
<p> 
 Hopeful signs had emerged from a June session of the
 committee, at which WIPO member states had agreed to merge
 several previously separate positions into a single draft
 document which became known as “the chair’s text” (see E-
 Access Bulletin, July 2011
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=615">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=615</a>
 ). The new meeting, however, cast uncertainty on the plans after
 the chair, Manuel Guerra Zamarro from Mexico, unexpectedly
 invited members to submit further amendments.
</p>
<p> 
 Negotiators  for the EU subsequently attempted to reintroduce
 clauses that would require rights-holders to formally authorise
 and pre-approve organisations to use any exception, a
 condition the WBU says would render the whole exercise close
 to pointless.
</p>
<p> 
 “The EU decided to submit a raft of new and aggressive
 amendments which moved us even further away from an
 agreed text”, WBU Vice Chair Dan Pescod told E-Access
 Bulletin. “They were trying to shoe-horn back in the idea of
 authorisation, but this is a no-no – the whole point of this
 exception is you will use it when you haven’t been given any
 help from rights-holders.”
</p>
<p> 
 The new proposed amendments have now been captured in a
 working document which Pescod says must be fully discussed
 between member states ahead of the next WIPO meeting in
 July 2012. “What we are now urging is for the member states
 to come together before the next meeting to agree the basis for
 a new single text, rather than have a situation where each time
 people throw down amendments, go away and don’t consider
 them until the next meeting,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Another vital issue remains, of whether the new agreement
 becomes a legally binding treaty – as urged by the WBU – or
 softer non-binding guidelines, but Pescod hopes all can be
 resolved in July. “I am still optimistic that we can finish this
 work next year, ahead of a formal diplomatic conference in
 2013.”
</p>
<p> 
 If he is right, new ground will be broken: WIPO normally acts
 to reinforce protection for rights-holders, whereas this treaty
 would reinforce access for users. And it will not have been
 easy: formal negotiations on a treaty began two and a half
 years ago, in May 2009.

<h3 id="i143-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: ‘Fix The Web’ In Struggle For Survival.</h3>
<p> 
 A ground-breaking project to enlist the power of volunteers to
 fix web access problems for disabled people is at risk of
 closure, after failing to secure government funding.
</p>
<p> 
 Fix the Web ( <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/">http://www.fixtheweb.net/</a>
 ) was launched in November 2010 to allow disabled internet users to complain
 quickly and easily about inaccessible websites using Twitter,
 email or online forms. Members of a pool of registered
 volunteers then take responsibility for contacting the website
 owner on the user’s behalf, following up any response and
 feeding back results to the user.
</p>
<p> 
 Since launch, the project has recruited almost 700 volunteers
 who between them have handled more than 1,000 website
 reports and helped to solve problems with several high profile
 sites including the Coventry Building Society, various BBC
 sites and the online scheduling service Doodle. A major rise in
 activity was triggered earlier this year after actor, writer and
 technology lover Stephen Fry posted a message of support for
 the campaign.
</p>
<p> 
 However, despite gaining &pound;50,000 of initial funding from the
 Nominet Trust, and receiving publicity support from
 organisations including RNIB, the project has failed in attempts
 to raise further cash and has now been running for a year
 without any external funding.
</p>
<p> 
 After it emerged that a recent bid for funding from the
 government’s new &pound;10 million Social Action Fund has failed,
 Fix The Web founder Gail Bradbrook, director of programmes
 at Citizens Online, told E-Access Bulletin the project would
 struggle to survive.
</p>
<p> 
 “The government asked for charities to innovate, and that’s
 what Citizens Online has done – we have raised multi-millions
 across all our projects over the years, with not a penny from
 central government. So we’re not a cap-in-hand charity, but
 equally we can’t run on fresh air.
</p>
<p> 
 “Fix The Web still has a huge amount of potential, but it needs
 some design work and some funding to oversee the work by
 volunteers. Come the New Year, if there isn’t a clear plan for
 the project, Citizens Online might have to withdraw because
 our brand will be associated with something that isn’t being
 looked after properly.”
</p>
<p> 
 The project could eventually be sustained by small donations
 from multiple sources, but in the short term needs around
 &pound;150,000 over the next 18 months to help it reach a sustainable
 level, Bradbrook said.
</p>
<p> 
 Citizens Online managed to raise pledges of services worth
 some &pound;270,000 to use as “in kind” match funding for its recent
 Social Action Fund bid. &quot;This shows the level of support and
 commitment to the project. The issue is securing money, when
 so few funders fit to the aims of this project. Times are really
 hard for the voluntary sector, competition is steep,&quot; she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Ironically, the project has attracted interest from organisations
 in other countries including Canada who would like to replicate
 it, Bradbrook said. The intention had always been to expand
 the work internationally, but this vision is now also in
 jeopardy.

<h3 id="i143-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Free Magnifier Among First Smart Accessibility Awards.</h3>
<p> 
 A smartphone app which allows people to magnify text and
 adjust fonts and background colours was among the winners of
 the inaugural Smart Accessibility Awards for smartphone
 applications aimed at supporting disabled and older people
 <a href="http://developer.vodafone.com/smartaccess2011">http://developer.vodafone.com/smartaccess2011</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Zoom Plus Magnifier, developed by a UK partnership of 232
 Studios, Ian Hamilton and Digital Accessibility Centre, offers
 functionality for free that has previously largely only been
 available in software and camera products costing hundreds of
 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 Four international awards of 50,000 Euros each were presented
 by the Vodafone Foundation – a charitable arm of mobile
 communications provider Vodafone –in partnership with AGE
 Platform Europe, a network of organisations working with
 older people, and the campaign group European Disability
 Forum.
</p>
<p> 
 The other winners were Help Talk (
 <a href="http://www.1000empresas.com">http://www.1000empresas.com</a>
 ), an app developed in Portugal allowing people who are unable to speak, such as those
 recovering from strokes, to communicate by tapping on icons;
 Wheelmap (<a href="http://wheelmap.org/en">http://wheelmap.org/en</a>
 ), an app developed in Germany which lets users rate the accessibility for wheelchair
 users of public places; and BIG Launcher (
 <a href="http://biglauncher.com/">http://biglauncher.com/</a>
), an alternative customisable Android home screen for elderly or visually impaired users who often
 struggle to use the small keyboards on most devices, developed
 in the Czech Republic.
</p>
<p> 
 BIG Launcher uses big buttons and large fonts to represent all
 the basic functions of a phone such as voice calls, text
 messages and cameras. Jan Husak, the app’s co-developer,
 says a typical smartphone home screen is not very accessible
 for elderly and blind people, being often crowded with all sorts
 of icons and widgets.
</p>
<p> 
 “On Android, due to its openness, you can choose from
 dozens of launchers, but they mostly offer functions which are
 only appealing to geeks - even more icons, special graphical
 effects and so on.
</p>
<p> 
 “BIG Launcher makes using the phone easy, even for users
 who are scared of new technologies. It allows its users to use
 the phone quickly in any situation, without pulling out their
 glasses or getting lost in the menus.”
</p>
<p> 
 Wheelmap is an app that builds on top of Google maps,
 overlaying information about wheelchair accessibility of any
 location such as a restaurant or railway station sourced from
 users. In its first month 1,200 users registered for the app,
 posting information about 180,000 places.
</p>
<p> 
 Andrew Dunnett, director of the Vodafone Group Foundation,
 told E-Access Bulletin the type of crowdsourcing used by
 Wheelmap held huge promise for disabled people. “The
 potential for that to change people's lives is very impressive.
 The maps are there, the handsets are available - the key is the
 user groups, and how they engage with it.”
</p>
<p> 
 In all some 67 applications were received by the awards, with
 12 shortlisted before the four prizes were award, Dunnett said.
 He confirmed that the foundation would be rerunning the
 awards next year.

<h3 id="i143-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Birthday Standard:</h3>
<p>  A call to make the British standard for developing accessible web sites BS8878 more affordable for
 small businesses is among responses from the user community
 collated on the first birthday of BS8878 by its lead author,
 Jonathan Hassell of Hassell Inclusion. One year after its initial
 publication, the standard has been adopted by organisations
 across central and local government, the NHS, police, retail,
 housing, education and charities, the report says. Although the
 precise number of users is kept confidential by the British
 Standards Institution, organisations known to have adopted it in
 year one include the government services portal Beta.gov;
 Royal Mail Group; and University of Southampton. Many of
 those interviewed felt that the cost of BS8878 was a constraint
 to its uptake, saying the &pound;100 price tag is putting off smaller
 organisations. Support activities planned for 2012 include
 expansion of the BS8878 community of practice on
 meetup.com; and creation of ‘starting point’ templates, case
 studies and tools to help organisations create and share the
 policy documentation needed to follow the standard. Steps are
 also being taken to internationalise the standard:

<h3 id="i143-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Appeal Heard:</h3>
<p>  An appeal by the Canadian government against a 2010 ruling which branded its websites inaccessible to
 disabled citizens, and ordered it to remedy the problem, has
 now been heard. Last year Donna Jodhan, a blind accessibility
 consultant from Canada, successfully sued her government
 after she was unable to apply for a public service job online.
 The government appeal came to court in November. Jodhan
 told E-Access Bulletin the government argued that blind
 Canadians did not have a right to equal access to online
 information, as people could use other channels or gain help
 from sighted staff. The government also claimed the case about
 inaccessible websites had not been proven, referring to
 previous evidence as mere ‘spot checks’. A ruling is now
 expected in the New Year. In September, the Canadian
 government published a new standard on web accessibility for
 its agencies, though Jodhan said at the time this was an
 inadequate response to her case:

<h3 id="i143-06"><b class="Ps">+</b>06: Charter Points:</h3>
<p>  A 10-point ‘Accessible Technology Charter’ aimed at blue-chip corporations and government
 departments has been launched by the Business Taskforce on
 Accessible Technology, a sub-grouping of the Employers'
 Forum on Disability. Pledges contained in the charter include
 that “We will appoint an executive level ICT access champion
 who will report to the board”; “We will routinely consult with
 disabled employees, customers and experts to ensure that we
 understand the impact of our technology on talent
 management, employee productivity and our diverse customer
 base”; “We will allow reasonable personalisation of technology
 by our employees and customers”; and “We will give our
 relevant ICT people the ‘disability know how’ needed to
 deliver effective business processes and reasonable
 adjustments for disabled colleagues and customers”. Launch
 signatories include BT, BUPA, the Department for Work and
 Pensions, Lloyds Banking Group and Sainsbury's:

<h3 id="i143-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Future Web:</h3>
<p>  A European project to investigate the accessibility for disabled and older people of ‘Web 2.0’
 applications including mobile web; user-generated content;
 social networks and web TV has been launched. The 2.7
 million euro “Inclusive Future Internet Web Services” (I2Web)
 project is being led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied
 Information Technology in Germany, with partners including
 the UK’s Foundation for Assistive Technology and the
 University of York. Initial work has investigated the ways that
 disabled and older people currently use web 2.0 services, and
 before the project’s completion in April 2013 it will look to
 create new tools to help developers produce more accessible
 applications:

<p>  There was a big response to last issue’s request from Fay Rohrlach from South Australia for help with
 using the ZoomText magnifier to magnify PDF files without
 distortion; and her related query about how to convert PDF
 files into Word 2003 files.
</p>
<p> 
 Ted Page, director of accessibility consultancy PWS, writes that
 if PDF text is appearing fuzzy when using the magnifier, “the
 problem here lies with ZoomText rather than the document
 author. ZoomText uses a really effective technology called
 xFont to smooth out fonts in web pages, but in the current
 version (ZoomText 9) it doesn’t work in PDFs.”
</p>
<p> 
 However, the next version - ZoomText 10 – is set for imminent
 release, Ted writes, and this might extend xFont to PDF files. “I
 have emailed the makers of ZoomText, ai squared, to see if
 they will let on... I will let you know if I hear anything.”
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile reader Paul Wood writes in to recommend the
 website DocsPal (<a href="http://www.docspal.com">http://www.docspal.com</a>
). “This site can convert pds to word files that can easily be read, though the old
 adage still remains - ‘rubbish in, rubbish out!’
</p>
<p> 
 “There is also the 'Copy as text' feature of Acrobat Reader, if
 desperate. And other paid for applications that will do optical
 character recognition on the pdf, if it’s an image.”
</p>
<p> 
 Martin Slack writes in to add that text in a PDf can be
 magnified from within the free Adobe Acrobat Reader, without
 the use of ZoomText, as long as the file has been created using
 text and not images of text.
</p>
<p> 
 “Under the View &gt; Zoom menu in Acrobat Reader is an item
 called Reflow. It is the last item on its sub-menu, and may also
 be activated by the hotkey Control+4, without going into the
 menu system at all. When Reflow is activated, the normal
 Acrobat Reader magnification hotkey (control+plus) will
 magnify the text in such a way that when the line becomes too
 long for the screen, it will wrap.
</p>
<p> 
 “Naturally this means that you lose the original document
 formatting, but on the other hand you can magnify the text
 until each word is on its own line.”
</p>
<p> 
 Finally Opeolu Akinola, an assistive technology consultant
 from Lagos in Nigeria, writes to answer Fay’s second query, on
 converting PDF filesinto Word.
</p>
<p> 
 “I don't know any direct way of converting PDF directly to
 Word but you can convert it to text by going to the file menu
 and selecting the Save As Text... option. Then open your Word
 and use the Open dialogue to locate and open the file (Word
 opens text files). If this does not work, open the text file in
 Notepad, select all the text and copy and paste into Word.”

Complaint Published Last Month From Martin Jones About The
Inaccessibility Of The Online Auction Service Ebay To Blind
People Using Screenreaders Who Want To List Items For Sale.
</h3>
<p> 
 “The author was firstly asking if anyone had a work-around or
 other way of using the web site... why should we be asking this
 in today's equality environment?
</p>
<p> 
 “It is about time the RNIB, the Equality and Human Rights
 Commission or some other national representative organisation
 took one of these large sites to court under equality law.
</p>
<p> 
 “From the description in the article, the author seems to have a
 prima facia case that he cannot use a service provided by
 eBay, and that no alternative exists. This is not even a case of
 &quot;reasonable adjustment&quot;, this sounds like a case of systemic
 inaccessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 “When is someone going to stand up for us and take one of
 these companies to court? I have heard of no such case in the
 UK and yet your newsletter reports in the same issue of a US
 case against Disney so come on UK organisations, stop being
 nice and &quot;co-operative&quot; with companies; take them to court and

<h3 id="i143-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Crash Course:</h3>
<p>  Meanwhile the same Allan Milne – he has been busy – writes with a complaint of his own about an initial
 flaw in a service also mentioned in our last issue – an online
 course on web accessibility launched by digital inclusion
 charity AbilityNet with the Equality and Human Rights
 Commission and BCS (the Chartered Institute for IT).
</p>
<p> 
 “On 23 November I went to the supplied web address which
 was a simple form with only a few straightforward controls,
 using my Dolphin SuperNova screenreader; the first few boxes
 were fine with &quot;first name&quot; and so on announced for the form
 edit boxes. But then I got down to an edit box with no prompt
 announced, followed by a button simply announced as
 &quot;button&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 “After reading around in virtual focus eventually I found the
 last edit box was for comments. I then made a leap of faith that
 the final button would be for submitting the form so I went
 ahead, entering comments about these accessibility issues and
 pressing the button.
</p>
<p> 
 “Obviously my assumptions were correct since I received an
 email the following day apologising for the lack of labels
 accessible to my screenreader and intimating these had been
 corrected. So that was good customer service – but the email
 also contained a request for me to try these out myself... did
 the web development team not have the facility to test this
 out?”
</p>
<p> 
 Allan did try the site again, this time from his work computer
 using a JAWS screen-reader, only to find that while the
 comment and button were now correctly announced,
 announcements were now missing from the initial edit boxes.
</p>
<p> 
 “After further communication to the authors of this issue the
 form was then reported as being fully labelled. I have not
 verified this.
</p>
<p> 
 “My analysis of this is that this was because SuperNova reads
 any text to the left of an edit box, while JAWS only reads
 correctly attached labels. From this I infer that none of the edit
 boxes on the original form had labels or captions associated
 with them. When the authors were made aware of the comment
 and button issues I can only assume they only amended this
 code without any checking of the other edit boxes.
</p>
<p> 
 “What hope is there for accessibility when a page that is
 promoting a web accessibility course and is authored by the
 professional IT society is inaccessible in the first place and
 incorrectly updated when this is brought to their attention?”

 staffed at the entrance by a “concierge”, feels a long way from
 a traditional cramped high street mobile shop.
</p>
<p> 
 The clear, large lettering of the shop’s signs are a hint that
 something else is different: the store is attempting to integrate
 support for disabled customers including deaf people and blind
 people into its mainstream service. Staff have received
 awareness training from the Royal National Institute of Blind
 People (RNIB) and sign language agency Positive Signs.
</p>
<p> 
 Asad Hamir, one of the store’s directors, is a qualified optician,
 with direct experience of the poor level of service that people
 with impaired vision receive on the high street. He has been
 quoted as saying he would like to create the sort of
 environment to which opticians would feel comfortable
 sending their low vision patients, and this is clearly part of the
 motivation behind the store’s attempts to offer the best advice
 on the benefits that mobile devices can provide for people with
 sensory impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 It’s not just a moral stand: the directors also see inclusion as a
 business opportunity. “If a section of the population is not
 being catered for or looked after, it’s definitely a market”, says
 Andrew Levey, the store’s marketing manager.
</p>
<p> 
 Perhaps the most powerful advocate for the store’s approach is
 a member of its staff, Abigail Gorman. Deaf and fluent in BSL,
 Gorman is one of the shop’s three O2 “gurus” working through
 bookable appointments to offer specialist advice to both
 hearing and deaf customers.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the only people in the world currently working in an
 integrated high street role of this kind, she works with a sign
 language interpreter funded from the government’s Access to
 Work scheme.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin with the help of her interpreter
 in a bright corner of the “workshop”, having just finished
 advising a hearing customer, Gorman said her work
 background did not have anything to do with mobiles.  But
 thanks to text messaging and internet access they are an
 indispensible part of modern life for deaf people as for
 everyone else, and she had first-hand experience of the
 barriers that can be thrown up on the high street when she went
 with her mother – who is also deaf – visited one shop with a
 sign language interpreter.
</p>
<p> 
 “When we arrived, they said have you called customer
 services? If not, then we can’t help”, Gorman says. “What can
 you do? Deaf people can’t call customer services.”
</p>
<p> 
 So when she saw the job advertised she jumped at the chance,
 and with the selection process supported for O2 by Positive
 Signs, successfully won through a large number of candidates
 to become O2’s first deaf guru.
</p>
<p> 
 If a deaf person comes into the store or books an appointment
 with her, she says she tries to show there are ways to solve the
 inevitable problems and issues that they face in communicating
 using mainstream devices.
</p>
<p> 
 “It’s about problem sharing, making it normalised.”
</p>
<p> 
 The main ways deaf people use mobiles is for text messaging
 and video calls, and with more and more phones carrying a
 front-facing camera and the rise of apps allowing free
 international communication over the web, there are a wide
 range of solutions, Gorman says.
</p>
<p> 
 For Apple users, one of the most important features for deaf
 people is the video utility FaceTime; BlackBerry offers the
 BBM instant messaging app; and other multi-platform video,
 voice and chat clients include Skype, Tango and ooVoo.
</p>
<p> 
 One issue for deaf users is that tariffs are based around voice
 calls, which they cannot use, she says: “At the moment, you
 have to pay for inclusive minutes. So though deaf people only
 benefit from internet and texts, we pay for calls as well.” The
 tariff she tends to recommend is 100 mins, 500 free texts and
 internet access, though a deaf person would use an internet app
 for text in any case.
</p>
<p> 
 Another minor irritation for a deaf user is voicemail, Gorman
 says. “A message comes up and says you have voicemail – but
 you have to call it to delete them. I have 52, because I never
 get round get round to asking someone to delete them for me!”
</p>
<p> 
 Gorman is the first deaf guru, but she says she hopes the
 concept will take off at other shops to allow proper research
 and trials to be run into how disabled customers can be served
 even better.
</p>
<p> 
 Since the store’s opening, use by disabled people has started
 slowly but a marketing campaign involving word of mouth,
 press campaigns, promotion through charities and disability
 networks such as deaf clubs around London is underway to
 spread the word and try to prove the concept makes good
 business sense.
</p>
<p> 
 Plans are in hand to expand advice and services for people
 with motor and learning difficulties, and the RNIB plans to
 hold events at the workshop looking at the accessibility of
 mobiles. The disability community will be hoping that this is
 the future of high street retail.
