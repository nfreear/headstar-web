<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: ‘Fix The Web’ Project Makes Early Impact.</h3>
<p> 
 A three-month-old project using ‘crowdsourcing’ to improve
 the accessibility of websites for disabled people has already
 helped to solve problems with 26 sites, including those of the
 BBC and a large UK building society, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The Fix the Web project ( <a href="http://www.fixtheweb.net/">http://www.fixtheweb.net/</a>
 ), which launched in November and was previewed in our September
 issue ( <a href="http://bit.ly/eQDmpC">http://bit.ly/eQDmpC</a>
 ), recruits volunteers to contact website owners on behalf of disabled internet users who
 encounter access problems.
</p>
<p> 
 Users contact Fix the Web with complaints through the Fix the
 Web site, email, Twitter or a new toolbar, developed by the
 University of Southampton ( <a href="http://bit.ly/exuzAc">http://bit.ly/exuzAc</a>
 ), and the volunteers then take up the complaints on their behalf,
 allowing people to report any problems in one simple step.
</p>
<p> 
 Coventry Building Society (CBS) was one company contacted
 by Fix the Web after a disabled computer user experienced
 problems logging into its online banking services using an
 assistive technology head-operated mouse. The issue was
 found to be related to a function of the Trusteer Rapport
 security software recommended by CBS. Both CBS and
 Trusteer worked with Fix the Web, and have agreed to update
 their user instructions.
</p>
<p> 
 Other companies that have resolved website issues flagged up
 by Fix the Web include several BBC sites, with work on
 tagging of images and resizing of text, and Doodle (an online
 scheduling service), which is currently working on making its
 site more accessible to screen-readers.
</p>
<p> 
 “Website owners have responded well and have been keen to
 resolve issues and work with us”, Fix the Web spokesperson
 Nicky Ferry told E-Access Bulletin. “We’re not taking a name-
 and-shame approach or trying to make people look bad. Our
 work is much more collaborative”, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Future plans for Fix the Web include looking at creating a ‘two-
 tier’ system of volunteers (as some posses technical web
 knowledge and can assist in fixing the flagged problems), and
 also to take the project to an international level in the long-
 term: “Once we feel that the system is robust enough, we will
 look at taking it into a European context and then globally. For
 it to be of real effect, it should be a global project”, said Ferry.
</p>
<p> 
 The project has also received celebrity endorsement, with the
 actor, comedian and technology fan Stephen Fry publicly
 backing the campaign this month.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Canadian Coalition Pushes For Broadcast AccessRevolution.
</h3>
<p> 
 A coalition of Canadian disability organisations is set to hear if
 it has been successful in obtaining funding to create one of the
 world’s leading bodies promoting access to broadcasting
 services.
</p>
<p> 
 The Access 2020 Coalition ( <a href="http://www.mediac.ca/proj-">http://www.mediac.ca/proj-</a>
 Access2020.asp ), led by the non-profit body Media Access
 Canada, has asked the Canadian Radio-television and
 Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to support the
 proposal as part of the conditions the commission is set to
 attach to its approval of a TV network takeover.
</p>
<p> 
 BCE (<a href="http://www.bce.ca/">http://www.bce.ca/</a>
 ), owner of communications company Bell, announced in September last year it is to
 acquire Canada’s largest TV network, CTV. Any change in
 control of a Canadian broadcaster must include a package of
 benefits to the industry, and Access 2020 has asked the
 commission to require BCE to allocate 1% of the value of its
 purchase of CTV – around 13 Million Canadian dollars – to a
 trust fund that would ensure 100% accessibility for all
 Canadians across all digital platforms by the year 2020. The
 proposed initiative, A Bridge to the Future (see
 <a href="http://www.mediac.ca">http://www.mediac.ca</a>
 ), includes elements of technology, research and education.
</p>
<p> 
 In response, BCE has offered to allocate a lesser sum – 5.7
 million dollars – to set up a ‘Bell Broadcasting Accessibility
 Fund’ with similar objectives, and in consultation with the
 disability community. However, Media Access Canada
 Executive Director Beverley Milligan told E-Access Bulletin
 this week that BCE’s counter-proposal was unacceptable, as it
 would not be fully independent or transparent. Disability
 organisations would continue to press for funding for a fully
 independent accessibility body, and were confident of winning
 the day, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 “We are convinced that this issue is critical to the success of
 the plan. Our goal of being empowered, will not be achieved if
 [we must] wait to be consulted by broadcasters and
 telecommunications companies, without resources of our own
 to initiate required research, but with our names appended to
 documents authored by broadcasters, telecommunications or
 their agents, and over which we have had little, if any,
 meaningful input.
</p>
<p> 
 “It is only through allowing accessibility organisations and
 experts to take the lead in decision, research and technological
 innovation that the real systemic barriers can be properly
 addressed. The broadcasters will never act on what they see
 only as a no-return expense line item.
</p>
<p> 
 “A ruling in our favour would mean we could get to work and
 get the job done.”
</p>
<p> 
 The CRTC is expected to render its decision around 25 March.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Disability Severely Limits Net Access, Us Survey Finds.</h3>
<p> 
 Two per cent of US adults – six million people – have a
 disability that makes it difficult or impossible for them to use
 the internet, according to new research on the technology
 habits and abilities of disabled US citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey by the Pew Research Center ( <a href="http://bit.ly/i0hWaq">http://bit.ly/i0hWaq</a>
 ), a non-partisan body conducting social science research, also
 found that Americans with a disability are less likely than other
 adults to use the internet, with just 54% of US adults with a
 disability (around 45 million people) reporting themselves as
 going online, compared with 81% of non-disabled adults.
</p>
<p> 
 The quality of internet speed and access were also shown to
 vary according to a person’s disability profile. “People living
 with disability, once they are online, are also less likely than
 other internet users to have high-speed access or wireless
 access. For example, 41% of adults living with a disability
 have broadband at home, compared with 69% of those without
 a disability”, the survey found.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey ( <a href="http://bit.ly/hv0Hrh">http://bit.ly/hv0Hrh</a>
 ) said all these factors could impact negatively on an individual’s employment and life
 opportunities.
</p>
<p> 
 The research for ‘Americans living with disability and their
 technology profile’ was conducted using telephone interviews
 with more than 3,000 people from the US, between August and
 September 2010.

<p>  Last issue, David Bates wrote in to ask advice on free or open source software to convert Word files
 to audio formats.
</p>
<p> 
 In the first of three responses, Daniele Marano of
 Hilfsgemeinschaft, a support organisation for the visually
 impaired in Austria, wrote: “The best open source [tool] to
 convert audio into mp3 or DAISY is RoboBraille (
 <a href="http://www.robobraille.org">http://www.robobraille.org</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 “The service supports many languages and the text to speech
 engine used is from Loquendo so that even an open source has
 high quality. The service is free for non-commercial purposes.”
</p>
<p> 
 Daniele acts as the local co-ordinator for RoboBraille in
 Austria.
</p>
<p> 
 Tavis Reddick, an ICT developer at Adam Smith College in
 Fife, Scotland, writes in to recommend another tool, called
 ‘Create&amp;Convert’:
 <a href="http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/eduapps/createconvert.php">http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/eduapps/createconvert.php</a>
 “I believe that would do the job,” he says. “I tried an earlier
 version, and it worked quite well.”
</p>
<p> 
 Tavis says that Create&amp;Convert is one of many free, often
 open source educational tools known as ‘EduApps’ provided
 by his local regional support centre for JISC, the higher
 education IT agency:
 <a href="http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/eduapps/">http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.ac.uk/eduapps/</a>
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, Adrian Isbrecht writes in to recommend the quick,
 flexible ‘DSpeech’ tool created by the Italian-based

 “a really good spoken version of any text copied in... any size
 document can be converted easily.”

<h3 id="i134-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Future Imperfect:</h3>
<p>  In our last issue the Canadian accessibility consultant Donna Jodhan set out her vision for a
 more accessible future, expressing the hope that progress
 would soon be made in many areas including more affordable
 software through open source development.
</p>
<p> 
 However Brian Gaff, of Kingston upon Thames Talking
 Newspaper, writes in to say that, at least as far as the UK is
 concerned, “I suspect Donna may well be jumping the gun a
 little.
</p>
<p> 
 “Far from there being a feeling of optimism here, most
 companies and the government are back on access, indeed
 actually cutting services for disabled people, cutting their
 benefits and cutting investment in jobs and access technology
 generally, as the second wave of the recession starts to bite.
</p>
<p> 
 “It seems that disabled people are only worth supporting in
 times of plenty. Are we really such a shallow race that this is
 the way people feel? I suspect if asked, the answer is no. The
 problem is that accountants are paid be for saving money and
 increasing profit at any ‘cost’ to the culture and society in
 general.
</p>
<p> 
 “It’s notable that both the people at screenreader.net and nvda-
 project.org [both creators of free or open source screen-reader
 software] are talking about scaling back their development later
 this year due to a shortage of money pledged by either
 government in the first case or by the industry in the second.
</p>
<p> 
 “So unless something special happens, the fledgling open
 source and free screen-reader could be killed off before it’s
 reached its full potential due to over-zealous, short-term-vision
 bean-counters.”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Conference report- Vision for Equality.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Mind The GapBy Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 The spectre of public spending cuts hovered darkly over last
 month’s Vision for Equality Conference in London, organised
 by the charity Guide Dogs ( <a href="http://www.guidedogs.org.uk">http://www.guidedogs.org.uk</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 With much discussion on access to transport, delegates heard
 that many positive changes have already taken place, such as
 personal assistants being made available for visually impaired
 people on London Underground Tube trains.
</p>
<p> 
 But Fazilet Hadi, Group Director for Inclusive Society at the
 Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), warned that
 ongoing government reforms and budget cuts “hold lots of
 threats” in this area. Specifically, the 28% budget cuts to UK
 local authorities would undoubtedly mean cuts to the
 accessibility of transport services, as well as to the accessibility
 of numerous other services such as social care and libraries,
 Hadi said.
</p>
<p> 
 Independent transport consultant Anne Frye OBE said there
 were three key elements needed for truly accessible transport:
 independence; control; and choice. Pushing for all these
 elements to be put in place is the UK Vision Strategy (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/fCdSS4">http://bit.ly/fCdSS4</a>
 ), a wide-ranging document developed by the VISION 2020 UK umbrella group for vision-impairment
 organisations and the RNIB. In the field of transport, the
 strategy calls for transport providers to make their services
 fully accessible and for the external environment to be made as
 easy as possible to move around in, which includes clear
 pavements, safe crossings and bold signage.
</p>
<p> 
 There is already a legal requirement to provide accessible
 transport in the Equalities Act 2010, which sets out clear
 technical standards both for transport vehicles and pedestrian
 environments, said Frye.
</p>
<p> 
 However, “It is one thing to pass an act of Parliament, but
 another to make sure it happens in trains and buses across the
 country”, she said. As an example, audible announcement
 technology on trains, which can assist both disabled and non-
 disabled passengers, is already “required very clearly by law in
 the Disability Discrimination Act, but more often than not is
 switched off. If you speak to staff, they often don’t know why
 the audible announcement facility is there, or have switched it
 off because they think passengers find it irritating”, said Frye.
</p>
<p> 
 Even though it may remain frustratingly unused, this audible
 announcement technology is at least a legal requirement on
 trains, said Frye. The same is not yet true for buses, although
 there are positive developments in this area, at least in the
 capital, in the form of Transport for London’s ‘iBus’ project –
 a radio and visual display and announcement system fitted on
 every London bus which can assist visually or hearing
 impaired passengers with journey information.
</p>
<p> 
 This system has “transformed the ability to travel around
 London for many people, including those with visual
 impairments,” said Frye. However, Transport for London’s
 primary motive for investing in the system was to replace out-
 of-date equipment, rather than to promote disability rights.
 “They couldn’t have made a business case on that alone, and I
 think that will increasingly be the case where budgets are cut”,
 she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Looking outside the UK, one of the simplest and most
 effective examples of accessible transport technology can be
 found in Barcelona’s Metro system, said Frye, where the
 transport authorities invited blind people to design ticket
 machines for the stations. “The result has been startling,” she
 said. “There used to be staff employed just to stand next to
 machines and explain to travellers where to put your credit
 card and where the ticket came out. They don’t need to do that
 anymore because suddenly the machines are intuitive; so
 there’s a clear economic benefit that comes from applying
 universal design.”
</p>
<p> 
 Another innovative example of how technology can create a
 more accessible transport system was described by Sandra
 Gollan, manager of the Dundee Blind and Partially Sighted
 Society. In Dundee, said Gollan, audio bus departure messages
 are available at city centre bus stops, accessed by council-
 issued travel ‘smart cards’. These cards contain specially fitted
 microchips, enabling visually impaired passengers to swipe the
 card and receive the live audible messages.
</p>
<p> 
 This kind of real-time information could also be used on
 board the vehicles, Gollan said. A chipped card could allow
 passengers in the seats put aside for disabled travellers to
 access audible information during journeys, without it being
 disruptive for other passengers, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 “The technology is out there, but we aren’t pushing it enough”
 Gollan said. “It’s the same with consultations; a lot of visually
 impaired people listen to [blind-specific] radio, so why not
 allow them to hear the debate over the radio and phone-in, so
 they don’t have to physically get to a destination and can just
 pick up their telephone to explain what their problems are?
 There’s a lot of technology out there that we could be using.”
