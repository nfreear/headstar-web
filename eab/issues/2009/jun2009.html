<h3 id="i114-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Ofcom Report Uncovers Major Accessibility Research Gap.</h3>
<p> 
 Communications, technology and broadcasting companies are
 currently carrying out &quot;very little research&quot; into the accessibility
 requirements of consumers and the needs of disabled people, a new
 report has found.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, based on interviews with 20 companies, was prepared by i2
 media research for the Advisory Committee on Older and Disabled
 People (ACOD), a sub-group of the communications industry regulator
 Ofcom.
</p>
<p> 
 The report (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/of1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/of1</a>
 ) found companies are carrying out very limited user research into
 usability and accessibility, and even less into the specific needs of
 those people that required accessible products. Of the research that was
 conducted, most of it was &quot;small-scale&quot;, based around company
 workers, or family and friends, due to ease of access.
</p>
<p> 
 Reasons for the failure included higher priority being afforded to other
 technical issues, the report found: &quot;One reason repeatedly given for the
 lack of user research was that technical issues took higher priority, to
 get products and services working. Usability and accessibility were
 referred to as secondary priorities.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Other findings of the report included that senior level support of
 accessibility issues was often important to addressing disabled
 consumers' needs, and that some companies had not considered
 accessibility needs at all, as they did not see disabled users as included
 in their target audience.
</p>

<h3 id="i114-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Interactive Media Association Chair To Prioritise Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility is to become a key priority for the British Interactive
 Media Association (BIMA -
 <a href="http://www.bima.co.uk/">http://www.bima.co.uk/</a>
), the body representing the interactive and digital content sector,
 incoming chair Justin Cooke has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Cooke is managing director of web design agency Fortune Cookie,
 which has a track record of creating accessible websites for clients
 such as Legal and General. He has been elected chair of BIMA for
 three years, heading an executive board that also includes senior
 representatives of leading ad agencies, national newspaper websites,
 digital agencies and recruitment and skills firms.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;In order for something to be interactive - to allow people to engage,
 interact and transact - it has to be accessible,&quot; Cooke told the bulletin
 in an exclusive interview the week after his appointment.
 &quot;Accessibility needs to be a key principle in developing interactive
 work. It is about removing barriers - by removing barriers for
 everybody, accessibility in a purer sense can be taken care of.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Cooke said he will recommend that BIMA create a set of simple, clear
 guidelines on accessibility for its members as part of a 100-day plan to
 create measurable proposals for improvement. &quot;We will not create our
 own standards, but I want to showcase how you create accessible
 experiences and promote best practice.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 He said he will also look at introducing accessibility as a key part of
 the education work BiMA carries out with schools, colleges and
 universities, aimed at boosting skills and bringing talented recruits into
 the industry.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the key point for the interactive media industry is that
 accessible products will be a bigger commercial success, Cooke said.
 &quot;Accessibility isn't just about compliance, it's about return on
 investment,&quot; he said. &quot;If a product is more accessible, you are going to
 make more money. But there is still some education to be done in this
 area.&quot;

<h3 id="i114-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Public Procurement Enlisted To Improve Equality.</h3>
<p> 
 Public sector procurement should be used to improve equality for
 people with disabilities, including the development of more accessible
 IT systems, according to a government bill passing through Parliament.
</p>
<p> 
 The Equality Bill
 ( <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/equality.html">http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/equality.html</a>

 ), introduced to the Commons on 24 April and currently undergoing its
 committee stages, aims to reform and harmonise equality law. Notes
 accompanying the bill say: &quot;With an annual expenditure of around
 &pound;175 billion every year on goods and services, the public sector has an
 important opportunity to use its purchasing power to promote equality
 where possible.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Aimed at replacing previous legislation on inequality, including the
 Disability Discrimination Act, the bill calls for selective procurement
 to ensure public services reflect the skills and needs of a diverse
 society. &quot;It is right that public money is spent on goods and services in
 a way that advances the government's public policy objectives on
 equality,&quot; the notes say.
</p>
<p> 
 Examples of how this strategy could be implemented are outlined,
 including the use of pre-qualification questionnaires for assessing the
 suitability of potential suppliers, with a possible requirement to
 disclose any previous breaches of equality legislation.
</p>
<p> 
 The Employers' Forum on Disability has welcomed the bill. Speaking
 to E-Access Bulletin about procurement of accessible ICT equipment,
 Vanessa Hardy, EFD's Campaigns Manager, said: &quot;We know that
 many disabled employees are still faced with inaccessible non-web
 based legacy in the workplace. However, [suppliers] are starting to
 understand the mutual benefits to business and disabled people of
 delivering accessible and usable products.&quot;

<p>  It is always a delight to receive letters from our readers across the globe, and this month we have two. Asim Rauf from
 Pakistan writes in to contribute to our ongoing debate about the right of
 blind people to have audio access to electronic books, in the wake of
 news stories describing the removal of a speech function from some
 electronic book readers in a dispute over audio licensing.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I am reading the discussion regarding disabling text-to-speech of e-
 books,&quot; writes Asim. &quot;If it is a right to buy and read books, similarly, it
 is also a right to have access to books purchased by blind people. If a
 person buys a book, and he is unable to read the same, then his right is
 violated.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I am therefore of the view, that the text-to-speech characteristic at the
 web should not be disabled. Otherwise, it will amount to depriving
 visually impaired people of their right to read books. Second, can
 anyone help me in finding free e-book sites, from where I can read
 good books?&quot;

Section Three: Ofcom report
- Acces barriers.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Communication Breakdown?By Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 &quot;The more this gets talked about, the better&quot;, says one interviewee in a
 new report on access to communications, broadcasting and IT by older
 people and people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 It sounds simple enough, but it's a key point: tackling barriers to
 accessibility is not an insurmountable task, but the starting points are
 realising the issues, airing them, and discussing them: all sadly still
 quite rare in modern organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, 'Exploring how manufacturers, suppliers and retailers
 address the needs of older and disabled people: what are the barriers
 and drivers?' (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/of1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/of1</a>
 ), was undertaken by i2 media research for the Advisory Committee on
 Older and Disabled People (ACOD -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/acod1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/acod1</a>
 ), a sub-group of communications and broadcasting industry regulator
 Ofcom. Its findings were based on interviews with senior figures from
 20 companies, representing a cross-section of the broadcasting,
 telecommunications and online sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 The interviewee responses pinpoint a number of barriers preventing
 their respective industries from better addressing the needs of disabled
 people. Lack of user research into usability and accessibility was found
 to be a common barrier, and this was also found to be true even in
 larger companies that carry out substantial consumer research on other
 topics.
</p>
<p> 
 There was found to be a reliance in some organisations on &quot;gut feeling
 and expertise&quot; to address customer needs, rather than specialist
 research. Tellingly, one interviewee said: &quot;If we always did what the
 customer wants, we wouldn't move forward at all.&quot; This apparent
 knowledge gap might help explain why some participants also reported
 that they found it difficult to build a business case for more accessible
 products.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as uncovering obstacles to progress, a key objective of the
 report was to identify what could be done to improve the current
 situation and overcome obstructive barriers. Several common themes
 emerged in this respect, including - unsurprisingly, given the 'gut
 feeling' finding - calls for greater availability of current research on
 the needs of disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Other ideas for improvement included using the procurement process
 to demand more accessible products, and better consumer
 communications. In fact, several interviewees said consumers currently
 &quot;do not have sufficiently high expectations of the usability and
 accessibility of media products and services.&quot; This is a problem, since
 if customer feedback about accessibility and usability is not present, it
 will be even harder for companies to encourage developments in this
 area, the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 The report's primary conclusion was that despite finding evidence of
 support of accessibility issues in some companies, other pressures
 often took priority. These often included commercial considerations:
 &quot;If companies do not believe they will benefit financially from
 addressing the needs of older and disabled people . and if there is no
 external requirement or incentive for them to do so . there is little
 reason to envisage a change to the status quo.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The report warns of a potentially bleak future for accessibility should
 this external encouragement not be supplied: &quot;The current economic
 downturn and competing commercial pressures are likely to limit the
 extent to which industry is able to better address the needs of older and
 disabled people.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 It was also concluded that a more collaborative approach across the
 industry was needed, as well as better co-operation between the
 industry and stakeholders. Many companies were happy to address
 accessibility and usability issues, but wanted to do so through an
 inclusive method - potentially through communication with charities
 and government - rather than being &quot;lobbied or pressurised&quot; into doing
 so.
</p>
<p> 
 On the positive side, the report does suggest that most companies are
 willing to explore accessibility issues, providing that certain criteria are
 met, and that they are certain the need exists in the first place. Which
 brings us neatly back to our opening remark: the more accessibility is
 openly discussed, and the need for action is firmly established, the
 better for all concerned.
