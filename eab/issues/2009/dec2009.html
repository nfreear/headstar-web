<h3 id="i120-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Call For Compliance With Un Convention Covering Ict Rights.</h3>
<p> 
 Disability rights groups, organisations working with people with
 disabilities and all other interested parties must carefully monitor their
 home nations' compliance with the UN Convention on Rights of
 Persons with Disabilities to ensure moves towards more accessible
 information and communications technologies (ICT) do not fall by the
 wayside, one of the world's leading accessibility analysts writes in this
 month's E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Cynthia Waddell, Executive Director of The International Center for
 Disability Resources on the Internet (ICDRI - <a href="http://www.icdri.org/">http://www.icdri.org/</a>
 ), says the Convention entered into legal force in May 2008 and starting
 next year, 2010, all states that have ratified it will be required to report
 to the UN Committee on Rights of Persons with Disabilities on
 measures taken to meet its accessible ICT obligations.
</p>
<p> 
 The Convention has helped to create a paradigm shift in the exercise of
 the rights of people with disabilities in the use of ICT, Waddell says,
 with many provisions relating to ICT availability, affordability and
 accessibility through principles of 'universal design'. &quot;But it is one
 thing to have a law or policy, and another to implement it.if the UN
 Convention is to succeed, then its monitoring provisions need to be
 followed. The Convention requires the signatory states to designate
 focal points within each country to assist in implementation and
 monitoring. I encourage you to find out who the designated focal
 points are in your country and to contribute your voice to the
 Convention implementation effort and the country Monitoring Report.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The ongoing controversy over the Kindle 2 - an electronic book reader
 with a text-to-speech feature which has been embroiled in a row over
 royalties from what some see as a new 'audio book' format - &quot;reminds
 us that the accessible ICT paradigm shift is fragile and can be broken,&quot;
 Waddell says.

<h3 id="i120-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Uk'S First Educational E-Book Library Launched Online.</h3>
<p> 
 The UK's first online library of educational textbooks in a range of
 digital formats accessible to visually impaired students has been
 launched.
</p>
<p> 
 'Books for All' is a joint project between The Seeing Ear (
 <a href="http://www.seeingear.org/">http://www.seeingear.org/</a>
 ), a website which provides electronic books for visually disabled people, and the University of Edinburgh. It allows
 authorised and registered teachers and students with visual
 impairments to access an online catalogue of alternative format
 educational books for free.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessible books are uploaded to the database by teachers, and can
 then be freely downloaded by other schools or registered users in
 formats such as plain text, Word and PDF. Tony Dart, chief executive
 of The Seeing Ear, said the system should eliminate the problem of
 people across the UK having to convert the same book into a format
 accessible for visually impaired students many times. &quot;If a book is a set
 text, it's very often converted locally, with varying degrees of quality.
 This way, we can have one person upload an e-book to make it
 available for everybody.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Dart said that if successful, the project would have a &quot;vast and positive
 impact&quot; on accessible e-learning.
</p>
<p> 
 There are currently around 100 educational titles available through the
 service, and Dart says he hopes this number will increase as more
 schools join. Around 250 schools are already registered.
</p>
<p> 
 Future plans to improve the service include a collaborative editing
 system to correct any mistakes to uploaded texts, and an online
 converter to automatically switch between accessible formats as
 required.

<h3 id="i120-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Automatic Captions Added To Youtube Videos.</h3>
<p> 
 Google, the owner of video exchange website YouTube, has started
 providing automatic captions for some English language videos on the
 website, increasing accessibility for deaf users.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'auto-caps' system is made possible by Google's own automatic
 speech recognition (ASR) technology, working alongside the current
 YouTube captioning system.
</p>
<p> 
 Although captions are already available on YouTube, it was previously
 necessary for the owner of the video to insert them manually - a time-
 consuming task, given the sheer number of videos uploaded to the site.
</p>
<p> 
 Ken Harrenstien, a Google software engineer who is also deaf, said
 recently on the official Google Blog: &quot;Every minute, 20 hours of video
 are uploaded. How can we expect every video owner to spend the time
 and effort necessary to add captions to their videos? Even with all of
 the captioning support already available on YouTube, the majority of
 user-generated video content online is still inaccessible to people like
 me.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Google's ASR technology is also being used to make the manual
 captioning system on YouTube easier and more efficient to use. 'Auto-
 timing' will allow users to caption a video without any specialist
 technical knowledge through creation of a simple text file with a
 transcript of the video's speech. The ASR then converts this text to
 captions by searching for the words at the relevant point in the video.
</p>
<p> 
 The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID:
 <a href="http://www.rnid.org.uk/">http://www.rnid.org.uk/</a>
 ) have supported Google's decision, saying that all on-demand content should be accessible. RNID director of
 external affairs, Emma Harrison, told E-Access Bulletin: &quot;RNID
 welcomes Google taking this first step towards making YouTube more
 accessible for deaf viewers.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Auto-caps are currently live on a series of educational YouTube
 channels (including National Geographic and some American
 universities), in order for Google to gather feedback before rolling out
 the system on a broader basis. The auto-timing feature is currently
 available on all English-language YouTube videos.

<p>  Our article last issue on the UK's first accessible web radio, 'Sonata', from the charity British Wireless for the Blind
 Fund (BWBF) , stated the radios were available on free loan to
 registered blind users.
</p>
<p> 
 However one reader, Delilah, commented on our blog: &quot;I read this
 article with great interest, but cannot find anything on the entire
 [BWBF website] <a href="http://www.blind.org.uk">http://www.blind.org.uk</a>
 [saying] that these devices are on loan free to blind people. It states that if you are registered blind
 or visually impaired you do not have to pay VAT. Otherwise the cost is
 Â&pound;343.85 plus further annual charges of Â&pound;25 each November.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 She continues: &quot;Their website does not work in my preferred browser
 either. The accessibility pages only give instructions for IE and firefox,
 neither of which I like. This is disappointing from a blind charity.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 We contacted the charity, and a spokesperson responded to these points
 as follows: &quot;Unfortunately the website hasn't been updated to reflect
 the fact that it is now available on free permanent loan, but it definitely
 is and if your reader is in receipt of a means-tested benefit and doesn't
 have a set from us already then she might be eligible for one. I will
 chase on getting the website up to date.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;As for the technical comments, this is disappointing to hear and a
 group is looking at the website at the moment so I will pass this on and
 hopefully it's an issue that will be addressed sooner rather than later.&quot;

<h3 id="i120-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Microsoft Suspense:</h3>
<p>  In our October issue we published a query from a reader, who wishes to remain anonymous, about barriers to
 downloading accessible electronic books thrown up by international
 copyright laws. He wrote that none of the blindness-specific accessible
 electronic book players he had found supports the protected Windows
 media format, DRM (Digital Rights Management), due to the costs in
 licensing.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Is there a way to play protected file types on non-standard players,
 and if not, what can we do to convince Microsoft or the producers of
 such players to play these formats?&quot; he asked.
</p>
<p> 
 This month we have received an update from the reader, who has
 forwarded to us a long sequence of emails (more than a dozen in all)
 which followed his own attempts to ask Microsoft directly for answers
 to his questions.
</p>
<p> 
 The emails are all holding replies from Microsoft representatives and
 executives in several countries, carrying such statements as: &quot;It appears
 that we are looking for an answer for you. I will contact you when I
 receive some information&quot;; and &quot;I am hoping that one of you may be
 able to help this gentleman&quot; [an internal email copied to several
 people].
</p>
<p> 
 As E-Access Bulletin went to press however, the signs were more
 hopeful, with a senior executive saying: &quot; Several people [are] looking
 at the situation and working on a response to you. I have pinged them
 this morning to check on the status of their work. As soon as I hear
 back from them, I will let you know when you can expect an answer.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The reader promises to keep us updated.
</p>
<h3 id="i120-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Oneformat Update:</h3>
<p>  In our January 2009 issue, Diana Monahan of Moor End Technology College, Huddersfield, wrote in to describe a
 problem she met in using the 'Oneformat.com' website, which offers
 free accessible web browser style sheets. Diana had said she was &quot;told
 by the school software that 'Virus/spyware Troj/Comic-Fam has been
 detected.'&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The site's creator, Daljit Singh responded to reassure readers that his
 site was safe, and this problem was a software glitch: &quot;Try turning off
 the web shield on the anti-virus program while using Oneformat.com.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Now Diana writes in with her further response: &quot;Thank you for chasing
 this up. My school is trying to contact Sophus who make the antivirus
 to see what can be done as it still says it has detected Troj/Comic-Fam
 so [the] school cannot give me access. The local authority use another
 anti-virus set-up which was also blocking the site but they checked up
 and have now allowed me access to the computer I use at my other
 base.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Technology Changes, Civil Rights Do Notby Cynthia Waddell
</h3>
<p> 
 The UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities addresses
 the rights of 650 million persons with disabilities and impacts two
 billion persons worldwide, including family members of persons with
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Six years in the making, the treaty opened for signatures in March
 2007, receiving the highest number of signatories for any UN treaty on
 its opening day; and entered into legal force in May 2008.
</p>
<p> 
 Starting next year, 2010, all states parties that have ratified the
 Convention (including the US, pending Senate ratification) will be
 submitting a comprehensive report to the Convention's monitoring
 committee, the Committee on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, on
 measures taken to meet the accessible ICT obligations of the
 Convention.
</p>
<p> 
 Some people have expressed surprise that even with the passage of the
 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, there are still gaps in
 the US effort on accessibility. In fact, a gap analysis performed by an
 independent federal agency, the National Council on Disability, found
 there will be several changes needed to conform US laws and policies
 to the obligations of the Convention.
</p>
<p> 
 Worldwide, two paradigm shifts brought on by the Convention are
 having an impact.
</p>
<p> 
 The first is in our basic definition of disability, and how society views
 persons with disabilities. No longer is the medical approach valid,
 whereby we are viewed as objects of charity, medical treatment and
 social protection.
</p>
<p> 
 The Convention demonstrates that a shift is underway towards viewing
 persons with disabilities as holders of rights. We are individuals who
 can claim full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and
 fundamental freedoms and full participation in society.
</p>
<p> 
 There is also a second significant paradigm shift underway concerning
 the exercise of our rights in the use of information and communications
 technology (ICT).
</p>
<p> 
 The Convention has many provisions that impact the development,
 procurement and deployment of ICT products and services, including
 ICT availability, ICT affordability and ICT accessibility through
 Universal Design.
</p>
<p> 
 But it is one thing to have a law or policy, and another to implement it,
 as we saw in the US when we tried to implement accessible ICT
 practices.
</p>
<p> 
 In 1986 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to ensure
 that electronic and information technology would be accessible to
 persons with disabilities. But the prohibition against discrimination on
 the basis of disability in procurement was difficult to manage because
 there was no agreement as to what was meant by the accessible design
 of electronic and information technology.
</p>
<p> 
 And across the country, we were seeing our investments in assistive
 technology being torpedoed as software upgrades in mainstream
 technology destroyed compatibility and interoperability with assistive
 technologies in use by workers with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 It was not until 1998 - eight years after the ADA was enacted - that
 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by strengthening
 Section 508 through the Workforce Investment Act. It requires federal
 agencies to make their electronic and information technology
 accessible to people with disabilities, including all mainstream
 technologies procured.
</p>
<p> 
 In taking this action, it was recognised that we had to strengthen US
 law to define what was meant by accessible design and that we had to
 create marketplace incentives for businesses. This civil rights
 procurement law was fashioned as a way to enable businesses to
 recover their investment in accessibility and at the same time enable us
 to lower the cost of expensive customisation.
</p>
<p> 
 The US effort was only the beginning of what would become a global
 one. Japan, for instance, has been busy addressing accessibility within
 the Japanese Industrial Standards.
</p>
<p> 
 And at around the same time, in 1997, the World Wide Web
 Consortium launched the Web Accessibility Initiative, which has led to
 a number of valuable resources including its web accessibility
 guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 We also saw the international standards-setting community becoming
 increasingly active. For example, since 2004 the ISO/IEC
 (International Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical
 Commission) JTC1 Special Working Group on Accessibility has been
 mapping accessible ICT standards worldwide. For the first time a
 systemic review of worldwide standards is underway to identify
 standards and to analyse gaps in standards.
</p>
<p> 
 Another significant international activity of interest is the effort
 underway due to the European Commission Mandate 376 to European
 Standardisation Organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 Recognising the need for a public procurement policy and practice for
 accessible information and communications technology, the mandate
 was launched to develop a solution for common requirements and
 conformance assessment in accessible ICT. It is expected that this
 effort in due course will result in a European standard for accessibility
 requirements in the ICT domain to be used as technical specifications.
</p>
<p> 
 So there is no question that an accessible ICT paradigm shift is
 underway. But now, back to the future. If the UN Convention is to
 succeed, then its monitoring provisions need to be followed. The
 Convention requires the signatory states to designate focal points
 within each country to assist in implementation and monitoring.
</p>
<p> 
 I encourage you to find out who the designated focal points are in your
 country and to contribute your voice to the Convention implementation
 effort and the country Monitoring Report. Cross-disability
 representation is vital in all sectors to ensure &quot;Nothing about us,
 without us.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The recent and ongoing controversy over the Kindle 2, an electronic
 book reader with a text-to-speech feature which has been embroiled in
 a row over royalties from what some see as a new 'audio book' format,
 reminds us that the accessible ICT paradigm shift is fragile and can be
 broken.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, I believe that ICT innovation embracing accessibility will
 bring a future of inclusiveness and economic sustainability, with
 greater percentages of persons with disabilities working and
 contributing to society. The Convention provides us with a framework
 for policy and implementation. But this cannot happen without
 universal design training in our schools and public policy awareness
 across disciplines so that our workforce is knowledgeable about
 accessibility and the Convention obligations.
</p>
<p> 
 Our investment in accessibility should be no different from any other
 ICT requirement. An accessible future is coming because technology
 changes, but civil rights do not.
