<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i109-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Visual Memory Is Key To Use Of Graphic Interfaces.</h3>
<p> 
 New research has found it is easier for blind computer programmers to
 use and develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) when they have
 previously been sighted and retain some visual memory. This memory
 helps programmers to visually represent GUIs, even if the interfaces
 themselves were designed after they had lost their sight, it found.
</p>
<p> 
 The research, termed the 'Combine project' (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/hayhoe1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/hayhoe1</a>
 ), was conducted by Dr. Simon Hayhoe, editor of the 'Eco' collaborative
 website on blindness and the arts.
</p>
<p> 
 GUIs are rapidly replacing older text-based mainframe systems. These
 text-based systems were preferred by programmers who had no visual
 memory and so had never experienced GUIs.
</p>
<p> 
 Hayhoe told delegates at last week's BETT 09 educational technology
 conference in London that social and cultural factors have also
 influenced opinion on blind people, often causing them to be
 underestimated and limiting educational opportunities. There are also
 generational and educational factors in how blind people work with
 new technologies. &quot;We can't think of blindness as just a perceptive
 problem&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The ongoing research project surveyed a group of computer
 programmers registered as blind; those born blind; those with
 assimilated blindness (someone who went blind during the period of 4-
 18-years-old); and those with visual memory (people going blind in
 adulthood).
</p>
<p> 
 Participants were asked whether they used text-based programming
 environments or GUIs, and for the latter, how these were represented
 or imagined by the individual, for example with the use of visual
 metaphors to navigate the system.
</p>
<p> 
 The work could help inform future interface design, Hayhoe said.
 Areas he hopes to address in a second phase of the study include the
 motivations of blind students who become programmers, and whether
 it is common for programmers with visual memory to reject the use of
 Braille. This last point arises after the case studies of those with visual
 memory showed that they preferred to use suitably adapted mainstream
 methods to understand programming languages.
</p>
<h3 id="i109-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Tech Industry Slams 'Fragmented' Eu Inclusion Policy.</h3>
<p> 
 The lack of a coherent approach to boosting technology accessibility
 across European nations has been attacked by a leading technology
 industry spokesman.
</p>
<p> 
 Mark McGann, Director General of the European Information,
 Communications and Consumer Electronics Technology Industry
 Association (EICTA), told the recent European Commission Vienna
 conference on digital inclusion that the lack of a cohesive approach in
 this field has been &quot;a massive failure&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 He said the situation with accessibility was similar to that found with
 the switchover to digital television, which has happened in a
 fragmented fashion across Europe. &quot;Too often we don't have one
 Europe, a single market. We have been advocating a single European
 approach to switchover for years.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Governments need to set a regulatory framework for accessibility,
 McGann said, but &quot;we don't want 27 policies&quot; - policies should be
 unified and co-ordinated at a European level.
</p>
<p> 
 Both the unified and national policies should focus on the goals of
 accessibility, not the specific means of attaining them, he said. &quot;We do
 not recommend that individual governments go into technologies or try
 to choose a technological winner, that would fail. [But] now more than
 ever, governments have an obligation to show leadership in this
 domain.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, there were positive signs, McGann said. With
 digital TV, for example, once the policy side becomes more co-
 ordinated, the technology itself &quot;will be much more accessible than
 analogue ever was.&quot;
</p>

<p> 
 The National Trust, the British Museum and the V&amp;A are among the
 recipients of last month's annual Jodi awards for excellence in
 accessible cultural websites and digital media (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/jodi2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/jodi2</a>

<p> 
 The British Museum won the Excellence in Web Accessibility Award
 for its BSL Schools Web Project (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bm1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bm1</a>
 ). The museum worked with the Frank Barnes Primary School for deaf children in London to produce videos
 for some of the exhibits in British Sign Language (BSL).
</p>
<p> 
 The Excellence in Accessible Digital Media Award was scooped up by
 the National Trust for a series of accessible virtual tours. Some 14
 tours are currently active and a further eight are still in development by
 the Trust's partner in the project Corvidae (
 <a href="http://corvidae.co.uk/panoramas/">http://corvidae.co.uk/panoramas/</a>

<p>  Local IT accessibility and special educational needs experts and professionals must be allowed to be involved closely with
 local council's projects to build new schools under the government's
 Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, the charity
 AbilityNet has warned. In a statement released at this month's
 education technology conference BETT 09, AbiltyNet said BSF was a
 wonderful opportunity, but it also presented &quot;huge potential pitfalls&quot; if
 the needs of pupils with disabilities and SEN are overlooked in the
 planning stages of school building projects:

<p>  A new version of the 'Talklets' talking web page system from Textic includes real-time spoken translation of
 English text into French, Spanish, German, Polish or Chinese. The
 system - which embeds code into participating websites to access
 software on the company's servers - uses the Google translation
 feature to create a written translation and then converts this into
 speech. Word and pdf documents can also be translated into foreign
 speech, and further languages are promised in 'the near future':

<h3 id="i109-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: DOUBLE OPT-IN:</h3>
<p>  Tedd Sperling, a freelance programmer based in the US and frequent correspondent to E-Access Bulletin on the
 inaccessibility of most 'CAPTCHA' tools (the distorted visual or audio
 codes users of some websites must decode to register).
</p>
<p> 
 Further to the report in our November issue of a talk given by Robin
 Christopherson of AbilityNet, referring to problems with registering on
 the Google website, Tedd writes: &quot;As you may remember, I've given
 the CAPTCHA 'need' quite a bit of thought and investigation over the
 years. I've written all sorts of CAPTCHAs, including an audio one.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;However, my current solution is simply an automated double-opt-in
 method for anyone wanting to post a comment, as can be demonstrated
 here:
 <a href="http://sperling.com/four-things-clients-should-know.php">http://sperling.com/four-things-clients-should-know.php</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I don't think this method is too much to ask of users and I don't think
 it is inaccessible. Additionally, this method throws the burden of
 banning posters onto my shoulders and not on the user by making them
 pass a CAPTCHA test.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;A double opt-in list is simply an email confirmation process that must
 be completed before allowing a person to post to a site. If a person
 wants to make a comment, they first submit their email address to the
 form at the bottom of any article. The form then records the email
 address given in a database; and emails a 'token' (a unique string of
 numbers and letters) to the user as part of a link.
</p>
<p> 
 If the user clicks the link they are taken back to the web site and their
 email address is confirmed. After that, whenever they want to post,
 they can do so without hindrance.
</p>
<p> 
 If a spammer wants to post something, then they don't normally go
 through the confirmation process. However, if they do and I don't like
 the post, then I simply ban the IP [internet address]. Thus far, it's
 worked for me.&quot;

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 Free and open source software have revolutionised ICT. In the public
 sector, an increasing number of bodies are making use of these
 technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 Cost is the main driver, since open source software has few of the costs
 and licensing restrictions of traditional software. However, the area is
 complex, and the savings analysis - taking into account training, full
 cost of ownership, and other issues - can lead to confusion.
</p>
<p> 
 Our masterclass can help. In our unique open source software overview
 training course aimed at the public sector, Nick Mailer unpicks the
 major controversies and myths surrounding free and open source
 software.
</p>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special Report- Access To The Web.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Quality, Not Quantity.- By Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 Voluntary guidelines on web accessibility are all very well, but there is
 nothing like a law for ensuring everyone falls into line. Such was the
 message to emerge from last month's European Commission
 conference on digital inclusion held in Vienna.
</p>
<p> 
 Alexander Fase, Web Guidelines Project Manager at the Dutch
 government ICT agency ICTU, told delegates that his organisation had
 developed a non-technical, 'quality' approach to accessibility standards
 which focused on ensuring all information could be accessed through
 any channel, now and in the future.
</p>
<p> 
 Such an approach was vital in an ageing society, he said: it was
 estimated for example that the number of people in Holland aged over
 55 would double by 2030, and the number of people with some level of
 impaired vision would double by 2020.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Old-school websites are only re-usable in a limited way - they are
 technologically complicated, and you had to redesign for a new
 corporate identity,&quot; Fase said. By contrast, the quality approach tries to
 ensure information will be available in the future, regardless of the
 emergence of new browsers and access devices. The approach is based
 around 125 quality requirements including keeping structure and
 design as separate as possible; and building websites according to the
 principle of 'layered design' (see
 <a href="http://www.webguidelines.nl">http://www.webguidelines.nl</a>
 ). His unit is also working on a business case for accessibility, to be
 published in 2009, Fase said.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the most powerful statistics offered by Fase was that of the
 increase in accessibility of central government websites in Holland
 since it became a legal requirement. &quot;Now web guidelines are
 mandatory, the score on accessibility is 10 times better than average,&quot;
 he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Matt May, Accessibility Engineer with Adobe Systems, agreed that the
 increasing use of multiple channels and devices to access web content
 meant that the basic requirements of what has been seen as
 accessibility for people with sensory impairments or disabilities are
 actually important for everybody.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I'm using a small notebook with a limited display so adjustment of
 text size is a universal issue now.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 It is also vital to realise that most people creating web pages do not
 actually use HTML, but rather intermediary 'authoring tools' such as
 Dreamweaver or Microsoft Word; programming tools; database-
 backed tools; or user-generated content, May said. &quot;Today, many
 people are creating web content but may have never seen the code,&quot; he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 This means that the World Wide Web Consortium's 'ATAG'
 guidelines on the accessibility of web authoring tools are just as
 important as the consortium's better-known web content accessibility
 guidelines, (WCAG) he said. &quot;As an industry, standards are very
 important to us, because we can take them to our developers.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 One case study of a major European retail website which was given an
 accessibility overhaul found that even the largest and busiest sites can
 be improved without major disruption.
</p>
<p> 
 Voyages-SNCF, the ticket purchasing website of the French national
 railway, is the leading online retailer in France, turning over 1.86
 billion euros of revenue in 2007 from some 700,000 daily users.
</p>
<p> 
 Christelle Lortet, e-Accessibility Project Officer at Voyages-SNCF,
 told the conference that accessibility had been a goal for the site for
 several years, with improvements made steadily as parts of the site
 entered their natural upgrade cycle. The organisation also funded
 accessibility training for everyone involved, including web developers,
 graphic designers and Lortet herself, as project manager.
</p>
<p> 
 There were three main reasons for the move: &quot;It was our desire, and
 the law, and a competitive advantage.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Lortet had a powerful message for those who think that making a
 website accessible means that one has to change its look and feel to
 something less sophisticated: on two slides, she showed what the
 Voyages-SNCF website looked like before its accessibility overhaul,
 and what it looked like afterwards. The two pages looked almost
 identical, with some small colour changes to improve contrast: the
 huge majority of changes are hidden in the code, she said. &quot;This should
 convince any CEO who thinks that accessibility would force a
 company to change the design of its web page,&quot; she said.
