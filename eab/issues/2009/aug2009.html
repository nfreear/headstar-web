<h3 id="i116-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Academic Urges Shift From Accessibility To 'Adaptability'.</h3>
<p> 
 An approach to improving web access for people with disabilities
 based on 'adaptability' rather than 'accessibility' is urged by a leading
 academic in this month's E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Brian Kelly, UK Web Focus at UKOLN, the national digital library
 research body based at the University of Bath, says 'adaptability'
 adopts the UN Convention's view that disability results from the
 interaction between people with impairments and attitudinal and
 environmental barriers that hinder their participation in society.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Disability is therefore a social construct and not an attribute of an
 individual,&quot; Kelly says. &quot;In particular, resource accessibility is the
 matching of a resource to an individual's needs and preferences - and
 is not an attribute of a resource.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;This is a different philosophy from that which underpins the WAI
 [World Wide Web consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative]
 approach, which argues that universal accessibility can be provided by
 focusing solely on the individual web resource, the tools used to create
 the resource and the browsers used to access the resource.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The web adaptability approach does not reject the valuable guidelines
 which have been developed by WAI, Kelly says. &quot;Rather, the approach
 feels they should be regarded as guidelines which can be helpful in
 many but not all circumstances. It is essential that the WAI guidelines
 are used in a pragmatic fashion, and not as a series of inflexible rules.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The adaptability approach focuses on real-world deployment
 challenges rather than continuing to mandate use of guidelines
 independent of their context of use, the technical complexities of
 today's web environment, the rich diversity of uses made of the web
 and the differing individual users' needs and requirements, he says.
</p>

 accessibility see Section Three, this issue.

<h3 id="i116-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Application Opens Up Twitter To Disabled Users.</h3>
<p> 
 Keyboard-accessible links, audio cues and simplified layouts are some
 of the features present in 'Accessible Twitter', a new application under
 development to make the popular microblogging service more
 accessible to disabled users.
</p>
<p> 
 Users sign in to the application
 ( <a href="http://www.accessibletwitter.com/">http://www.accessibletwitter.com/</a>
 ) with their regular Twitter username and password and are then
 presented with a tweaked version of the service with improved
 usability and accessible alternatives to many features.
</p>
<p> 
 These include headings and page titles which are designed to work
 with screen-readers; a large default text size and high colour contrast
 for easy viewing; and audio cues to alert the user when the character
 limit of 140 is almost reached when writing a 'tweet'.
</p>
<p> 
 The application's creator, US-based web developer and accessibility
 advocate Dennis Lembree, told E-Access Bulletin he hopes Twitter
 will eventually incorporate the accessibility features he has highlighted
 in his work. He is not optimistic this will happen in the near future,
 however. &quot;I think very gradually [Twitter] may improve, but not
 [through] anything significant soon. Twitter is happy with other
 companies and developers using the API [application programming
 interface] and creating a wide variety of applications.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Lembree said that disabled users of technology were &quot;almost always&quot;
 overlooked by developers.
</p>
<p> 
 Though still in the 'alpha' development stage, Accessible Twitter is
 currently available for anyone to use and is supported by all major
 internet browsers. The 'beta' version of the application will include
 more of Twitter's features which have been adapted to increase their
 accessibility, including &quot;Open Authentication, uploading photos, and
 better error handling&quot;, said Lembree.

<h3 id="i116-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Survey Uncovers "Depressing Picture" For Employees.</h3>
<p> 
 A low level of accessibility found in internal ICT systems for staff is
 creating a &quot;depressing picture for employment of people with
 disabilities&quot;, according to a new survey carried out in conjunction with
 E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The research, conducted by Bloor Research with E-Access Bulletin
 and Ability Magazine, found private sector organisations have more
 accessible internal ICT systems than organisations in the public sector,
 with 44% of private sector companies surveyed having more than 70%
 of their internal systems accessible, compared with only 29% of public
 sector bodies surveyed.
</p>
<p> 
 Both sectors were asked how this picture is likely to change by the end
 of 2010. The private sector again came out on top, with 60% of
 respondents claiming that by the end of 2010 more than 70% of their
 systems will be accessible, compared to just 44% of public sector
 organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the overall picture is still a gloomy one for the job prospects
 of disabled workers, the survey finds. &quot;Although there is pressure to
 improve the internal systems, there will be a large number of systems
 that are still not accessible in 2011 and this will limit job
 opportunities,&quot; it says.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite its shortcoming in internal systems, the public sector was
 found to have a greater overall level of accessibility in its external
 systems. These differences are &quot;probably caused by the e-gov pressure
 for citizen access on the one side and inaccessible internal legacy
 systems in the public sector on the other,&quot; the survey finds.
</p>

<h3 id="i116-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Tactile Culture:</h3>
<p>  In last month's issue reader Margot Whitfield of the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada asked about information on
 tactile access to cultural exhibits.
</p>
<p> 
 Stefanie Armbrust of the UK's Office for Disability Issues says: &quot;I
 know that the British Museum (
 <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">http://www.britishmuseum.org/</a>
 ) does touch tours and handling sessions&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 And Rachel Ethier Rosenbaum, President of The Carroll Center for the
 Blind in Newton, Massachusetts and regular correspondent to E-
 Access Bulletin, says: &quot;We at the Carroll Center worked extensively
 with the museums in Boston in the 1970s and 1980s to create
 accessible opportunities to blinded persons, using gloves to touch
 sculptures etc.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Ellie Rubin at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) took this to heart and
 implemented a good system . . . I do not know if they have continued
 to provide these tactile experiences. You can check with them. We also
 worked with the Museum of Science in Cambridge.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 After checking with the MFA at Rachel's suggestion, we received a
 prompt response from Hannah Goodwin, Manager of Accessibility.
 She writes: &quot;The program here at the MFA for people who are blind or
 have low vision is alive and well...and expanding. We access all of
 the collections and temporary exhibits, working with all art, including
 that which cannot be touched.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We have regular partnerships with a few groups, and have irregular
 visits from other groups, and lots of individuals, including visitors who
 have become members. We have a few volunteers who are blind. We
 try really hard to make sure our members' events and all of our family
 programs are fully inclusive.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 [Further responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i116-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Museum Challenge:</h3>
<p>  As a follow-up query on access to museums, Linda Woodbury of San Diego, California writes: &quot;If anyone has
 information on audible descriptive services in museums, will you
 publish that. . . certainly not the type that a sighted person listens to as
 he or she walks around. Instead, [I am looking for] in depth
 descriptions of paintings etc.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I live in a city with many, many museums, boasting of 'best practices'
 and 'must-see exhibits'. Yet, it's not an option for me as a totally blind
 individual to enjoy a day (even the 'free Tuesdays') due to lack of
 access.&quot;

<h3 id="i116-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: TV Input:</h3>
<p>  Also in last month's issue, Flávia Oliveira Machado, a degree student from Brazil, wrote to ask for input with her dissertation
 about TV audio description.
</p>
<p> 
 Rachel Ethier Rosenbaum of The Carroll Center for the Blind (see
 'Tactile Culture', above) says: &quot;The American Foundation for the
 Blind in NY conducted research for the US department of Education
 on the effectiveness of audio description done by WGBH in Boston
 with the at least five million Dollars provided to WGBH by the US
 government.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 And Joan Greening, Development Officer, Royal National Institute of
 Blind People, suggested that Flávia consults the institute's relevant
 web resources at:
 www.rnib.org.uk/audiodescription .

<h3 id="i116-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: BBC Obstacles:</h3>
<p>  James Wright, a reader from the West Midlands, UK, writes in to ask: &quot;Have you tried the obstacle course of trying to
 get around the BBC iPlayer? I am amazed at what a maze it is trying to
 find the correct programme and download it. Even the simpler task of
 listening to a radio programme can be hit and miss and very daunting
 to blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Why is it that these huge corporations seem unable to satisfy the
 needs of blind and disabled users? It appears that the larger the body,
 the more difficult they find it to provide easy accessibility. Surely I am
 not alone, surely there are other blind people out there wrestling with
 this iPlayer problem.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I look forward to the day when as well as a link to a contents page
 there is a link to a blind users' screen-reader page. Is it too much to
 hope that technology will be able to advance to this aspiration in the
 not too distant future?&quot;

<h3 id="i116-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Audiobook Query:</h3>
<p>  Ken Ingham, President of Amazability in Waban, Massachusetts, is trying to track down a piece of research on
 audiobooks and reading by audio. He says: &quot;Some time ago I saw a
 study done in England which indicated that a relatively large
 percentage - around 18% of the UK population - strongly preferred to
 read by audio. Reasons beyond visual impairment included other
 disabilities but also an unwillingness to stare at screens, and so on.
 Unfortunately, I did not keep a copy and now would like to review it
 and talk to the authors. Do you know anything about this and, if so, can
 you let me know where to find the study?&quot;

<p>  Mark Pimm, a reader from the UK, writes in with a query about using the popular JAWS screen-reader. &quot;I wonder if
 I could ask a favour: would you be able to suggest a manual (free or
 even one which you pay for) which explains to blind JAWS users how
 to access the World Wide Web. I am looking for something very, very
 simple (I saw some pages on [one] website which left me totally

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Web Research- Adaptability Versus Accessibility.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Time To Be Flexibleby Brian Kelly.
</h3>
<p> 
 To achieve universal accessibility for their web resources, surely all
 that organisations need do is implement the international Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines (in particular the WCAG
 guidelines for web content)?
</p>
<p> 
 Sadly the evidence, such as the recent Better Connected 2009 survey
 from the local government Society of IT Management (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6</a>
 ), demonstrates that public sector organisations are failing to implement
 these guidelines. But rather than calling for a renewed effort to
 implement the WAI model, perhaps an alternative approach is needed:
 a move from web accessibility to web adaptability.
</p>
<p> 
 This would begin by adopting the UN Convention's view that
 disability results from the interaction between persons with
 impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder
 their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with
 others (see
 <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=260">http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=260</a>
 ). Disability is therefore a social construct and not an attribute of an
 individual. In particular, resource accessibility is the matching of a
 resource to an individual's needs and preferences - and is not an
 attribute of a resource.
</p>
<p> 
 This is a different philosophy from that which underpins the WAI
 approach, which argues that universal accessibility can be provided by
 focusing solely on the individual web resource, the tools used to create
 the resource and the browsers used to access the resource.
</p>
<p> 
 The WAI approach does have its merits in a number of areas, such as
 the simple provision of informational resources. But the approach fails
 in other areas, such as the development of e-learning services in which
 the purpose if the service - learning - is not a function of the resource
 itself, but of the way in which it may be used and experienced. The key
 aim in this instance would be to ensure that the learning objectives are
 made accessible and not necessarily the e-learning resources
 themselves.
</p>
<p> 
 This approach leads to the notion of 'blended learning', in which both
 real world, web-based and other IT solutions may be used to provide
 an appropriate solution to the end user. And this appropriate solution
 can reflect the end user's personal preferences and learning styles - an
 approach which treats the user with disabilities on an equal basis with
 others, as advocated by the UN Convention's view on disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The web adaptability approach builds on our initial work at UKOLN -
 the national digital library research body based at the University of
 Bath - in addressing the accessibility of e-learning resources. Our 2004
 paper, 'Developing a holistic approach for e-learning accessibility' (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ukoln1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ukoln1</a>
 ), described how it can be applied in other contexts based on four case
 studies. These cover support for users with learning disabilities, with
 an approach taken to engage the end users in the design and
 development of the system; adaptability for the deaf, which illustrates
 the inappropriateness of the medical model of disabilities which
 underpins the WAI approach; adaptability in a government context,
 which examines the challenges of applying best practices when faced
 with limited resources and timescales; and adaptability and
 institutional repositories, which recommends an approach based on
 advocacy and education on ways of enhancing the accessibility of
 research publications, together with research into innovative ways of
 enhancing the accessibility of the resources themselves.
</p>
<p> 
 It is important to note that the web adaptability approach overall does
 not reject the valuable guidelines which have been developed by WAI.
 Rather, the approach feels they should be regarded as guidelines which
 can be helpful in many but not all circumstances. It is essential that the
 WAI guidelines are used in a pragmatic fashion, and not as a series of
 inflexible rules.

 The paper concludes by making a case &quot;for the adoption of a web
 adaptability approach which incorporates previous approaches and,
 perhaps more importantly, embraces the future, including technical
 innovations, differing perceptions of what is meant by accessibility and
 real world deployment challenges.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Isn't this an approach which public sector organisations should be
 adopting? And in the light of cutbacks in funding for the public sector,
 isn't it essential that we recognise such real-world deployment
 challenges rather than continuing to mandate use of guidelines
 independent of their context of use, the technical complexities of
 today's web environment, the rich diversity of uses made of the web
 and the differing individual users' needs and requirements?
