<h3 id="i115-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Rnib Team Welcomes Off-The-Shelf Iphone Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 An advanced screen-reader and other accessibility features on a new
 version of Apple's iPhone represent an &quot;extremely significant
 development&quot; for a previously inaccessible technology, according to
 the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).
</p>
<p> 
 'Off-the-shelf' features built into the iPhone 3GS allow blind and
 visually impaired users to send and receive text messages and emails,
 browse the internet, play music and make and receive phone calls.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'VoiceOver' screen-reader on the new phone also claims to be the
 world's first &quot;gesture-based screen-reader&quot;, working with the iPhone's
 touch-screen to describe or read out whatever function or piece of text
 the user moves their finger over, in any of 21 different languages. This
 allows users to read emails or text messages, and a 'Speak Auto-text'
 function will speak out letters or words being typed on the phone,
 suggesting possible corrections as it proceeds.
</p>
<p> 
 A further gesture-based 'rotor' system activated with a circular motion
 of the fingers switches the screen-reader mode backwards and forwards
 between word-by-word speech and reading out individual characters.
 Additionally, a voice control function allows users to make and receive
 calls, play and control music through voice commands.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB says Apple has taken &quot;a positive step&quot; by building-in these
 features for free. &quot;All too often, blind and partially sighted people have
 to rely on third-party assistive technology software and hardware in
 order to make mainstream devices such as mobile phones accessible&quot;,
 said Kiran Kaja, from the RNIB's digital accessibility team. &quot;This
 involves an additional cost for the user. But with Apple providing a
 free VoiceOver screen-reader on all iPhone 3GS devices, blind and
 partially sighted customers can now benefit from an off-the-shelf
 accessible mobile phone at the same price as their sighted
 counterparts.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Other accessibility features on the 3GS include a zoom function that
 can dramatically magnify the entire screen of any application; an
 option to change the screen display to white on black, offering higher
 contrast; easily discernible tactile buttons to perform basic phone
 operations; and an option to use giant font sizes when reading emails.
</p>
<p> 
 While praising these features, Kaja said there were one or two areas
 where further improvements could yet be made. &quot;While the iPhone
 3GS includes very good accessibility features, RNIB would like Apple
 to continue to look at making the iPhone usable by those who may not
 be as technically savvy. They also have a role to encourage third-party
 application developers to make their applications compatible with
 VoiceOver.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 On its website, Apple states that it is &quot;working with iPhone software
 developers so they can make their applications VoiceOver
 compatible.&quot;

<h3 id="i115-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Deafblind Web Users Engage With Social Media.</h3>
<p> 
 Social media users are being invited to think about the internet in terms
 of touch, taste and smell, to raise awareness of deafblindness and
 encourage deafblind people to use social networking sites, in a project
 from the deafblind charity Sense.
</p>
<p> 
 An online 'Sensehub' portal ( <a href="http://www.sensehub.org.uk/">http://www.sensehub.org.uk/</a>
 ) has been created for Sense on a pro bono basis by advertising and digital agency
 RMG Connect, allowing visitors to link to sense-based channels on
 sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. On the Twitter channel,
 for example, visitors can view streams of Tweets which contain words
 like 'touch', 'taste' and 'smell', while the Facebook link takes visitors
 to a group which encourages people to tag their photos with sense-
 based words, rather than just people's names.
</p>
<p> 
 Alessandra Moscadelli, New Media Co-ordinator for Sense, said the
 Sensehub was created to &quot;promote Deafblind Awareness Week to a
 young, traditionally reluctant audience, but also to draw attention to the
 fact that someone who is deafblind has extreme problems accessing a
 lot of the info on these websites.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 As well as encouraging more deafblind communities to use social
 networking and pushing developers to create more accessible
 applications, Sense hopes that the Sensehub will also connect users.
 &quot;We wanted to link individual web audiences with each other - the
 audience who already have experience of deafblindness to those who
 are discovering it for the first time, forming a community to encourage
 a sharing of content and experiences and further raising awareness&quot;,
 said Moscadelli.
</p>
<p> 
 The Sensehub interface has proved popular so far, receiving around
 2,500 hits in ten days, as well as an increase in the hub's Facebook and
 Twitter channels. Though difficult to measure at such early stage,
 Moscadelli estimates that when group links and numbers of 'friends'
 and 'followers' on social media sites are considered, the Sensehub may
 have reached up to 64,000 people.

<h3 id="i115-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Outdated 'Legacy' Systems Hindering Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 A lack of accessibility in old ICT systems and lack of budget are the
 two main barriers preventing organisations from making their internal
 and external ICT systems more accessible for people with disabilities,
 according to the results of the new survey.
</p>
<p> 
 These factors were each cited by 40% of respondents as 'strong' or
 'very strong' barriers to implementation of accessibility in a survey
 carried out by Bloor Research in conjunction with E-Access Bulletin's
 publisher Headstar and Ability Magazine. The finding suggests that
 providing tools for improving the accessibility of these 'legacy'
 systems could be an interesting business opportunity, say the survey's
 creators. Less than a quarter of respondents quoted lack of
 understanding of accessibility issues as a barrier to progress.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey, which questioned organisations from both the public and
 private sector, investigated the current and planned status of
 organisations' ICT systems and identified the drivers for accessibility;
 barriers to progress; and what needs to be done to remove these
 barriers.
</p>
<p> 
 Other findings included that &quot;meeting legal requirements&quot; and
 &quot;enhancing corporate social responsibility&quot; were the two main drivers
 behind ICT accessibility. The survey also revealed that, in general, the
 public sector is more committed to ICT accessibility than the private
 sector (as noted in E-Access Bulletin's sister publication, E-
 Government Bulletin:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=226">http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=226</a>

<h3 id="i115-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Brick Wall:</h3>
<p>  David Bates, a reader from Dudley in the West Midlands, UK, writes in to describe a frustrating experience he had
 recently in trying to access information on the website of a major
 company; British Telecom.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Although I am now blind and use a JAWS screen-reader, I foolishly
 decided to access a short business article from a BT Business
 Newsletter,&quot; he writes. &quot;The website pages were not accessible, so I
 moved to BT.com in order to report this problem.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I imagine that there is an accessibility page somewhere which can be
 found by sighted people, but I couldn't find it because general
 accessibility was so poor. I then decided to enter my question in the
 help section, but asking a computer why it is not accessible seems to
 confuse it, and it asked for the question to be rephrased, several times.
 I was no match for the computer at this game, so I clicked on an email
 link which would allow me to send a message, or to unsubscribe.
 Apparently, the receiving computer does not read messages, so it was
 pleased to tell me that I would be unsubscribed.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Not to be defeated, I then phoned 150, and after ten minutes of
 trawling through all of the options, I decided to take the deluxe
 experience of waiting to speak to a Real Person (apparently, BT have
 several of these).
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The lady was very helpful but she couldn't find anything about
 accessibility or give me a number for the people who operate the
 website. She then looked on BT.com but could find no helpline other
 than Emma, the computer who had failed to understand me an hour
 earlier.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I presume that the BT web designers occasionally interrogate their
 website with a software programme, which awards them with the
 required number of Brownie points, which of course makes everything
 OK.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;And I suppose web designers want to create cool, exciting sites, and
 do not want to be hassled by blind people who are so inconsiderate as
 to try to run businesses, or to access websites - and then expect them to
 be accessible? Or am I misjudging British Telecom?&quot;

<p> 
 11: 'Just The Right Thing To Do'
 by Peter Abrahams
</p>
<p> 
 In the past year or two it has been possible to detect heightened
 awareness of the need for accessibility of ICT products and services.
 This has partly been brought about by court cases such as that filed
 against Target.com in the US, where the National Federation of the
 Blind claimed that the company's website was inaccessible and
 violated disability legislation (
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=206">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=206</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Other factors increasing awareness of accessibility issues include new
 standards such as the updated Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 2.0; increased pressure from governments to make e-government
 services accessible to all; and the ongoing ratification of the UN
 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (
 <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 These drivers are complemented by the realisation that in the sluggish
 depths of the current economic slowdown, organisations need to reach
 out to as wide a customer base as possible. Two ways of doing this are
 to improve your brand image by being seen to take your social
 responsibilities seriously; and to make your products and services
 reach out to a wider audience by including the specific needs of groups
 such as the young, the old, the underprivileged, those with disabilities,
 and the cash-rich but time-poor.
</p>
<p> 
 In this light, accessibility is one significant part of a larger drive that
 comes under the title of inclusivity or design for all. If ICT systems are
 going to be available to the widest possible audience, then this must
 include making them accessible to people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 It is also the case that the process of designing for people with
 disabilities will highlight requirements that will help a much wider
 audience. For example, ease of navigation of a web site is essential to a
 person using a screen-reader or a dictation system, but the extra care
 put into the structure of the site to benefit this group will benefit other
 groups such as those who have not used computers before or those who
 have time pressures.
</p>
<p> 
 With all these factors in mind, Bloor Research's Accessibility Practice,
 in conjunction with E-Access Bulletin's publisher Headstar and Ability
 Magazine, have just completed a survey of attitudes to ICT
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey investigated the current and planned status of
 organisations' ICT systems and identified the drivers for accessibility;
 the barriers that were slowing down the implementation of accessible
 systems; and the actions that need to be taken by the industry to
 remove these barriers.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey, which questioned organisations from both the public and
 private sector, shows that the level of commitment to accessibility
 across organisations varies dramatically, with the bottom fifth of
 respondents showing little interest in or future plans for accessibility.
 In general, the public sector was found to be more committed to
 accessibility and had plans to improve further. This is not surprising, as
 'Section 508' accessibility legislation in the US and the Disability
 Equality Duty in the UK are aimed at the public sector's procurement
 of ICT. Furthermore, the public sector has a general duty to serve all
 the population and to be inclusive, whereas the private sector does not
 see accessibility as a duty.
</p>
<p> 
 Survey respondents were asked to state what they saw as the major
 drivers for accessibility within their organisations. Meeting legal
 requirements and enhancing corporate social responsibility were both
 rated strong or very strong drivers by 70% of the respondents, whereas
 only about 15% rated increased revenue or reduced cost as a driver.
 This suggests that further research is needed into the creation of
 business cases for accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey also asked for other suggestions for reasons or factors that
 might encourage accessibility. Among common themes emerging from
 this included that: &quot;It is just the right thing to do&quot;, and that
 organisations should &quot;lead by example&quot;. However, more pragmatic
 reasons also appeared, such as &quot;makes test automation easier&quot;, and
 &quot;improves search engine optimisation&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey then asked about barriers to implementation of
 accessibility. In response to this, 'legacy systems not being accessible'
 and 'lack of budget' were each cited by 40% of respondents as strong
 or very strong barriers. This suggests that providing tools for
 improving the accessibility of legacy systems could be an interesting
 business opportunity. Surprisingly, less than a quarter quoted lack of
 understanding or inadequacy of tools as a barrier.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, the survey asked an open question: &quot;Suggest one improvement
 to accessibility support&quot;; a question also asked at Headstar's recent e-
 Access 09 conference (
 <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess09/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess09/</a>
 ). Both conference and survey prompted many interesting suggestions,
 with one of the main themes being a need to increase awareness of the
 issues, barriers and benefits of accessibility across all the stakeholders
 (which includes users, procuring departments, and IT at all levels
 within an organisation). A quoted example of this problem involved a
 government department which was promoting accessible ICT to local
 businesses, while at the same time another department was promoting a
 non-accessible solution to the same businesses.
</p>
<p> 
 Other suggestions for accessibility support included better testing tools
 which are easier to use, and products that were accessible out-of-the-
 box.
</p>
<p> 
 The full results of the survey will be published on the Bloor website (
 <a href="http://www.bloorresearch.com/">http://www.bloorresearch.com/</a>
 ) in early July.
