<h3 id="i110-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: More Workplace Assistance Needed With It, Guide Warns.</h3>
<p> 
 Employers should do more to help disabled people with their IT
 workplace needs, according to a new guide from the Employers'
 Forum on Disability (EFD).
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Reasonable adjustments - line manager guide' (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/efd1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/efd1</a>
 ) advises employers to ensure they procure the correct equipment to
 ensure disabled workers can work to their full potential, including
 voice-activated software; adapted keyboards; and chairs which support
 the back and neck.
</p>
<p> 
 The guide includes example scenarios with solutions to common
 problems associated with disabilities in the workplace. One of the
 scenarios explores the difficulties that can occur from using IT
 equipment incorrectly including back and neck pain, and swollen
 wrists. Proposed solutions include an adaptor keyboard to place less
 strain on the user's wrists, a mouse which does not need to be grasped
 tightly and a chair adapted to suit the sitter's position.
</p>
<p> 
 Though focused on those with disabilities, the guide aims to maximise
 the potential of all employees, by increasing understanding of and
 adapting to the needs of disabled workers. It also sets out legal
 guidelines and helps employers identify what can and cannot be
 classed as a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 The EFD is a UK membership organisation helping businesses and
 companies to recruit disabled workers and providing services and
 products geared towards making the workplace more accessible.
</p>
<h3 id="i110-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Lost Weekend Spawns Accessible Facebook.</h3>
<p> 
 A tool to make the social networking site Facebook more accessible to
 visually impaired users has been created by Project:Possibility (
 <a href="http://www.projectpossibility.org/">http://www.projectpossibility.org/</a>
, a group of not-for-profit software developers in the US. The
 application (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/pp2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/pp2</a>
 ) allows visually impaired users to log in, navigate and use the site by
 combining screen reader technology with other coding techniques.
</p>
<p> 
 Brian D'Souza, a team member who worked on the project, explained:
 &quot;We leveraged an existing technology developed by Google called
 AxsJax (accessibility + AJAX) which combines use of screen readers
 and java script and navigation methods to make navigation and
 modification of content of webpages easier. It provides a lot of value
 for a blind person.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Facebook's popularity has risen dramatically in recent years, with
 more than 150 million users worldwide. However some users claim it
 does not fully support assistive tools, with several groups active on the
 site itself pressing for a more accessible service, such as The Official
 Petition for a More Accessible Facebook (
 <a href="http://en-gb.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2384051749">http://en-gb.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2384051749</a>
 ), which contains almost 1,500 members. Some measures have already
 been taken by Facebook to accommodate the needs of disabled users,
 such as releasing screen reader-friendly versions of some of its
 applications.
</p>
<p> 
 The Facebook tool was one of a series of projects created at the recent
 UCLA SS12, an annual 'code-a-thon' held at the University of
 California, Los Angeles. Software developers spend a weekend
 working on projects for disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Other projects developed by the same team at this year's SS12
 included Project AWE (
 <a href="http://projectpossibility.org/projects/handicapannotate/">http://projectpossibility.org/projects/handicapannotate/</a>
), a 'website accessibility tagging tool', which allows users and third
 parties to rate the accessibility of web pages. Ratings are automatically
 retrieving when the disabled user visits the page, allowing them to
 immediately gain an idea of how easy the page will be to navigate.
</p>
<h3 id="i110-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Navigational Device Wins International Research Prize.</h3>
<p> 
 A device installed in mobile phones to help blind and visually impaired
 people navigate from place to place has won the fifth International
 Research and Development Award in New Technologies for the Blind
 and Visually Impaired from ONCE (Spanish National Organisation of
 the Blind).
</p>
<p> 
 The prize of 240,000 Euros to help fund further research was won by
 the Shinobu Project, developed by the Human Communication and
 Interaction Research Group <a href="http://www.hci-rg.com/">http://www.hci-rg.com/</a>
 at the University of Oviedo in Spain.
</p>
<p> 
 The device allows users to choose the best path to their destination
 using public transport networks, by supplying information about the
 route as they travel. This includes live information about train and bus
 connections and details of possible points of interest to visit along a
 choice of alternative routes. The information is relayed to the user's
 mobile phone in real time.
</p>
<p> 
 ONCE received 58 applications for the latest award, from projects in
 14 different countries worldwide.

 Our 'Designing for all' course is a practical seminar designed to
 introduce organisations to the importance of designing accessible, easy
 to read information for a range of different audiences including older
 people and people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 In a society which now includes a large proportion of disabled people,
 people for whom English is not their first language and an ageing
 population, it is imperative that all your organisation's information is
 written and designed as accessibly and inclusively as possible. This
 includes both traditional media such as leaflets and reports, and new
 media such as the web.
</p>
<p> 
 Designing for all makes good business sense - boosting online sales
 and improving recruitment and retention; good ethical sense; and good
 legal sense.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Licence To Tweet- By Gez Lemon.
</h3>
<p> 
 [EDITOR'S NOTE: Twitter is a 'microblogging' system that allows
 people to supply a feed of very short messages, or 'tweets' - just 140
 characters long, to whoever subscribes to their feed. Subscribers can
 then reply openly with their own messages, or use the system to send
 private messages in reply. However, despite the fact that it is such a
 simple concept (and leaving aside for the moment the question of who
 has time to use it), the service raises various accessibility issues. Here,
 blogger Gez Lemon offers one innovative solution.]
</p>
<p> 
 Considering the standard Twitter website is so basic, it's surprising it is
 so inaccessible.
</p>
<p> 
 There are many accessibility problems with Twitter, but by far the
 biggest issue is the use of various links that can only be activated using
 a mouse. The links for making a particular tweet a favourite; the links
 for replying to a particular tweet; and the links to delete a tweet or
 direct message can only be activated using the mouse on the standard
 Twitter website. The favourite, reply and delete links are revealed
 when the user hovers the mouse over a tweet.
</p>
<p> 
 Hiding actions and only revealing them when the user moves the
 mouse results in a very poor user experience for everyone, since many
 mouse users will be unaware that the functionality exists at all. But for
 keyboard-only users, the situation is far worse, as they could never
 possibly know the functionality exists.
</p>
<p> 
 Twitter also offers a set of commands to use with Twitter updates,
 including an <a href="mailto:'@username'">'@username'</a> command to send a reply to a particular user. However, use of these commands from the keyboard does not
 offer the full functionality available to mouse users, who can click on
 function buttons.
</p>
<p> 
 The syntax for the manual command is <a href="mailto:'@username">'@username</a> message you want to send to the user'. While useful, there are two significant difficulties
 with this syntax.
</p>
<p> 
 First, the reply is associated with the last tweet the user sent. If the 
 user
 has sent tweets since the particular message a user intends to reply to,
 the reply is associated with the wrong tweet. By contrast, the reply is
 always associated with the correct tweet when using the mouse-
 operated reply button.
</p>
<p> 
 Second, the user has to physically type the username. As usernames
 aren't always simple to remember, the user sometimes has to copy and
 paste them. By contrast, the name is automatically put into the reply
 box with the correct syntax, and associated with the correct tweet,
 when a user hits the reply button.
</p>
<p> 
 So overall, using commands to manually send replies is not an
 equivalent for a button that does everything for the user.
</p>
<p> 
 There is also a manual 'FAV' command to make a tweet a favourite.
 The syntax is 'FAV username', which will make the last tweet by the
 user a favourite. But as with replies, the FAV command assumes you
 are talking about the very last tweet from a user, which may or may not
 be the case, and once again requires the user to type the username.
</p>
<p> 
 Keyboard-only users also cannot delete tweets or direct messages, as
 there are no manual commands for deletion.
</p>
<p> 
 So how to solve these problems?
</p>
<p> 
 In fact, there are so many accessibility issues with Twitter that I
 originally wanted to build an entire new accessible application for
 using Twitter. The problem is that I wouldn't have the bandwidth to
 run a server-side Twitter application, and Twitter doesn't currently use
 'OAuth', an open authorisation system that allows other applications to
 interact with it, without which I would have to ask users to trust me
 directly with their usernames and passwords.
</p>
<p> 
 When discussing this on Twitter, one correspondent Derek Feather
 suggested using 'Greasemonkey', a plug-in for the Firefox web
 browser that allows users to install scripts to change web pages. This
 was a good idea, as it at least allowed the biggest accessibility
 problems to be addressed immediately.
</p>
<p> 
 So it was that I wrote the 'Focus Twitter Greasemonkey' script. The
 script reveals Favorite, Reply and Delete links when appropriate for
 each tweet in the timeline. The link phrases have contextual
 information for assistive technology, but hidden visually, as the links
 are clearly grouped with the tweet to which they belong. I also
 removed the avatar from the keyboard tab order to reduce the number
 of redundant links for keyboard-only users, as the name immediately
 by the side of the avatar activates the same link. I have left the link in
 place so that mouse users have a larger target area, as they can click on
 the avatar.
</p>
<p> 
 If you don't already have Greasemonkey installed, you will first need
 to install Greasemonkey in Firefox first. After installing the extension,
 select the Focus Twitter Greasemonkey script, and you will be
 prompted to install the script. From then on, you will have access to
 reply, favourite and delete links using the keyboard.
</p>
<p> 
 This goes to show what's possible, but more needs to be done. Web 2.0
 has great promise, offering software developers the ability to get rich
 applications out to a wide audience on multiple platforms, but basic
 usability principles are often overlooked. Software developers have a
 responsibility to ensure their applications are accessible and usable by
 everyone, regardless of ability.
