<h3 id="i117-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Google Recaptcha Purchase Boosts Accessibility Potential.</h3>
<p> 
 The purchase by Google of reCAPTCHA, the most widely used
 'CAPTCHA' system on the internet, could lead to significant
 improvements in the system's accessibility, a leading analyst has told
 E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 'CAPTCHAs' are tests used to block 'robots' or automated tools from
 accessing websites by posing a task that only humans can complete.
 These tests are usually visual, such as interpreting and keying in
 distorted letters and numbers, but audio CAPTCHAs - where letters
 are read out for the user to input - are crucial for visually impaired
 users. The reCAPTCHA system includes audio tasks.
</p>
<p> 
 Lainey Feingold (
 <a href="http://lflegal.com/">http://lflegal.com/</a>
 ), a disability rights lawyer in the US, told E-Access Bulletin that with its
 considerable resources, Google - which itself already uses audio
 CAPTCHA tests on some features - have a prime opportunity to
 improve reCAPTCHA's accessibility. &quot;There is no excuse for the
 company not improving the reCAPTCHA audio features and making
 this the most accessible CAPTCHA on the internet today. Google also
 knows how to harness public opinion and end-user expertise, which
 they definitely should do here&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 To make these improvements, Google should create a focus group of
 end users who cannot use a visual CAPTCHA, said Feingold. The
 company should &quot;get extensive feedback from this group and
 implement the feedback - then get more feedback and implement that,&quot;
 she said.
</p>
<p> 
 In a joint statement on the official Google blog, Luis von Ahn, co-
 founder of reCAPTCHA and Will Cathcart, Google product manager,
 said: &quot;Improving the availability and accessibility of all the
 information on the internet is really important to us, so we're looking
 forward to advancing this technology with the reCAPTCHA team.&quot;

<h3 id="i117-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Bbc Opens Up Iplayer To Audio Description.</h3>
<p> 
 The BBC's hugely popular iPlayer software will now carry
 approximately 25 hours per week of the broadcaster's audio described
 TV programmes, giving visually impaired users access to a range of
 well-known shows including 'Dr Who', 'Little Britain' and some
 children's programmes.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio descriptions assist vision-impaired people by using gaps
 between dialogue to describe what is happening in a programme. Until
 now none of the BBC's audio described output has been available on
 the iPlayer but there are now plans to make all such programmes
 available on the system over the next few months, storing them in a
 new category on the iPlayer site (
 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/categories/audiodescribed">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/categories/audiodescribed</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Jonathan Hassell, head of audience experience and usability at the
 BBC, told E-Access Bulletin: &quot;The whole point of iPlayer is to allow
 our audiences to consume our programmes however, wherever and
 whenever they want. So for us to leave blind people out of this
 revolution in how people watch TV would go against our fundamental
 aim to make our content and services available to all licence fee
 payers, regardless of their age, abilities or disabilities.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The Royal National Institute of Blind People has described the move as
 &quot;a major breakthrough and great leap forward for blind and partially
 sighted people&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this month, the iPlayer also won the <a href="mailto:ACCESS-IT@Home">ACCESS-IT@Home</a>
 award (
 <a href="http://www.access-it-events.org/2009_access_it_awards.php">http://www.access-it-events.org/2009_access_it_awards.php</a>
 ) for best ICT-based project, product or service that advances
 independent living for people with disabilities or the elderly.

<h3 id="i117-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Australian Web Accessibility Reviews Open To All.</h3>
<p> 
 An online forum allowing anyone to become involved in accessibility
 reviews of major government and corporate websites has been
 launched in Australia.
</p>
<p> 
 No technical or specialist knowledge is needed to participate in the
 Australian Web Access Review (AWARe:
 <a href="http://www.aware.org.au/">http://www.aware.org.au/</a>
 ), which asks volunteers to evaluate the accessibility of prominent
 Australian websites by answering 13 questions, based around WCAG
 2.0 (the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
</p>
<p> 
 Set up by Media Access Australia (MAA:
 <a href="http://www.mediaaccess.org.au/">http://www.mediaaccess.org.au/</a>
 ), a not-for-profit organisation that provides information on technology
 access issues, AWARe posts review results on its website, which are
 then used to drive change within industry and government. MAA say it
 will &quot;actively pursue websites highlighted as inaccessible by AWARe
 reviews&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 MAA new media manager Scott Hollier told E-Access Bulletin that
 AWARe provides a way for anybody to comment on website
 accessibility. &quot;In the past this has been difficult due to the technical
 nature of accessibility audits, the cost involved in obtaining an audit or
 the fear of trying to approach a large organisation with an inaccessible
 website. AWARe addresses these concerns by giving people who face
 accessibility issues the opportunity to directly review them online, and
 discuss the issues in the forums&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the forum only reviews Australian websites, anyone from
 any country can participate in AWARe, which has already reviewed
 five government websites, including a disability services site,
 Centrelink (rated as only &quot;somewhat accessible&quot;); a flu pandemic
 information site; and a digital TV switchover site.

<h3 id="i117-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Healthy Apple?</h3>
<p>  Computer giant Apple has been recognised for its accessibility achievements in the National Federation of the Blind's
 first web accessibility day, held in the US earlier this month.
 Electronics store Newegg.com and General Electric were also
 recognised for their continued commitment to accessible web services.
 The day also featured workshops on creating accessible, legislation-

<p>  A portable device that allows blind users a degree of 'vision' through gentle electrical stimulation of the tongue looks set
 to be released by the end of the year by US company Wicab. The
 'BrainPort' translates pixelated information from a digital video
 camera into a tactile stimulation pattern which is 'painted' on the
 tongue. First unveiled in 2006, the BrainPort is now awaiting approval
 from the Food and Drug Administration, after which it will be released
 commercially for around 10,000 US Dollars:

<p>  A real-time online sign language interpretation service, originally created for the recent Deaf Olympics or
 'Deaflympics' in Taiwan, has been developed by IBM and the Chinese
 Deaf Association. Users install an application onto a laptop with
 wireless internet and a webcam, and can connect to the service when
 communicating with someone who doesn't know sign language. An
 interpreter from the web-based service centre then uses a webcam to
 sign:

<p>  A Scottish local government worker, David Thomas, has posted onto our 'E-Access Bulletin Live' blog to respond
 to last issue's article: 'Survey uncovers depressing picture for
 employees', which reported on poor internal ICT systems for staff in
 both public and private sector bodies.
</p>
<p> 
 David wrote: &quot;As a visually-impaired employee of a local authority
 within Ayrshire, I have to agree that accessible applications are given
 very little consideration. My council uses several applications within
 their customer service contact and IT department that are not
 accessible, and even when they updated their software packages no
 consideration was given to purchasing applications that were
 accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Even within social services, steps have not been taken to give visually
 impaired employees access to our client information system
 'CareFirst', despite the fact that CareFirst is and has been accessible
 since version 4. People like myself are therefore denied any
 opportunity of promotion because of such poor attitude towards the
 needs of disabled employees.&quot;

 ].</p>
<h3 id="i117-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Perplexing Piece:</h3>
<p>  In last issue's web research feature 'Adaptability Versus Accessibility: Time To Be Flexible' (issue 116,
 August 2009), Brian Kelly argued that in the real world a more flexible
 approach to accessibility is needed than slavishly following guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 Sailesh Panchang, a web accessibility specialist from Virginia in the
 US, wrote in to say the article left him &quot;perplexed&quot;. He wrote:
 &quot;Consider this sentence from the piece: 'The key aim in this instance
 would be to ensure that the learning objectives are made accessible and
 not necessarily the e-learning resources themselves'. This is like saying
 knowledge must be made accessible, but not the library (physical
 resource) that houses it.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The WAI (international Web Accessibility Initiative)
 recommendations are just guidelines, and they do not purport to be
 'inflexible rules'. The techniques are also not exhaustive and only
 illustrate what are known to work with current versions of browsers
 and assistive technologies. The web is an 'environment' too: it also
 presents attitudinal and environmental barriers for users with
 disabilities. One might understandably expect WAI to limit itself to
 recommendations that govern the accessibility of this environment. In
 doing so it must recognise the functional limitations faced by
 individuals with different types of disabilities so that it might make
 appropriate recommendations. And it does just that.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It is also unfair to say the medical model of disability 'underpins the
 WAI approach'. People with disabilities are active in various working
 groups of the WAI and fully understand that disability is a social
 construct. In promoting accessibility of web content, authoring tools
 and browsers and assistive technologies used for web access, WAI is
 trying to ensure that the web environment will have fewer hurdles and
 more choices for users with disabilities. One can adapt better if the
 surrounding environment and resources are accessible, right?&quot;

<p> 
 09: Twitter Chatter: Another reader, 'Lucas', commented online on our
 article about 'Accessible Twitter', a tool to improve access to the
 popular micro-blogging service. He said: &quot;I am using Twitter since two
 months ago. My first impression of the service was interesting, and I
 didn't find anything so inaccessible. When I saw the Accessible
 Twitter I was curious to see what they changed in this version, and
 when I tried it, it was uncomfortable.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The fact is: when you open your Twitter page, what you want to see
 are your friends' updates . . . Sometimes, you have a lot of tweets to
 read, so, a good interface is all you want to help you in this case. On
 Twitter, the first link will show you the name of the person, the second
 link will show you the account of the person (it's important to send
 them direct messages) . . . and then, finally, their tweets. The
 Accessible Twitter turned this simple thing [into] a strange
 presentation of the message. All the tweets are marked with a block
 quote, making you slow in the time you are reading the tweets. The
 information where on Twitter were organised in one line to show you
 the hour when this tweet was posted, how the person was posting it and
 so on, are separated by a lot of lines, making, again, you slow in the
 time you are reading your tweets.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;For me, I like the original Twitter, and I will keep using that.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However the Accessible Twitter application's creator, US-based web
 developer and accessibility advocate Dennis Lembree, responded
 shortly afterwards to defend his creation, saying: &quot;Accessible Twitter
 fixes [the following] issues (and more) in Twitter.com: the navigation
 is inconsistent, doesn't display username of account signed in, the
 Favorite and Reply links are STILL not keyboard accessible,
 JavaScript is required, doesn't work in Lynx browser, may be illegible
 due to custom colours, code is not standards-compliant, and so on.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Tweets are marked up as block quotes because they are block quotes;
 this is proper semantic coding. The rendering of that code is up to the
 user-agent (browser). There is more to do on Twitter than just post and
 read tweets. For example, Accessible Twitter provides a Trends page, a
 Popular Links page, and previews for images linked in tweets.&quot;

 10: Rotten Apple? Dan TeVelde posted a comment online on the
 article from our July issue: 'RNIB Team Welcomes Off-The-Shelf
 iPhone Accessibility', which covered the new iPhone's 'gesture-based'
 screen-reader, a 'world first'.
</p>
<p> 
 He said: &quot;I appreciate the article about the new phone but I wish Apple
 would enhance its technical support for its products. I couldn't get a
 live person when I called Apple directly. I also contacted my local
 Apple store and a clerk actually told me that the phone wasn't very
 accessible and that it might not be the best phone for me as a totally
 blind person. Apple needs to communicate more effectively with the
 blind community.&quot;

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Publications'Doing IT Differently'.

<p> 
 13: The Road To Achievement
 by Katherine Ledger.
</p>
<p> 
 A practical guide to help people overcome barriers to using IT and live
 an independent life, inexpensively, has been published by the Royal
 Association for Disability Rights (RADAR), the UK's leading pan-
 disability organisation. 'Doing IT Differently: Enabling everyone to
 use computer and information technology' is sponsored by the
 Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the
 Department for Business, Innovation and Skills), AbilityNet, Microlink
 and the Information Technologists Company.
</p>
<p> 
 Part of a series of self-help publications called Doing Life Differently,
 the booklet is for everybody at all levels of experience and ages who
 has problems accessing IT, so it is totally inclusive. It guides the reader
 through a host of jargon on how to choose and use personal computers,
 desktops, laptops, mobile phones, smartphones and TVs.
</p>
<p> 
 Mastering IT can help you improve job prospects, access training and
 education, shop, bank, save money, communicate with friends, have
 fun and be more independent.
</p>
<p> 
 Tony, 35, is one of several people with disabilities in our book who
 tells his story about how IT has helped him. &quot;I have a genetic condition
 which means my sight is steadily worsening. These days I really can't
 see anything at all. But I knew this was coming and learned to touch
 type in my teens. Over the years I've gone through every stage of the
 adaptation process. I began with changes of colour, character size, font
 choices and so on, using built-in options. Then I got an electronic
 magnifier so that I could use printed text and books in my studies and
 early work. Then I moved to a software magnification package with
 some output speech. Then, when my sight was no longer practical or
 efficient but was still possible, I moved to a screen reader. What do I
 do? I work as an IT consultant. Yes, deteriorating conditions can be
 handled efficiently these days.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I do most of my work remotely so I'm pretty sure that most of my
 contacts and customers - those who have not met my guide dog
 anyway - have no idea that I'm blind.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Joan, 73, similarly overcame her fear of computers. &quot;The trouble was
 that I was scared to touch it, in case I did something wrong and you
 can't ever learn anything without actually practising it. Going to a
 course at the local library really helped. I learned a lot but the main
 lesson I learned was that it is very difficult to do something seriously
 wrong. You can 'undo' or revert to the last version you saved.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Liz Sayce, RADAR CEO, says: &quot;There is no advice more useful than
 the tips that come from others who have trod the same road before.
 Whether it's getting or keeping a job, managing your money or getting
 online, doing life differently because of ill-health, injury or disability
 doesn't mean doing it less well.&quot;
