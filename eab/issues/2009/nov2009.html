<h3 id="i119-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Us Universities Reject 'Inaccessible' Kindle E-Book.</h3>
<p> 
 Two American universities have rejected the market-leading Kindle
 DX electronic book reader as a textbook replacement due to its
 inaccessibility for blind students. Both Syracuse University in New
 York State and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have chosen not
 to use the Kindle - manufactured by Amazon.com - as a teaching-aid,
 after their own trials found it was not fully accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The institutions' decision was &quot;applauded&quot; by the US National
 Federation of the Blind ( NFB: <a href="http://bit.ly/gBnAC">http://bit.ly/gBnAC</a>
 ), which said that although the reader contains a text-to-speech feature, &quot;the menus of the
 device are not accessible to the blind&quot;, meaning that blind users cannot
 purchase books from Amazon's Kindle store, select which book to
 read, or even activate the device's text-to-speech feature.
</p>
<p> 
 Ken Frazier, director of libraries for the University of Wisconsin-
 Madison, said in a statement that the DX's lack of accessibility had
 been a &quot;big disappointment&quot;, and that Amazon had &quot;missed the mark&quot;
 with this version of the device, after the university trialled the e-book
 format for assigned reading in a history seminar.
</p>
<p> 
 Since the two bodies' announcement a third US university, the
 University of Illinois, has also issued a statement announcing its
 commitment to purchasing fully accessible e-book technology. &quot;Like
 our colleagues at Wisconsin and Syracuse, we recognize the
 groundbreaking potential that read-aloud features have for making
 textbooks accessible to students with disabilities&quot;, the university said.
 &quot;Sadly, that potential can't be realized until vendors of e-book readers,
 like the Kindle, add accessible read-aloud menus and basic navigation
 to their products.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The NFB told E-Access Bulletin this month that if fully accessible, e-
 textbooks can benefit blind and visually impaired students. &quot;If e-books
 are accessible, then there will be no need for the expensive and time-
 consuming process of converting a printed textbook into Braille, audio,
 or electronic form. Blind students will have access to the same book at
 the same time and at the same price as their sighted peers&quot;, said Chris
 Danielsen, director of public relations for the NFB.
</p>
<p> 
 Danielsen said that Amazon could increase the accessibility of the
 Kindle DX by &quot;making the menus speak and/or by allowing the
 functions of the device to be controlled by keystrokes from the
 keyboard.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Amazon has already courted controversy in this area by allowing
 publishers to remove the text-to-speech function altogether on a
 previous version of the Kindle (see story in the March issue of E-
 Access Bulletin, <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ).</p>

<h3 id="i119-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: 'Podcasts From Past' On Cultural Access Prize Shortlist.</h3>
<p> 
 A Museum of London project recruiting and training unemployed
 people to describe objects in its collections and relay historical
 information into a series of podcasts, opening up some of the
 museum's collections to visually impaired visitors, is among
 shortlisted nominees for the 2009 Jodi Awards, which recognise best
 use of digital technology for disabled people in the arts, cultural and
 heritage sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 'Podcasts from the past' ( <a href="http://bit.ly/2IO1cw">http://bit.ly/2IO1cw</a>
 ) is joined on the shortlist by (among others) Leeds Library and Information Service, for
 its 'Across the Board' project ( <a href="http://bit.ly/8doq1F">http://bit.ly/8doq1F</a>
 ). The library offers a series of services and digital communication tools for autistic
 children and their parents, making it a more natural environment for
 those affected by autism.
</p>
<p> 
 Nominated websites are subject to user testing and automated testing to
 assess their value, while disabled assessors will visit shortlisted
 'onsite' projects. Marcus Weisen, director of the Jodi Mattes Trust,
 told E-Access Bulletin that this year's nominations were &quot;unusually
 strong and varied&quot;. Speaking about the International Award, he said:
 &quot;An impressive project on the shortlist . is Aangepast Lezen  (
 <a href="http://www.aangepast-lezen.nl/">http://www.aangepast-lezen.nl/</a>
 ), a Dutch project, which is a European pioneer for accessible digital libraries for print-impaired people.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The annual awards are named in honour of Jodi Mattes, who worked at
 the British Museum and the Royal National Institute of Blind People,
 championing wider cultural access for disabled people. The 2009 Jodi
 Awards will be presented by Martha Lane Fox, the government's
 champion for digital inclusion, on 2 December at the Victoria and
 Albert Museum in London.

<h3 id="i119-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: First Internet Web Radio Launched For Blind Users.</h3>
<p> 
 A new internet radio set has been developed for blind and visually
 impaired listeners, allowing people to listen online to audio books,
 podcasts, talking newspapers and audio catalogues, as well as internet
 radio stations from around the world.
</p>
<p> 
 Manufactured by the charity British Wireless for the Blind Fund (
 <a href="http://www.blind.org.uk">http://www.blind.org.uk</a>
 ), the 'Sonata' radio - claimed to be the first of its kind - was launched earlier this month, and allows users to listen
 to any streamable, unlicensed internet audio feed.
</p>
<p> 
 Designed to be as simple as possible to use, the Sonata is controlled
 entirely with five buttons. When connected to broadband internet, the
 radio contacts a server in Holland to allow readers to choose from a
 current list of available radio stations and podcasts.
</p>
<p> 
 Although built primarily for blind and visually impaired users and
 available to such users on free permanent loan, the Sonata is also
 suitable for other users, said Fiona Fountain, head of fundraising and
 information for the BWBF. &quot;It's so simple to use that anybody who has
 limited mobility - for example, older people with poor manual
 dexterity - or people who may not use computers can use it&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Fountain said the radio has other potential applications, as it has the
 potential to broadcast messages to other Sonata users such as news of
 other radio services. &quot;The BWBF could record its own message to tell
 people about a new service on Sonata,&quot; said Fountain. &quot;This means we
 can do it live, without having to write a letter, get it Brailled, or use
 large print or CD format, and then post it out, as we've had to do in
 past.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The concept for the Sonata originates from Holland, where churches
 used the system to enable the home-bound to listen in to their local
 church service. The company responsible for developing the product,
 Solutions Radio, realised it had wider applications and approached the
 BWBF to develop it for the UK market. For those not qualifying for a
 loan, the Sonata costs &pound;299 with a further one-off activation charge of
 &pound;52.

<p>  Only 44% of organisations believe their websites and other electronic communications channels are accessible
 to people with disabilities, and the issue remains a &quot;serious concern&quot;,
 according to a report by the Employers' Forum on Disability. 'The
 Disability Standard 2009 Benchmark Summary' surveyed 109

<p>  Guidelines for helping people create accessible media for the 'iTunes U' - a free part of the Apple iTunes Store featuring free
 audio and video educational resources such as lectures, language

<p>  Accessibility problems could soon be created for many websites following an amendment to a European telecoms
 bill, the 2003 Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive,
 which requires that sites ask visitors' permission to store and access
 'cookies', pieces of data that identify a particular user or computer to a
 site. However, both the main methods used by sites to request this
 permission - separate 'landing' pages that appear without warning, and
 'pop-up' pages - could potentially breach the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines, according to analysts 'The Pickards
 Information Services'. The amendment will be passed this month, but
 will not come into force for a further 18 months:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Focus- Disability and Virtual Worlds.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Universal Lifeby Kel Smith.
</h3>
<p> 
 Many of us use and enjoy virtual worlds such as Second Life for work
 and play, and there is a vital demographic of virtual world participants
 with a wide range of disabilities: visual impairments, motor skill
 disorders, degenerative illness, limited mobility, and cognitive
 difficulties.
</p>
<p> 
 Many of these people use virtual technology to great social and
 therapeutic benefit. For these users, avatar-driven 3D environments
 serve as more than a game. Virtual worlds operate as a form of
 augmented reality, one where it's possible to transcend a user's
 physiological or cognitive challenges into something extraordinary.
</p>
<p> 
 August 2008 marked the launch of Virtual Ability Island, an
 environment in Second Life created by the Alliance Library System
 (ALS) and Virtual Ability, Inc. (VAI) to help residents with disabilities
 become acquainted with the platform. Funded by a grant from the
 National Library of Medicine, the island provides a place for residents
 to find fellowship, training and education on topics related to physical
 disability, cognitive impairments or other chronic health concerns.
</p>
<p> 
 The island was designed visually and experientially to offer the best
 benefit to users with disabilities, fully available to adaptive services
 and developed in accordance with Universal Design principles. The
 island contains the following features: wide ramps scalable for avatars
 in wheelchairs; bright high-contrast signage more easily trackable by
 users with visual impairments; smoothly landscaped walkways to
 accommodate many types of users; and training offered in small sets to
 decrease fatigue.
</p>
<p> 
 Testing was performed in stages, with the first challenge being how to
 best present signage. Signs needed to be readable by the default camera
 view, which is angled downward at roughly 15 degrees from eye level,
 so all signs in the island's Orientation Centre were compensated for the
 height of avatars using wheelchairs. The standard view in Second life
 includes the avatar in the frame, so signs were placed high off the
 ground. Paths and walkways were designed with as few stairways as
 possible, with no bumps that would make an avatar trip while walking.
 The surrounding land was modelled to meet the paths as closely as
 possible.
</p>
<p> 
 The question could be asked: why is it necessary to implement such
 strict accessibility features in a virtual world? After all, no avatar in
 Second Life is actually physically disabled - why depict an avatar with
 a wheelchair or guide dog? Why emphasise such physical attributes in
 an environment as ramps and wide paths?
</p>
<p> 
 From a development standpoint, creating specification guidelines with
 universal design principles in mind has several benefits. It ensures a
 baseline modality for such tasks as listening to audio playback,
 viewing visual material, comprehending written information or
 interpreting the context of an event. One might argue that immersive
 environments should be governed by the same principles as other web-
 based media as governed by the W3C (The World Wide Web
 Consortium) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0); they
 need to be perceivable, intuitive, flexible, robust and extensible in use.
 If media is designed to accommodate users with challenges, the overall
 experience will be holistically improved for all users.
</p>
<p> 
 It is also important to realise that all digital applications, including
 virtual world environments, should be built to consider best practices
 in interface usability. Many first-time avatars have difficulty
 navigating virtual worlds with a mouse and keyboard, even with
 relatively minor hand and arm issues.
</p>
<p> 
 Anything that can make the screen easier to read or the cursor easier to
 move can benefit the user experience. For those who rely on voice
 recognition software or alternative input devices, a larger or brighter
 avatar on the screen can be more precisely controlled. Game interfaces
 are frequently designed to accommodate customisation; interface
 malleability is often programmed into the console to remap functions
 at the player's whim, and this personalisation is often extended to the
 presentation layer itself.
</p>
<p> 
 We must also consider the ways in which users of virtual worlds
 approach their disability. For some, it is largely a matter of respect.
 The appearance of accessibility is very important to many disabled
 users, who view their disability as an integral part of their identity.
 Simon Stevens, owner of a well-known disability consultancy in
 Coventry, UK, and a Second Life avatar named Simon Walsh, chooses
 to present himself in-world with a wheelchair.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I don't know how to be non-disabled and I've never wanted to be,&quot; he
 told the Times Online in March 2008. &quot;It's important that people
 know; it's part of who I am, plus I'm a disability consultant in Second
 Life, too, so I've got to look the part.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Depicting oneself with a disability can also be an issue of comfort
 resolved through personal customisation. People who have had an
 impairment since birth consider it a part of how they perceive
 themselves, and some prefer to have their avatar appear that way.
</p>
<p> 
 Creating a virtual world with universal design principles in mind
 serves as a visual reminder to help users better understand the needs of
 the disabled. The appearance of accessibility in a physical space, either
 in a virtual world or in real life, will make a person more likely to use
 the service. For someone with a physical disability, extra space on a
 path provides a means of easy navigation from which all users may
 benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 Furthermore, inclusive behaviours leverage the uniqueness of different
 viewpoints and experiences to provide a form of awareness on behalf
 of learners of all abilities. As an educational platform, virtual
 environments offer a synchronous, engaging vehicle to cultivate
 empathy, thus depreciating the concept that people with disabilities are
 societal outsiders.
