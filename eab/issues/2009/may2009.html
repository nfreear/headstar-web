<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i113-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Analyst Urges New Approach To Technology Inclusion.</h3>
<p> 
 Technology designers should move away from providing add-on
 'accessibility' tools for people with disabilities towards designing with
 all users in mind from the outset, technology broadcaster and analyst
 Bill Thompson told delegates at Headstar's E-Access '09 conference (
 <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess09">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess09</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Instead of thinking about accessibility as a separate design aspect,
 designers should consider the concept of 'affordance', defined as what
 a technology can allow all users to do, whatever their abilities,
 Thompson said in his keynote address.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;After all, technology is there to mediate between us and the world,
 and all technology is about changing, enhancing or correcting our bare
 capabilities to allow new things to be possible.How many of you can
 see the moons of Jupiter with your naked eye, or run at 80 miles an
 hour? The additive power of technology is as true of the telescope and
 the car as it is of the internet.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 A focus on 'affordance' would lead to a more flexible approach that
 would help everyone bridge skills gaps, he said. &quot;Affordances matter
 equally to the 'abled' as to the 'disabled', and so the same design
 methods can be used, and outcomes can be evaluated in a much
 broader way. This allows us to start to move away from the current
 model, in which we have 'assistive' technologies to overcome
 'deficits' that make some users 'abnormal', to one in which we all have
 skills and abilities that vary along a large number of axes.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Moving technology companies towards such a change in approach
 might require incentives, Thompson said, but these need not be
 negative, such as imposing a tax on failure. Instead, &quot;We could nudge
 them to do the right thing by offering benefits and tax breaks for those
 whose choices are more in line with this point of view, perhaps
 limiting access to government support services, guaranteed bank loans
 and the other benefits that businesses are currently calling for to those
 who will offer tools, sites and services that can be used by all taxpayers
 and not just those with 20/20 vision and high levels of manual
 dexterity&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, everyone would gain, Thomson said. &quot;We've taken the
 easy path so far, but I would speculate that interfaces designed for all
 will not only be more usable by mainstream adopters, they will be
 more powerful. And they will unleash a wave of creativity not only
 from those of us who are already well served but from the millions
 upon millions who are currently excluded.&quot;

<h3 id="i113-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessibility 'Not Fringe Issue' For It Purchasing.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility to people with disabilities should be a primary factor
 driving IT purchasing decisions within the public sector, a leading
 expert in the field told Headstar's e-Access 09 conference. Sean Smith,
 who leads on accessibility policy within HM Revenue &amp; Customs
 (HMRC), told delegates: &quot;Disability is not just a fringe issue. What we
 have now is going to be here for many years to come, so we've got to
 work hard at making sure that what we buy is accessible.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In a large organisation with thousands of staff and providing hundreds
 of online services, it is far cheaper to ensure systems are accessible at
 the outset than to make changes later, Smith said. &quot;Cost is an
 increasingly important facet. We have a large number of staff, around
 170,000 pages of content and 100-200 online services, so whenever we
 have to make a change, it's expensive and we have to make sure we get
 our priorities right.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Smith said procurement should be used as a method of bringing about
 change in the IT industry, by influencing suppliers to make their
 products more accessible. HMRC chairs the Business Taskforce on
 Accessible Technology (BTAT), an organisation formed by the
 influential body representing both public and private sector
 organisations, the Employers' Forum on Disability. &quot;We are,
 fundamentally, just a buyer of software, but within the business
 taskforce we can use our combined commercial power to influence the
 industry to make more accessible products.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 As well as compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA),
 there are genuine business and financial gains to be had from
 incorporating an accessible approach to IT, such as better retention of
 staff and more efficient service provision, Smith said. &quot;Yes of course
 we want to be DDA compliant, but there's a lot more to it than that. We
 also see, fundamentally, that there's an absolutely solid business case in
 making systems accessible and usable.&quot;

<h3 id="i113-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Call For Tougher European Access Laws.</h3>
<p> 
 A more solid European legal foundation is needed to enforce
 technology accessibility, a leading software expert from Yahoo! told
 E-Access 09.
</p>
<p> 
 Artur Ortega, 'accessibility evangelist' at Yahoo! Europe, said that
 ensuring more accessible products were developed would be a
 challenge, but that a legal basis for accessibility would actually impact
 positively on suppliers.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;At the moment, we can only preach accessibility, because there's no
 legal requirement as such. If more and more countries get a legal
 foundation for it, I think the IT industry would say - okay, it's a
 requirement, we're going to [uphold] it.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 This would ultimately improve product design and lower costs, Ortega
 said
</p>
<p> 
 Nina Warburton, director of design consultancy Alloy (
 <a href="http://www.thealloy.com/">http://www.thealloy.com/</a>
 ), urged an end to over-complicated design for everyday products such as
 mobile phones, saying all technology should be intuitive, comfortable
 and easy-to-use. Although numerous products are created with the
 intention of making life easier, for many users - including those with
 disabilities - the opposite is often the case, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Inclusive design is just good design - it's as simple as that. We need
 to make inclusive design the mainstream.&quot;

<h3 id="i113-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Foolish Moves:</h3>
<p>  Richard Morton of consultants Accessible Web Design has contributed online to our ongoing debate over whether
 publishers should be allowed to disable the text-to-speech function on
 electronic book readers (see
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Although I can see the arguments from both sides, it seems foolish for
 publishers to object to the text-to-speech facilities,&quot; Richard says.
 &quot;They may well have a legitimate case, but the negative publicity
 generated will be bad for everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;As has been pointed out, synthesised speech is not of the same quality
 as, say, Stephen Fry's voice and is unlikely to be so in the near future.
 My money is on the publishers giving in eventually, and probably
 trying to claim the moral high ground.&quot;
</p>
<h3 id="i113-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: E-Book Lament:</h3>
<p>  On a related theme, regular reader and stand-up comedian Chris McCausland writes in to lament &quot;the complete
 inaccessibility of the world of e-books.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 He writes: &quot;Despite PDF files being accessible in Adobe Reader, the
 protected PDF formats via Adobe Digital Editions are completely
 inaccessible to screen-reader users. This seems a bit silly as electronic
 text is surely the way to make hundreds of thousands of previously
 inaccessible texts accessible to blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;This inaccessibility is also something that is not advertised,
 mentioned or even alluded to on the Adobe website or any of the sites
 of the e-book retailers.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I am still in the middle of quite possibly the worst case of customer
 services I have ever experienced, from both Random House and an
 American company called ebooks.com. Despite the book I purchased
 being a Random House publication and the book being purchased
 through a link on their site to the third party retailer, Random House
 refuse to even look into the accessibility issues on their e-books and
 see if the security settings can be manipulated to allow screen-reader
 access.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;On the other hand ebooks.com seem to have the policy of putting their
 fingers in their ears and two months on from the purchase, I still don't
 even have a refund from them. It seems to be the biggest case of legal
 inaccessibility to information, next to the touch-screen. It is driving me
 insane!&quot;
</p>
<h3 id="i113-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Moodle Mission:</h3>
<p>  Rachel Ethier Rosenbaum, president of the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, Massachusetts and an &quot;avid
 reader&quot; of E-Access Bulletin, writes in seeking advice on accessible
 use of the e-learning platform Moodle, for an exciting new project.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2003, she writes, the Carroll Center began providing courses over
 the internet on how to use Microsoft's workplace applications such as
 Internet Explorer, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word for blind people using
 screen-readers and for the partially sighted using magnifiers.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Then in 2004, we discovered that the Washington State School for the
 Blind in Vancouver, Washington was also developing online courses,
 so we formed a consortium in order to avoid duplication, share ideas
 and agree on a priority list for future course development.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Rachel continues: &quot;As time went on, it became apparent that what was
 really needed was standards on accessibility and usability, so that
 programmers and web-developers would have reliable guidelines to
 create (or amend) web pages that do not inadvertently &quot;lock out&quot; the
 blind users by the nature of their designs.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;In 2006 a formal consortium was formed, now called CANnect. In
 2007 we adopted Moodle - which we initially heard about through E-
 Access Bulletin - as our learning management platform.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We are currently porting all of our existing courses over to Moodle,
 and will be using the software exclusively for future course
 development. We are now seeking other organisations or individual
 programmers who have already started tweaking Moodle to create
 more accessibility and usability for blind/visually impaired users, so
 we can learn from you and perhaps interest you in using CANnect to
 post your already-developed courses.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;If you are that person or are aware of such an organisation, please
 email our executive director, Cheryl Edmonds on

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Accessibility Versus Affordance</h3>
<p> 
 [Editor's Note: The following is an edited transcript of Bill Thompson's
 keynote speech to E-Access '09, Headstar's annual conference on
 access to
 technology by people with disabilities.]
</p>
<p> 
 Unasking The right Questions
</p>
<p> 
 By Bill Thompson.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility has always been an issue for information and
 communications technologies, but for most of the 60 or so years we've
 had stored-program digital computers, it was a secondary
 consideration.
</p>
<p> 
 Getting physical access to early computers like EDSAC and ATLAS
 involved being in the right room in the right city at the right time,
 whether or not you were a wheelchair user or had poor vision.
</p>
<p> 
 When the number of people with easy and affordable access to the new
 technologies of desktop computers, network access and online
 publishing tools was relatively small, accessibility for those who
 needed special provision could be handled using one-off solutions,
 often built by those concerned since they were technical themselves.
</p>
<p> 
 Over the years this has led us to design systems for the majority and
 then adapt them to work for those who are somehow different, and we
 keep thinking about 'accessibility' and 'usability' as separate, almost
 orthogonal aspects of design. Unfortunately, this remains the dominant
 model, and it has now become a barrier to future progress because it
 encourages designers to think about creating tools and services for the
 'normal' population before considering accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 We need to change this approach, and to move away from solving the
 'problem' of accessibility to a view of design in which it stops meriting
 separate consideration.
</p>
<p> 
 We need to stop giving designers the opportunity to talk about
 'accessibility', and instead collapse the distinction that is causing us so
 much trouble.
</p>
<p> 
 Instead of thinking about 'access' at one end and 'usability' at another,
 we should attempt to recast our debate in terms of what technology
 does for all of us, not just those whose have 'special' requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 After all, technology is there to mediate between us and the world, and
 all technology is about changing, enhancing or correcting our bare
 capabilities to allow new things to be possible, transforming the
 otherwise inaccessible and unperceivable into sense data, or subjecting
 the physical world to the influence of enhanced motor skills.
</p>
<p> 
 How many of you can see the moons of Jupiter with your naked eye, or
 run at
 80-miles-an-hour?
</p>
<p> 
 The additive power of technology is as true of the telescope and the car
 as it is of the internet. Technologies sit between us and the world and
 allow us to perceive it more intimately, measure it more precisely,
 influence it with greater precision and scope, and reach out to others
 without concern for distance or - in many cases - language.
</p>
<p> 
 They do that for us all, irrespective of our capabilities. But different
 technologies offer different affordances, depending on where we
 encounter them and - most importantly - our own capabilities. We can
 only use a telescope to see the craters of the moon if we have adequate
 vision, though of course interpreting the data from a radio telescope
 does not necessarily require this.
</p>
<p> 
 We have too often been content to build technologies which only serve
 to enhance the capabilities of the 'modally-abled', those whose
 physical and cognitive abilities cluster around the modal value for
 modern humans. We clearly disregard those whose abilities are much
 lower than the norm, but also tend to forget those who may be better -
 they tend to cope, of course, and do not usually ask for special
 attention.
</p>
<p> 
 So how should we frame our debate if we move beyond what I think is
 a dangerous attempt to retain the distinction between 'usability' and
 'accessibility'? I think it is time to explore the idea of 'affordance', as
 it could offer us a way forward.
</p>
<p> 
 Bill Gaver, Professor of Design at Goldsmiths College, has an
 interesting take on this. In a 1996 paper, he wrote: &quot;Affordances go
 beyond value-free physical descriptions of the environment by
 expressing environmental attributes relative to humans. For example,
 the physical measure of height, which has no inherent meaning, can be
 recast in terms of the affordance of accessibility, which does. Because
 accessibility emerges from the relation between elevation and people's
 physical characteristics, it is an objective fact about a situation.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The idea of accessibility - here used to mean whether a shelf or
 window can be reached - as something which emerges from a
 relationship between a technology and a user is one we might build on
 in our attempt to reconcile the usability-driven design approach and
 our concern over whether people can use specific technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 The key is the interaction between the technology and what it offers
 and the ability of the user actually to make use of that offer, as it
 allows us to sketch out a model of augmented capability that covers all
 of us, not just those who might be classified as 'disabled' in some way.
</p>
<p> 
 If we start to frame the issues facing users whose capabilities deviate
 from the norm in terms of affordances rather than simply of
 accessibility, this might free us from the 'modal totalitarianism' that
 infects so much design, whether in products like screens and keyboards
 or on-screen in websites, widgets and services.
</p>
<p> 
 Affordances matter equally to the 'abled' as to the 'disabled', and so
 the same design methods can be used, and outcomes can be evaluated
 in a much broader way. This allows us to start to move away from the
 current model, in which we have 'assistive' technologies to overcome
 'deficits' that make some users 'abnormal', to one in which we all have
 skills and abilities that vary along a large number of axes.
</p>
<p> 
 This is going to be very important in the near future, as those of us who
 first encountered digital technologies when we were young and able-
 bodied, begin to age. I wear glasses to read from the screen, and I
 know that my high-frequency hearing has been damaged by years of
 gigs and loud music in headphones.
</p>
<p> 
 I can feel my cognitive abilities going, and can see a world where I will
 be, as Shakespeare might have put it, sans eyes, sans teeth, sans
 keyboard, and in the near future I will need assistive technologies even
 more.
</p>
<p> 
 If we think differently about design and consider issues of accessibility
 in terms of affordances, then we may move closer to another goal -
 that of exposing and understanding the impacts of the negative
 'externalities' of unusable sites and services.
</p>
<p> 
 To an economist, externalities are effects on parties that are not
 directly involved in a transaction, such as the impact of a polluting
 factory on the health of non-employees in the surrounding area. The
 costs of the transaction do not therefore reflect its full costs or
 benefits,
 once these externalities are taken into account. Externalities can be
 positive, such as the network effect that comes from more and more
 people using an online service, or negative.
</p>
<p> 
 By and large, businesses will try to bring more of the positive
 externalities in-house - we might see battles over copyright as an
 attempt by rights-holders to internalise all the benefits of creative reuse
 - but keep negative externalities away, and off their balance sheet.
</p>
<p> 
 A more integrated approach to design, however, one that classes all
 users as equal and equally deserving of service, could make it harder
 for those who disregard the needs of the non-modal population to treat
 the costs as an externality to be met by extra funding, charitable
 engagement or personal expenditure on assistive technology. And by
 bringing the costs back to those who have given us this world of
 dysfunctional technology, we might persuade even the accountants and
 management consultants who have for so long disregarded the needs of
 anyone outside the mainstream, that there are sound financial reasons
 for becoming more inclusive.
</p>
<p> 
 We would not even need to tax them to achieve this (though this would
 be one approach): we could nudge them to do the right thing by
 offering benefits and tax breaks for those whose choices are more in
 line with this point of view, perhaps limiting access to government
 support services, guaranteed bank loans and the other benefits that
 businesses are currently calling for, to those who will offer tools, sites
 and services that can be used by all taxpayers and not just those with
 20/20 vision and high levels of manual dexterity.
</p>
<p> 
 The transition from the current approach, which we could call modal
 oligarchy, to one of design for all, will not be easy. Those of us within
 one standard deviation of the mean may worry that elegant tools and
 desirable products that 'just work' will no longer be available, that
 innovation will be limited and that we will have to work harder to get
 what we want from websites.
</p>
<p> 
 But no user interface is intuitive, no keyboard obvious, no website
 'natural'. Just as learning language rewires the human brain, so
 learning how to use network computers requires us to link old skills in
 new ways. We've taken the easy path so far, but I would speculate that
 interfaces designed for all will not only be more usable by mainstream
 adopters, they will be more powerful.
</p>
<p> 
 And they will unleash a wave of creativity not only from those of us
 who are already well served but from the millions upon millions who
 are currently excluded.
</p>
<p> 
 If we believe in the transforming power of these new technologies, if
 we want the network revolution to succeed, and if we desire the best
 and brightest to join us in this brave new world, then we need to ensure
 that the barriers to access are removed at all levels. That means
 campaigning to bring down all of the digital divides, not just the one
 between rich and poor but between the majority of users for whom
 most technology is designed and those of us whose capabilities lie
 more than one standard deviation from the mode.
</p>
<p> 
 The conversations taking place at this conference, e-Access '09, are
 part of that process, but I think it is time to push for something more. I
 think that this should be the last e-access conference. Next year I hope
 to see you all here for e-affordance 2010.
