<h3 id="i112-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Disability Redefined As E-Learning 'Mismatch'.</h3>
<p> 
 An attempt to redefine or reframe the term 'disability', in the context
 of online learning as a mismatch between a learner's needs and the
 education process delivered, is enshrined in a new international e-
 learning standard.
</p>
<p> 
 ISO/IEC 24751:2008, 'Information technology - individualised
 adaptability and accessibility in e-learning, education and training' (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/iso3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/iso3</a>
 ) has been published by the International Organization for
 Standardisation (ISO) with the International Electrotechnical
 Commission (IEC).
</p>
<p> 
 The standard says it views disability as &quot;a consequence of a mismatch
 between the learner's needs (or preferences) and the education or
 learning experience delivered.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;For example, an individual who is blind is not disabled when the
 lesson is delivered in audio. However, an individual who does not have
 the necessary background knowledge to understand the lesson, or who
 is listening to the lesson in a noisy environment, is disabled.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Thus, the needs and preferences of a user may arise from the user's
 context or environment, the technical requirements of the user's device,
 the tools available (e.g. assistive technologies such as Braille devices,
 voice recognition systems, alternative keyboards, etc.), the user's
 background, or a disability in the traditional sense.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Given this reframing of the meaning of &quot;disability&quot;, a learning
 environment is deemed as &quot;accessible&quot; when learner needs can be
 addressed or matched.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The new standard is published in three parts. Part 1 offers a framework
 and reference model to describe and specify learner needs and
 preferences and the corresponding description of the digital learning
 resources. Part 2 sets out &quot;access for all&quot; criteria on personal needs and
 preferences, including how they can be ranked by priority. Finally, Part
 3 provides a 'digital resource description', a common language for
 describing aspects of a computer system to facilitate their being
 matched to learners' needs and preferences.
</p>
<p> 
 The standard or individual parts are available at a charge from ISO
 national member institutes such as the British Standards Institution, or
 from the ISO Central Secretariat.

<h3 id="i112-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Concerns Raised Over Australian Mobile News Service.</h3>
<p> 
 The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has failed to
 adequately address accessibility problems with its new mobile web
 news service, one of the country's leading accessibility analysts has
 told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Tom Worthington, a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer
 Science at the Australian National University, examined 'ABC Mobile'
 (
 <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/innovation/mobile/">http://www.abc.net.au/innovation/mobile/</a>
 ) for accessibility on its launch. In a report posted to his blog, he said:
 &quot;The home page does not appear to have been designed in accordance
 with guidelines for web accessibility for the disabled, and may be
 unlawful. The site also fails several mobile phone and other web
 guidelines.&quot; One of the key faults had been with a lack of proper
 alternative text tags for information conveyed as images, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Following Worthington's initial comments, the ABC took action to
 address accessibility concerns. In a public response to Worthington's
 comments, the corporation's Chris Winter said his organisation was
 working to comply with WAI guidelines, and had updated the home
 page with alt tags integrated so text-to-speech software can now
 recognise most images for visually impaired people.
</p>
<p> 
 Worthington's original comments and the ABC response can be read
 on his blog at:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/abc3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/abc3</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 However, Worthington has now told E-Access Bulletin the changes do
 not go far enough.
 &quot;If anything, the web site appears to be less compliant than it was
 when first released,&quot; he said. &quot;Senior management need to make sure
 they get advice from competent staff. The ABC has competent web
 designers, as shown by their main web site. But these staff do not
 appear to have been consulted on the mobile web site.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Much of the academic's concern centres around the potential of mobile
 news services to act as early warning systems in major emergencies,
 such as the recent Australian bushfires. But in a recent talk on the
 subject Worthington warned that if services were not accessible they
 could not act as effective emergency warnings:

<h3 id="i112-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Finnish Trial For Touch-Screen Braille On Mobiles.</h3>
<p> 
 A method for presenting Braille characters as a sequence of strong and
 weak pulses on the touch-screen of a mobile device has been
 developed by a research team at the University of Tampere in Finland.
</p>
<p> 
 The most successful method tested by the team involved sending
 sequences of pulses about a third of a second apart to a single point of
 the screen of a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet. Almost all participants could
 accurately recognise individual characters sent in this way, though
 faster speeds reduced the recognition rate.
</p>
<p> 
 Further studies are needed to evaluate how well people can recognise a
 series of multiple characters forming words, the team says. The full
 research paper is available from the international technology standards
 and research organisation IEEE at a cost of 29 US Dollars:

<h3 id="i112-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Discrimination Complaint:</h3>
<p>  In a comment left on our website on last issue's article 'Row Brewing Over E-Book Speech Function
 Removal' (
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ), reader Dave Garside raises some questions about the apparent inequity
 behind a refusal to allow text-to-speech automation for electronic
 books.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;When a paper book is purchased a royalty is paid and it is not an issue
 whether the book is read by sight, a second person out loud or by
 mechanical means,&quot; he says. &quot;With an e-book the royalty has also been
 paid.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Are the objections because those who prefer an audio copy are being
 ripped off by paying a higher royalty fee? Or is it not a royalty but a
 profit issue?
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Either way, it forces the blind to pay extra for a service that could be
 supplied at the same price as to a sighted customer, and that is a
 discrimination issue.&quot;

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special ReportWeb Accessibility Statements.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: The Best Of Intentions, Clearly Stated.</h3>
<p> 
 Just 10 per cent of accessibility statements on local government
 websites are 'excellent', with a further 37 per cent deemed
 'satisfactory', according to new research from the Society of IT
 Management (Socitm
 <a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk">http://www.socitm.gov.uk</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The research is published this week as a special supplement to Better
 Connected 2009, the society's annual snapshot review of all UK
 council websites.
</p>
<p> 
 The accessibility statement is seen as central to having a website that is
 accessible to all users, including people with disabilities, the report
 says. However, despite the low level of excellent practice found, local
 authority sites fare well when compared with the private sector, it says.
 No private sector statements were found to be excellent, and just 16 per
 cent were satisfactory.
</p>
<p> 
 A much higher percentage of local authority websites (79 per cent)
 have a link on their home page to an accessibility statement than
 private sector websites (44 per cent). On a number of other points
 about facilities on the home page (such as changing text size), local
 authorities are significantly better than the private sector, Socitm says.
</p>
<p> 
 Taken together, the results of the survey show that local government
 has a much stronger awareness of accessibility policy and
 implementation than the private sector, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 Central Office of Information guidance states that website accessibility
 statements should contain four features, the report says.
</p>
<p> 
 The first feature is a clear statement that demonstrates the
 organisation's commitment to web accessibility. The percentage of
 sites that show this commitment from those that have accessibility
 statements is very high, the new report finds, and more or less the same
 across the two sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 The second feature is information about any areas of the website that
 do not yet conform with the overall accessibility targets of the website.
 Here, the percentage is low in both cases, at no more than 10 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 The third feature concerns contact details for people wishing to report
 problems with the website. On this feature there is some differentiation
 between the two sectors with local government (60%) much more
 likely than the private sector (43%) to provide contact information.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, Socitm tested for a link to an accessibility policy. Just four
 councils and no private sector website tested featured such a link.
</p>
<p> 
 The researchers then looked at other types of accessibility practice,
 starting with ways of making the site more flexible to use by people
 with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Local authority websites are much more flexible (71 per cent) than
 private sector websites (25 per cent) in offering an option to change
 text size on web pages. Many organisations provide information for
 visitors on how to change text size in their browser. However, many
 also made it easier by offering links from the home page which
 increase text size. Some provided both options.
</p>
<p> 
 Similarly, local authority websites are more flexible (41 per cent) than
 private sector websites (11 per cent) in offering an option to change
 colour contrast, but in both cases this option is less common than
 changing text size. A 'Yes' answer counted if there was information on
 how to change colours, or if there was a link to an external site such as
 'MyWebMyWay' in context.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, the Socitm research recommends that an accessibility
 statement should be central to an organisation's commitment to an
 accessible website. It is no surprise that having an accessibility
 statement increases the likelihood of having an accessible website (by
