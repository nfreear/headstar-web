<h3 id="i111-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Row Brewing Over E-Book Speech Function Removal.</h3>
<p> 
 A row has erupted over whether or not publishers should be allowed to
 disable the text-to-speech function on electronic book readers, after
 one US reader manufacturer bowed to requests from an authors' rights
 group and made the speech function optional.
</p>
<p> 
 Manufacturer Amazon made the move with respect to its new Kindle 2
 e-book reader following representation from the Authors Guild, which
 had claimed that the automatic allowance of text-to-speech (TTS)
 conversion effectively created an audiobook device, even though no
 audio royalties were being paid.
</p>
<p> 
 Kindle 2 is marketed in the US (there are no immediate plans for a
 European release) as a 'wireless reading device', allowing users to read
 downloaded books, magazines, newspapers and blogs. Until now, all
 text downloaded to the device could also be read using the TTS
 function, but Amazon have now allowed the feature to be disabled if a
 publisher or author so wishes. Though the function is not marketed as
 an accessibility feature, and the Kindle 2 requires sight to navigate it
 effectively, blindness groups are pressing for the inclusion of TTS
 functionality by default.
</p>
<p> 
 Richard Orme, Head of Accessibility at the Royal National Institute of
 Blind People, told E-Access Bulletin this month: &quot;We want
 manufacturers to make sure that text-to-speech is available for all
 people who have a legitimate print disability. It is essential for people
 using speech readers that they can access content which hasn't been
 blocked. Synthetic speech is not the equivalent to speech by a human.
 We refute that strongly.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However a spokesperson for Amazon said: &quot;We believe that most
 authors will decide that leaving text-to-speech enabled on their titles is
 in their commercial interests, and will choose accordingly. So Kindle 2
 will still provide an innovative option for handicapped customers.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In a statement, The Authors Guild says their objection to the audio
 function is solely a royalties issue, and that they support accessible
 technology. &quot;[Some people] suggest that challenging Amazon's use of
 this software challenges accessibility to the visually impaired. It
 doesn't: Kindle 2 isn't designed for such use. The Guild continues to
 support efforts to make works truly accessible to the visually
 impaired.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Itv Unveils 'Signed Stories' Treasure-House For Deaf Children.</h3>
<p> 
 What is intended to become the world's largest online library of
 contemporary children's books fully accessible in sign language,
 sound, animation and text has been launched by the British broadcaster
 ITV, for free use by teachers, parents and carers of deaf children.
</p>
<p> 
 Signed Stories (
 <a href="http://www.signedstories.com">http://www.signedstories.com</a>
) has been created by ITV SignPost, the company's non-profit
 accessibility agency. Around 25 stories are already available to view in
 British Sign Language by streaming video alongside the other
 complementary formats, with a plan to offer 150 stories by the end of
 the year, and 300 or more by the end of 2010.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the site's creators, every major publisher approached has
 agreed to hand over rights to use their books in this way, with those
 signed up to date including Macmillan, Penguin, Hachette Children's
 Books and Walker Books.
</p>
<p> 
 Eileen Young, Manager of ITV SignPost, told E-Access Bulletin her
 team now wants the site to grow and eventually to become more
 interactive, with possible future features including book reviews by
 children; forums for deaf kids; and the ability for teenagers to
 communicate with each other by signing using webcams.
</p>
<p> 
 Malcolm Wright, Managing Director of ITV SignPost, said the
 initiative was born from a sense of deep frustration at a widening
 inequality between deaf children and hearing children in an area -
 reading stories - that might seem as if it presented no barrier for the
 deaf.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The attainment gap was getting wider, and I was astonished that in a
 caring, first world country this could be happening,&quot; Wright said. An
 important subsidiary function of the website is its ability to provide
 other information to those working with deaf kids, he said. &quot;The back
 end of the site contains a lot of advice and resources for deaf parents,
 parents with deaf children and teachers of deaf children.&quot;

<h3 id="i111-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Private Sector Slow To Address Access Queries.</h3>
<p> 
 A 'mystery shopper' test which sent emails to a range of UK local
 council and private sector websites requesting information on their
 accessibility to blind users has uncovered a pattern of poor responses,
 with around one in five sites not bothering to respond at all.
</p>
<p> 
 The exercise, carried out by the local government Society of IT
 Management as part of its annual 'Better Connected' review of council
 websites (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6</a>
 ), found local government websites performed better than sites in other
 sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 The test featured an anonymous email claiming to be from a blind
 person who was having difficulty using the website, with a request for
 help in accessing services. The same message was sent to all UK
 councils, plus a sample of 20 household name companies from the
 finance, travel and retail sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 52% in local government sent back a satisfactory response,
 compared with just 27% of websites from other sectors. Additionally,
 in 13% of cases with websites from other sectors, an email address
 could not even be found, while there were no instances of this with
 local government sites. However, local government did perform
 marginally worse or similar to the public sector in some regards: some
 20% of council sites failed to reply at all, compared with 18% from
 other sectors, and 43% of the other websites contacted sent a reply
 within two days, compared to 42% of council sites.
</p>
<p> 
 The report claims that &quot;Generally, the differences in the quality of
 replies imply a lower level of awareness of website accessibility in
 other sectors,&quot; although the large difference in sample sizes between
 the two sectors (around 500 compared with just 20) should be taken
 into account.
</p>
<p> 
 Elsewhere in the Socitm report, general accessibility testing found a
 picture of low compliance with international standards, and little
 improvement on accessibility levels found a year previously. For a full
 report see Section Four, this issue.

 sighted people, and it is becoming more and more difficult accessing
 technology, especially when it is upgraded. The [NHS] website,
 electronic patient records and more recently the email website is just
 simply inaccessible for visually impaired people. [They] have limited
 function, and appear to have been designed without disabled people
 being considered. Simple features like being able to use the scroll
 facility on the mouse simply do not work.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: News Analysis- Signed Stories.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: The Music Of Signsby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 At last month's launch of Signed Stories (
 <a href="http://www.signedstories.com">http://www.signedstories.com</a>
 ), an online treasure-house of children's stories in British Sign Language
 created by broadcaster ITV for free use by teachers, parents and carers
 of deaf children, the excitement was palpable.
</p>
<p> 
 G. P. Taylor, author of the best-selling 'Shadowmancer' series of
 children's books, said the service was &quot;the most exciting thing to
 happen in children's reading since the invention of the book.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 With first-hand experience of the communication and attainment gap
 faced by deaf people, as the child of deaf parents, Taylor said the site
 &quot;hit on something all kids are in love with - the internet,&quot; and would
 have enormous benefits for all involved.
</p>
<p> 
 The creators of Signed Stories, the non-profit accessibility agency
 within ITV known as SignPost, hope it will grow into the largest
 online library of contemporary children's books fully accessible in sign
 language, sound, animation and text.
</p>
<p> 
 Around 25 stories are already available, with a plan to offer 150 by the
 end of the year, and 300 or more by the end of 2010.
</p>
<p> 
 ITV is contributing funds, staff - including signers - and technical
 facilities to the project, but the broadcaster is also looking for
 sponsorship for individual stories, which cost around Â&pound;5,000 each to
 produce. The service will remain non-profit however, and will never
 carry advertising.
</p>
<p> 
 Book publishers have been invited to contribute the rights for use of
 their books on the service free of charge, and have responded
 positively. Around a dozen major publishers have already signed up
 including Macmillan, Penguin, Hachette Children's Books and Walker
 Books, and the service has also gained support from charities and other
 organisations including the National Literacy Trust and the National
 Deaf Children's Society.
</p>
<p> 
 Eileen Young, Manager of ITV SignPost, told E-Access Bulletin that
 &quot;All major publishers we've approached have agreed to sign over
 rights, though some are still working on the paperwork.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Young said her team now wants the site to grow and eventually to
 become more interactive, with possible future features including book
 reviews by children; forums for deaf kids; and the ability for teenagers
 to communicate with each other by signing using webcams.
</p>
<p> 
 Technically the service does not demand a high specification of
 computer to receive the video streams, Young said: although the files
 cannot be downloaded for copyright reasons, they are streamed at four
 different rates and the service will automatically optimise to suit the
 computer used to access it.
</p>
<p> 
 Although there are problems to overcome with some schools - one
 SignPost technician told E-Access Bulletin that getting around the
 blocking of the service by the firewalls used by some schools was a
 &quot;major challenge&quot; - the early feedback from those schools that are
 using it is that they love it, Young said.
</p>
<p> 
 It is easy to see why: as well as being free, the service is valuable,
 imaginative, creative and fun to use. Story categories include
 'fairytales and folktales', 'families and friendships' and 'slimy scary',
 and within each zone a 'story tree' with different coloured interactive
 branches helps guide users through books by level of reading
 difficulty.
</p>
<p> 
 The service has emerged from the combination of a few strands of
 work by ITV SignPost over the past few years. ITV already runs an
 online news service for deaf people in BSL. And the children's stories
 project was first considered as a TV format, with a series of 'sign a
 story' programmes mooted for broadcast over ordinary channels.
</p>
<p> 
 Within the emergence of the internet, however, online seemed the
 logical home for it, allowing greater flexibility, interactivity and ease
 of access.
</p>
<p> 
 Malcolm Wright, Managing Director of ITV SignPost, said the
 initiative was born from a sense of deep frustration at a widening
 inequality between deaf children and hearing children in an area -
 reading stories - that might seem as if it presented no barrier for the
 deaf.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The attainment gap was getting wider, and I was astonished that in a
 caring, first world country this could be happening,&quot; Wright told the
 launch. &quot;It was clear that the biggest problem was one of literacy in
 English - deaf children just don't read stories that much. So I went out
 and bought the domain signedstories.com, and then wondered what on
 Earth I was going to do with it.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 What Wright eventually did was to assemble an eclectic and stellar
 supporting cast of publishers, story-tellers and celebrities - stars
 backing the project range from Children's Laureate Michael Rosen to
 Dame Helen Mirren, Robbie Coltrane, Zoe Wanamaker and Sir Trevor
 McDonald.
</p>
<p> 
 He said the site, which had its soft launch on 15 December last year, is
 &quot;Fantastically well-watched already by thousands of kids in schools,&quot;
 and that &quot;by the end of 2011 I hope that Signed Stories will be a
 repository of the best of children's literature not just for deaf children
 but for all children.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 An important subsidiary function of the website is its ability to provide
 other information to those working with deaf kids, Wright said. &quot;The
 back end of the site contains a lot of advice and resources for deaf
 parents, parents with deaf children and teachers of deaf children.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Asif Iqbal, Founder of Deaf Parenting UK
 ( <a href="http://www.deafparent.org.uk/">http://www.deafparent.org.uk/</a>
 ), told the launch that some 90% of deaf and hard of hearing parents have
 hearing children, a situation which presents further barriers and

 The new service &quot;enables deaf parents to sit with their children, a
 fantastic opportunity where all family members can access the stories
 without barriers,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p> 
 David Lloyd, chairman of Walker Books
 ( <a href="http://www.walker.co.uk">http://www.walker.co.uk</a>
 ), said the possibilities of story-telling through signs were about more
 than just access to words, but had their own magic, and sense of
 theatre, that was compelling for hearing as well as deaf readers. &quot;It
 turns the music of words into the physical music of signs. It's a
 wonderful way to tell a story,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;What an extraordinary medium it is - the internet - with such power
 to include us all,&quot; said Walker. &quot;But don't forget the book itself - made
 out of trees and vegetable juices of all kinds and full of surprises, and it
 lasts - but then I would say that, wouldn't I - I'm a publisher.&quot;

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Focus- Council Website Accessibility.
</h2>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: DÃ©JÃ  Vu All Over Again?By Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 Readers of the eleventh annual Better Connected report on UK council
 websites, published last month by the local government Society of
 Information Technology Management (Socitm), might be forgiven for
 feeling that time has stood still.
</p>
<p> 
 Last year's report found that only 37 out of 464 council websites (8%)
 attained the most basic level of accessibility, Level 'A' of the World
 Wide Web consortium's (W3C) web content accessibility guidelines
 (WCAG 1.0) (
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=164">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=164</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 But Better Connected 2009 shows that little, if anything, has been done
 to address the problem. Almost exactly the same  number of councils
 surveyed (36) achieved a Level A rating, and for the second year
 running, none have achieved Level AA or Level AAA - the highest
 rating possible (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/so6</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 This paints a gloomy picture, especially considering that all public
 sector websites have been advised to meet a minimum accessibility
 standard of Level AA by December 2009 in 'Delivering inclusive
 websites', a 2008 publication from the Central Office of Information.
 In fact, the original consultation process for 'Delivering inclusive
 websites' in 2007 had suggested that government sites should have
 their rights to use the '.gov.uk' web domain withdrawn unless they met
 Level AA by December 2008, a recommendation which, luckily for the
 public sector, was eventually watered down.
</p>
<p> 
 It is not all bad news this year, however. Some encouragement can be
 drawn from the implementation of a new additional qualitative
 assessment system, carried out for Socitm by the Royal National
 Institute for the Blind (RNIB), and designed to give an overall picture
 of council website accessibility. The system used its own 0-3 rating,
 with 0 representing a frequent absence of accessibility and 3
 representing a site that was functionally fully accessible. Under this
 system, 136 councils (33%) were rated by the RNIB as satisfactory or
 excellent; a far more encouraging statistic than the 8% who achieved
 WCAG Level A.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin following the publication of this year's
 report, Socitm Insight Programme Manager Martin Greenwood said
 the 2009 survey did not present a negative picture of council website
 accessibility but said further advances should now be made. &quot;In terms
 of a strategic improvement, councils must make a commitment to
 accessibility. Specifically, they must ensure that any new software
 purchased is not inaccessible. There were some bad decisions made
 four or five years ago regarding software procurement.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Greenwood also said councils can take rapid and effective action by
 addressing a list of five common accessibility errors identified in the
 report. As with Better Connected 2008, these errors accounted for a
 large proportion (76%) of failures to meet the Level A guideline, he
 said. The common errors were the presence of images without
 alternative text; inappropriate use of JavaScript; simple data table
 errors; complex data table errors; and a lack of accessible alternatives
 to website features.
</p>
<p> 
 Greenwood also said that there was &quot;no chance at all&quot; of all public
 sector websites achieving a Level AA rating by December 2009, as set
 out in 'Delivering inclusive websites', but said that in any case this
 target may now be superceded by the introduction of the revised
 WCAG 2.0 guidelines from W3C in December 2008, while work on
 Better Connected was ongoing.
</p>
<p> 
 The introduction of WCAG 2.0 represented a significant step forward,
 Greenwood said, allowing for clearer guidelines and an approach that
 is &quot;more flexible in dealing with issues such as the impact of new
 technology.&quot; However, websites that failed to achieve a Level A
 accessibility rating under WCAG 1.0 will be unable to use the
 'outdated' status of the older system as a get-out clause. The Socitm
 report states: &quot;Most websites that conform with WCAG 1.0 should not
 require significant changes in order to conform with WCAG 2.0. Just
 as importantly, for those that do not conform with WCAG 1.0, the task
 is not likely to be much easier under WCAG 2.0.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB was also largely positive about the report's findings,
 claiming that the figures do not necessarily represent a widespread lack
 of accessibility. &quot;In fact, we noticed a significant improvement in the
 real accessibility of most of the websites we assessed. Unfortunately
 that doesn't always show in a strict conformance check,&quot; said Bim
 Egan, Senior Web Access Consultant at the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 Egan said there were also extraneous factors which contributed to
 some of the websites failing to meet the guidelines: &quot;Third party
 content has a big part to play in the use of technologies that failed the
 previous guidelines [WCAG 1.0]. We had to fail 263 sites for using
 JavaScript, for instance, [but] in the majority of cases this was due to
 providing benefits calculators and online payment services.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Better Connected 2009 also makes a series of accessibility
 recommendations for councils to improve their sites, including
 securing a commitment to accessible websites; building accessibility
 into procurement criteria; supporting a programme of user education;
 and carrying out user testing with groups of disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Councils can also draw encouragement from the feeling that they are
 not alone in the struggle to become accessible online. According to a
 separate Socitm study due to be published in full in April, local
 government outperforms various other sectors in terms of website
 accessibility, including FTSE 100 companies, finance companies and
 the travel industry.
</p>
<p> 
 The opportunity is now here for the public sector to take the lead as it
 works towards implementing WCAG 2.0.
