<h3 id="i118-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Ec Proposes Law To Address 'Fragmented' Accessibility Rules.</h3>
<p> 
 A 'European Disability Act' has been proposed by the European
 Commission to standardise guidelines on web accessibility for disabled
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 In a speech in Brussels earlier this month, Viviane Reding -
 commissioner for information society and media - said approaches
 need to be harmonised throughout Europe. &quot;We cannot achieve the
 single market by leaving aside certain parts of our population&quot;, said
 Reding. &quot;I am talking about e-accessibility: 15% of our population is
 disabled, and our rules on accessibility are still fragmented.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Reding also urged Europe-wide adoption of the international Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines created by the World Wide Web
 Consortium standards body (WCAG:
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/</a>
 ), saying a new disability law is the most effective way of achieving this. &quot;We should do it together and in
 step so that . users get a decent and reliable framework. I believe the
 way we should do this is to develop together with stakeholders a
 European Disability Act&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 In her speech - entitled 'The Digital Single Market: a key to unlock the
 potential of the knowledge based economy' (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/A6JHv">http://bit.ly/A6JHv</a>
 ) - Reding said the current fragmentation of accessibility laws is leading
 to EU member states approaching the subject from different directions,
 damaging the effectiveness of current legislation: &quot;We have to consider
 that this is costly for industry because they have to respond to a wide
 range of fragmented national standards. It also leaves disabled people
 without a consistent level of service that they can expect&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently, the UK Disability Discrimination Act requires UK websites
 to be accessible for those with disabilities, including visual and hearing
 impairments, though there are no specific guidelines in the act itself as
 to what this constitutes.

<h3 id="i118-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Access Information Absent From Tv Set Maker Websites.</h3>
<p> 
 One of the UK's leading experts on accessible technology has called
 for TV set manufacturers to provide better information on their
 websites about access to their products by people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Adrian Higginbotham, manager of cutting edge research at the UK's
 education technology agency Becta, made the comments after his own
 attempts to buy an accessible TV set which supported audio
 description (AD) were hampered repeatedly by poor information
 online.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin this month in a personal capacity, he
 said the best source of information he had found had been
 announcements on the independent 'TV Help' guidance website (
 <a href="http://www.tvhelp.org.uk/audes/">http://www.tvhelp.org.uk/audes/</a>
 ) that all new Panasonic models; nearly 40 Sony sets; six Toshiba sets and a few sets from Philips would
 be audio description-ready. But when he had looked for accessibility
 information on the websites of the manufacturers themselves, there had
 been almost nothing of use.
</p>
<p> 
 On the Panasonic website, there had been no relevant information at
 all, even though &quot;It didn't seem like the sort of thing they would leave
 out, given the level of technical detail they went into,&quot; Higginbotham
 said. The Sony website mentioned audio description features in an
 online glossary of terms, but not on most model descriptions.
</p>
<p> 
 Following an online query from Higginbotham earlier as to which
 current models supported AD, Sony UK's Customer Information
 Centre replied: &quot;No details of the products due for launch in the future
 or their specifications are made available or published prior to their
 launch. I regret therefore that I am unable to provide you with any
 information at this time.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Higginbotham next pointed out his question was not about future
 models but currently available products, and asked: &quot;Is your rather
 vague message of earlier today trying to tell me that Sony has taken a
 strategic decision to backtrack on the support which it has previously
 offered to visually impaired customers?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 This led to a second reply which was &quot;the complete opposite&quot; of the
 first, stating
 all current models did in fact support AD. While this did indeed turn
 out to be the case, Higginbotham said, &quot;I didn't in the end buy a Sony,
 or even look at many of their models because the whole experience of
 dealing with the customer centre didn't particularly make me feel like
 giving them the benefit of my business.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Manufacturers that make their sets accessible are to be commended, he
 said, but unless they make the information available there is not much
 point. &quot;I wouldn't expect all customer support staff to know about it or
 staff in high street shops, but it should be on their own website.&quot;

<h3 id="i118-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Ict Data Gap 'Hindering Disabled Business Owners'.</h3>
<p> 
 A lack of reliable data about the use of ICT by people with disabilities
 is making it harder for disabled entrepreneurs to succeed, delegates
 heard at a recent debate hosted by the Information Technologists'
 Company, a livery company of the City of London.
</p>
<p> 
 The debate was on the motion: &quot;This House believes that it is harder
 for disabled entrepreneurs to compete in the fast-moving digital age&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Nick Goss, managing director of Goss Consultancy (
 <a href="http://www.gossconsultancy.co.uk/">http://www.gossconsultancy.co.uk/</a>
 ), said a lack of knowledge on the subject was a major barrier: &quot;How do we know how many disabled
 people are using IT, how do we know what needs and support disabled
 people may need when it comes to providing accessible IT?&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Penny Melville-Brown from Disability Dynamics (
 <a href="http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk/">http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk/</a>
 ) said inaccessible technology itself was also holding back disabled people. &quot;If the technology is not
 capable of supporting you, you are on the back foot, competitively .
 Technology at the moment has very little concept of accessibility and
 actually puts disabled entrepreneurs like me and many others in this
 country at a significant disadvantage&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 However Andrew Thomson, director of Sign-now.com ( <a href="http://sign-now.com/">http://sign-now.com/</a>
  ), said technology has &quot;enhanced quality of life&quot; for disabled
 people, and can benefit those running their own business if the right
 equipment is used. &quot;Technology has given us access to the mainstream
 world&quot;, Thomson said. In a close vote, the motion was ultimately
 defeated by 28 votes to 23.

<h3 id="i118-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Book Barriers:</h3>
<p>  A reader who wishes to remain anonymous writes in with a query about barriers to downloading accessible electronic
 books thrown up by international copyright laws.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Due to copyright laws, many DAISY books [created using the
 international DAISY standard <a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
 ] can't be purchased by individuals living outside the country in which they are
 produced,&quot; he says. &quot;For example, if RNIB produces a book in Braille
 and DAISY, they can sell me the Braille book but not the DAISY title,
 as I live outside the UK. Likewise with the US. However, I can
 purchase commercial audio books from Amazon or subscribe to
 Audible.com but can't access titles on Bookshare.org [a US service
 offering accessible books for free download for qualifying people in
 the US only].
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;A good supply of books is OverDrive [a leading online digital book
 distributor: <a href="http://www.overdrive.com">http://www.overdrive.com</a>
 ]. Unfortunately, most of the titles can only be played on players that support the protected Windows
 media format, DRM (Digital Rights Management). The issue with this
 format is that from what I understand, none of the Blindness-specific
 players support it. My Zen Stone [an audio MP3 player from Creative]
 does, but it is limited in storage and functionality.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;OverDrive also supports MP3 and iPods, but I understand there are
 fewer titles to choose from. I have made some enquiries, and
 understand that none of the blindness-specific players supports the
 DRM format due to the costs in licensing.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;So in this age of downloadable this and that, for some of us,
 especially in smaller countries, access to accessible information is still
 limited. So I guess my questions are: are there ways that one can
 purchase or download DAISY books if you don't live in the originating
 country? Is there a way to play protected file types on non-standard
 players, and if not, what can we do to convince Microsoft or the
 producers of such players to play these formats? I have asked the
 companies concerned but I got the impression that this wasn't high on
 their list for upgrading their players.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Separately, our reader would also like to know: &quot;Has any reader heard
 if anyone is working on software for playing DAISY books on the new
 iPod Nano?&quot;
</p>

<h3 id="i118-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Accountability Concern:</h3>
<p>  Concern about how far small businesses with few resources might be expected to go to make their online

<p>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Debate report- Technology and disabled entrepreneurship.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Open For Business?By Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 Few businesses in the modern world do not make use of digital
 technology. But how does this affect the half a million disabled people
 running their own businesses in the UK? This was the question posed
 earlier this month by the Information Technologists' Company (ITC)
 as they debated the motion: &quot;This House believes that it is harder for
 disabled entrepreneurs to compete in the fast-moving digital age.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking in support of the motion was Penny Melville-Brown, senior
 consultant at Disability Dynamics (
 <a href="http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk/">http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk/</a>
 ), an organisation offering equality training and consultancy. She argued that as well as poor
 access to technology, the technology itself was also holding back
 disabled people in business.
</p>
<p> 
 Citing a study from the Office for Disability Issues, Melville-Brown
 said internet use by disabled people is around 25% lower than the rest
 of the population. Additionally, she said, disabled people have
 generally lower skills than the rest of the population, with 50% of
 disabled people having no qualifications at all, meaning that IT skills
 will also be lower. &quot;There is very little . . . accessible training and
 accessible learning around IT&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Data from the Office for National Statistics indicates that disabled
 people are more likely to be self-employed than non-disabled people,
 but this statistic reveals only half the picture, she said. Although
 starting one's own business offers various benefits such as flexible and
 home working, and easier use of personal accessibility equipment,
 disabled people are often forced into this position because of
 difficulties in gaining or retaining employment in other areas, said
 Melville-Brown.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Disabled people are really pushed towards self-employment because
 they still face such incredible discrimination when they're trying to get
 jobs,&quot; she said. It is often the case that they have no other option than
 to set up for themselves because they want to work&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Even with some technology literacy, such as the ability to send emails,
 many people with disabilities remain unable to perform basic IT
 functions such as creating spreadsheets and downloading attachments,
 she said. This puts businesses run by disabled people at a huge
 disadvantage. Many businesses of today would struggle if they were
 forced to use paper invoices for all work, or had PowerPoint taken
 away from them, said Melville-Brown - problems which apply to
 many disabled business owners. &quot;There is absolutely no question that
 technology at the moment has very little concept of accessibility and
 actually puts disabled entrepreneurs like me at a significant
 disadvantage&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Opposing the motion was Andrew Thomson, Director of Sign-
 now.com ( <a href="http://sign-now.com/">http://sign-now.com/</a>
 ), a web-based translation service enabling easier communication between deaf and hearing people.
 Technology can be of huge benefit to disabled people in business, and
 is often unfairly labelled as prohibitive to employment, Thomson said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;As a disabled person, the reason I'm against [the motion] is
 technology actually cannot speak for itself&quot;, he said. &quot;Technology is
 created by man, and you can change it to meet your needs. Technology
 doesn't stop disabled people gaining employment, I think it's attitude
 that stops employment - society's attitude.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Any technology must suit the needs of the user for its potential to be
 fully exploited, and different assistive technologies will be appropriate
 for different people, Thomson said. &quot;Technology has to meet your
 needs individually. For example, the cochlear implant [providing a
 sense of sound to some deaf people] - that's technology, it's fantastic.
 It meets the needs of mainstream society and it's appropriate for people
 who acquired speech and English as their first language. But for me, I
 actually sign through videophones and interact with other deaf people.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, new technologies have enhanced quality of life for people
 with disabilities and have &quot;given us access to the mainstream world&quot;,
 said Thomson. &quot;It is a powerful tool and we should embrace it, not
 criticise it.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Ben Fletcher, a consultant at IBM, agreed, saying that given the choice
 between living as a deaf person 20 years ago and living in the present,
 he would choose the present: &quot;20 years ago there wasn't email, there
 wasn't Facebook - access at that time for me as a deaf person would
 have been much harder. I would have been at home unable to engage.
 Now I can contact clients directly and make social contact.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However, Fletcher also agreed with Melville-Brown that barriers
 remained: &quot;We need to campaign to try and change technology at the
 same time as we're using it and see how it can help us achieve what it
 is we want to achieve.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Gary Macfarlane, founder of BlueBadge Finder (
 <a href="http://www.bluebadgefinder.com/">http://www.bluebadgefinder.com/</a>
 ), a service allowing people to find nearby disabled parking and other services via their mobile device, said
 the technology industry needs help to improve. &quot;We have to try and
 assist the industry&quot;, said Macfarlane. &quot;It's not always their fault. They
 don't know why, how, or what equipment disabled people are using,
 and I think sometimes the disabled community can give feedback to
 make them more aware.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Nick Goss, managing director of Goss Consultancy (
 <a href="http://www.gossconsultancy.co.uk/">http://www.gossconsultancy.co.uk/</a>
 ), said a lack of knowledge about what kinds of accessible technology were being used was a further
 barrier for disabled people in business. &quot;How do we know how many
 disabled people are using IT, how do we know what needs and support
 disabled people may need when it comes to providing accessible IT?&quot;,
 he said.  What was needed, said Goss, was &quot;credible data&quot; about what
 kinds of IT disabled people are using and how they are using it.
</p>
<p> 
 Goss also highlighted another major obstacle for many disabled
 entrepreneurs - funding. Acquiring funding was seen as a barrier to
 running a successful business, including the government's Access to
 Work scheme ( <a href="http://bit.ly/3cUeb2">http://bit.ly/3cUeb2</a>
 ), which many criticise for being difficult to negotiate, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking from the floor, one delegate said Access to Work was fine in
 itself, but was insufficiently publicised. &quot;[The cost of accessible
 technology] is high, but the government is quite generous with its
 Access to Work funding, especially for entrepreneurs. But that's a
 best-kept secret by the government. They never publicise it&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Kevin Carey, Chair of the Royal National Institute of Blind People,
 said disabled people had &quot;benefited absolutely&quot; from information
 technology, but had also been &quot;disadvantaged comparatively&quot;, since
 despite individual successes, the gap between disabled and non-
 disabled people was increasing.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;If disabled people are going to hope to be entrepreneurs in a
 competitive global market,&quot; said Carey, &quot;we have to be much more
 careful about what markets we want to put these people into, instead of
 thinking there's some sort of global technology solution that would
 work for everybody if only the prejudice would go away and the
 engineers could do their job.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 So, after all the opinions had been advanced and exposed to heated
 discussion, what was the outcome? A vote among all those present
 revealed that technology was seen overall as more of a help than a
 hindrance, albeit narrowly, with the motion being defeated by 28 votes
 to 23.
</p>
<p> 
 Even most of those who had supported this position, however, agreed
 that further improvements can and should be made. A key message to
 emerge was that although there is much accessible technology
 available, most of it is created on a 'specialist' basis, suggesting the
 industry still refuses to accept the premise that accessible technology
 can be beneficial to all users, not just those with disabilities. The
 debate continues.
