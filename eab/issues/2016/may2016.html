<h3 id="i179-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: A Cautious Welcome As Europe Looks To Lock-In Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 A provisional agreement to make public sector websites and mobile apps
 across Europe more accessible has been reached, creating mixed reactions
 from the accessibility community.
</p>
<p> 
 The deal between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union
 and the European Commission was made earlier this month, and relates to the
 existing ‘Directive on Web Accessibility for Public Sector Websites’,
 which has been the subject of debate since its introduction in 2012 (See
 e-Access Bulletin’s previous coverage at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/b">http://eab.li/b</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 If formalised, the directive would demand that both new and existing public
 sector sites and apps be more accessible to citizens with disabilities
 across the European Union (EU). Older public sector content would also be
 made accessible when requested by citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 Carine Marzin, Chair of the European Blind Union (EBU) Campaigns Network,
 told e-Access Bulletin that the EBU welcomed this “significant
 milestone” based on the information publicly available, but warned that
 the final text of the directive is still to be released.
</p>
<p> 
 Marzin said that the EBU is also encouraged at the inclusion of mobile apps
 in the initial agreement – an issue it has been campaigning for. Another
 EU campaign focused on eliminating proposed exceptions to the directive,
 which would have meant that public sector intranet services and other
 content formats would have been excluded from accessibility regulations.
 Marzin said that “significant progress” appeared to have been made on
 some of these exceptions, again based on available information. Such
 intranet services are “very important for all disabled people in terms of
 access to education and jobs,” she said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, there is still some way to go before any enforceable web
 accessibility regulations appear. The agreement needs to be formally
 adopted by the Council and the European Parliament, and then formed into
 legislation across all EU countries. In practice, it could be several years
 before the proposed new accessibility rules are applicable; legislation
 would first be created for new websites, followed by remaining public
 sector sites, and mobile apps after that.
</p>
<p> 
 Technology access charity AbilityNet also welcomed the initial agreement,
 but called for the measures to go further than just regulating public
 sector content. Writing on the charity’s website, CEO Nigel Lewis said:
 “AbilityNet wholeheartedly welcomes this recent move … but it doesn’t
 go far enough … Policy makers are missing a trick by not including
 websites and apps in the private and third sectors. Their sheer volume
 vastly outweighs public sector websites and in our experience, they lag
 behind the public sector in accessibility terms.”

<h3 id="i179-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: The Kindle Begins To Find Its Voice With Text-To-Speech.</h3>
<p> 
 Amazon is making its Kindle e-readers more accessible for visually impaired
 users by introducing a screen-reader feature.
</p>
<p> 
 The VoiceView screen-reading function is now available on the Kindle
 Paperwhite model by plugging in the ‘Kindle Audio Adaptor’, a USB
 device designed by Amazon specifically for use with the Kindle. Users plug
 the adaptor into the Paperwhite charging jack, before plugging in
 headphones to the adaptor, and can then listen to e-books and navigate the
 Kindle interface through text-to-speech and touch-screen functionality,
 with eight adjustable reading speeds.
</p>
<p> 
 VoiceView was previously only available on Amazon’s Fire tablet devices,
 but the company has now extended it to the Paperwhite – seen as the
 ‘mid-range’ Kindle option. Currently, it’s only this one model that
 supports VoiceView, but a post on Amazon’s blog says that the feature
 “will be available in the future with other Kindle e-readers as well.”
</p>
<p> 
 The VoiceView-enabled Paperwhite Kindle is being sold in a special package,
 including the audio adaptor, for $140. This is $20 more than the standard
 Paperwhite price, but Amazon is supplying a $20 Amazon account credit with
 all purchases, to offset the extra cost.

<h3 id="i179-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Your Assistive Technology Queries Answered Online By An Expert.</h3>
<p> 
 Anyone seeking advice on assistive technology will be able to call on the
 expertise of a technology professional, thanks to a community forum on the
 website of disability charity Scope.
</p>
<p> 
 The charity’s ‘Ask an assistive technologist’ service allows users to
 leave questions on the forum, where they will be read by a specialist, who
 will then leave advice for the user to pick up. Users just need to register
 on the site to become part of Scope’s online community, and can then post
 questions.
</p>
<p> 
 Kim Lawther, an assistive technologist at Craig y Parc School in Cardiff,
 Wales, will be answering the queries. Lawther works with children and young
 adults with a range of disabilities at the Cardiff school, and has
 extensive knowledge of assistive equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 Lawther explained more about the process to e-Access Bulletin: “Scope has
 a phenomenal team of assistive technologists, so if I don’t know the
 answer to someone’s question, then I am sure one of us will. I also
 intend to point people in the direction of more information – for
 example, about suppliers or funding.”
</p>
<p> 
 The service was initially available in 2014 with a different assistive
 technologist, but after a temporary hiatus, the new appointment of Lawther
 as the community advisor has effectively relaunched the initiative.
</p>
<p> 
 So far, questions left for Lawther have covered a wide rage of topics in
 just a few weeks. Forum members have asked about: speech-recognition
 software; Google Cardboard (a newly launched virtual reality headset);
 making banking accessible for users of eye-tracking technology; games
 programming for users with learning disabilities; and a new app to help
 people with communication difficulties, AzuleJoe.

Section Three: Opinion.
- Conquering the website accessibility divide.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Realising The Dream.</h3>
<p> 
 By Donna Jodhan.
</p>
<p> 
 There is the digital divide and then there is the technology divide. Now
 I’d like to add the website accessibility divide to this list.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘website accessibility divide’ refers to those of us who are unable
 to access websites due to navigable and usability reasons, versus those who
 do not have any difficulty accessing websites.
</p>
<p> 
 The former group often describes those of us who are visually impaired, and
 for me, as one who falls into this category, I can tell you that it makes a
 huge difference in my personal life whenever I am unable to do things such
 as: access information independently and in privacy; complete forms on my
 own; request information without having to ask for sighted help; download
 and read documents without having to ask for sighted assistance; read
 content on a website on my own.
</p>
<p> 
 On a personal level, inaccessible and unusable websites have a direct
 affect on my life.  My ability to protect and maintain my confidentiality,
 independence and privacy are all affected. In short, I often have no
 alternative but to place all of this in the hands of strangers if I am
 unable to find a friend or family member that I trust to assist me.
</p>
<p> 
 For me and others like me, we are all in the same boat, so to speak. We
 cannot have access to vital information if we are unable to access websites
 independently. We cannot make vital decisions on our own behalf if we are
 unable to read information for ourselves in an independent manner.
</p>
<p> 
 For example: important information pertaining to such things as public
 safety, security, health, job and financial markets, social programs, and
 up-to-the-minute news are often beyond our reach, because of the website
 accessibility divide.
</p>
<p> 
 This is the main reason why I launched a charter challenge against the
 Canadian Government in 2006 – because their websites were inaccessible to
 me and to other blind Canadians. I could not apply for a job through their
 websites on my own, and access to vital information was horribly lacking.
</p>
<p> 
 Yes! True it is that we won a landmark victory that mandated the Canadian
 Government to make all of their websites accessible, and true it is that
 things have improved in a noticeable way, but there is still a lot of work
 to be done when it comes to this.
</p>
<p> 
 Canada does not have any sort of legislation in place that mandates and
 penalises federally regulated companies and agencies if their websites are
 not accessible to Canadians with vision impairments. As a result,
 inaccessible and unusable websites continue to be a part of the lives of
 those Canadians with vision impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 We, as visually impaired Canadians, continue to live at the whim of website
 developers who do not believe that website accessibility and usability are
 important enough for them to include in their design, and this is why I
 personally decided to take one more step.
</p>
<p> 
 In early 2015, I, along with a small group, launched Barrier Free Canada
 – Canada sans Barrières; a non-partisan grassroots organisation whose
 main objective is to lobby the Canadian Government to pass a Canadians with
 Disabilities Act. During the October 2015 Canadian election campaign, three
 parties committed to passing such legislation, including the governing
 Liberal Party lead by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
</p>
<p> 
 This new government has committed two million dollars towards this
 initiative in its most recent budget. This is good news for us! We are now
 waiting on the minister responsible for disabilities issues to commence
 public hearings, as part of the process to pass a Canadians with
 Disabilities Act. It is our cherished hope that such an act can be passed
 in time for Canada's 150th anniversary on the first day of July, 2017.
</p>
<p> 
 As it stands now, the majority of Canada’s new Parliament supports the
 passage of a Canadians with Disabilities Act, so that is one major hurdle
 that has been overcome.  Now comes the more difficult task of actually
 getting the act drafted and placed before the Canadian Parliament.
</p>
<p> 
 It is my personal dream that some day soon, all Canadians will be able to
 access websites independently, and in doing so be able to protect their
 privacy and confidentiality. This should not be a dream, because under the
 Canadian Charter of Rights, all Canadians are guaranteed equal access to
 information. Yet I can only continue to dream – for myself, for all
 Canadians who are visually impaired, but most of all, for our children of
 the future.
</p>
<p> 
 As Robert F. Kennedy, paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw, once said: “Some
 men see things as they are and say, ‘Why?’; I dream things that never
 were and say, ‘Why not?’”  Maybe I should be a bit more realistic,
 but in my heart I know that somewhere over the rainbow I will some day
 realise my dream.
</p>
<p> 
 I promised Steve Jobs to help change the world and I will keep this
 promise, because he kept his promise to us.
