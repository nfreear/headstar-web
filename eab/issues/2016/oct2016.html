<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Remembering Dan Jellinek, One Year On.This Month Marks One Year Since Dan Jellinek, E-Access Bulletin’S
Much-Loved Founder And Editor, Passed Away Unexpectedly. In That Time, A
Lot Has Changed In The Rapidly Evolving World Of Digital Accessibility, But
Our Feelings About Dan And Sense Of Loss Haven’T Changed At All.
</h3>
<p> 
 As well as Dan’s numerous personal qualities, it’s also crucial to keep
 remembering his work and his invaluable accessibility coverage over the
 years. His natural ability to find the key stories, ideas and people in the
 sector – the ones that were really making a difference – always marked
 him out as someone whose insights mattered. They continue to matter today.
</p>
<p> 
 My own experience of editing the Bulletin for the past nine months has been
 insightful, enjoyable and occasionally challenging, but always incredibly
 rewarding – not least because it’s allowed me to further understand the
 work that Dan put into it.
</p>
<p> 
 But still after one year, I find myself – all-too-frequently – wanting
 to share a news lead with Dan that I know he would find exciting, or to ask
 his opinion on an angle for a story. It still makes me immensely sad that I
 won’t be able to do either of those again, or enjoy any conversation with
 him.
</p>
<p> 
 Regular readers will also know that the relaunching of the Bulletin in
 February was only possible due to Dan’s efforts in securing a future for
 it. Without his commitment to keep it going, the Bulletin would not be
 around today.
</p>
<p> 
 Thank you for reading e-Access Bulletin and supporting the concept that Dan
 worked so passionately to uphold: ‘Access to technology for all,
 regardless of ability.’
</p>
<p> 
 Dan, you’ll always be missed, but certainly never forgotten.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Research Reveals Barriers And Solutions To Accessibility Acrossgovernment.
</h3>
<p> 
 Sifting through an “overwhelming” amount of information and
 difficulties in finding out who is tasked with accessibility are two of the
 challenges facing teams in UK Government departments when building
 accessible digital services, according to research carried out by the
 Government Digital Service (GDS).
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking in London at an event titled ‘Accessibility in the digital
 space’, Alistair Duggin, Head of Accessibility at GDS, gave delegates
 (including e-Access Bulletin) a preview of the research results. The event
 was organised by the Business Disability Forum (BDF), inviting speakers to
 discuss digital accessibility challenges for organisations and end-users,
 and the solutions available. In keeping with the theme, Duggin highlighted
 key issues that government teams were facing in this area, but also
 explained solutions and ideas to help resolve these issues – both based
 on the GDS research.
</p>
<p> 
 The aim of the research was to find out how different teams across
 government are approaching accessibility. The study involved face-to-face
 interviews with people in a range of roles across eight government
 departments, as well as analysis of existing information.
</p>
<p> 
 Findings suggested that teams often do not know who is tasked with making
 services accessible for users with disabilities. “The thought is often
 that it’s up to a developer,” said Duggin. “Developers do have a huge
 responsibility to make things accessible, but they aren’t responsible for
 content or design.”
</p>
<p> 
 Project managers need to takes on this responsibility, said Duggin:
 “[People in these roles] can’t just say, ‘Don’t worry about
 accessibility until the end, we’ll get to that bit later.’ That’s
 going to cause problems.”
</p>
<p> 
 Another issue uncovered in the research was that people become
 “overwhelmed’ by the amount of information available. “If you search
 for accessibility on the internet, you find lots of information, but a lot
 of it is contradictory, so people don’t know where to start,” said
 Duggin. He added: “If you look at something like the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG], they are really quite impenetrable and
 take a huge amount of time to get your head around.”
</p>
<p> 
 Other key findings from the research included that people often begin
 thinking about accessibility far too late into the lifecycle of a project
 – frequently when the project is about to be assessed and tested. “I
 guarantee that if that’s the first time you’ve thought about
 accessibility, you will find lots of issues … and that’s how
 accessibility becomes seen as a burden,” Duggin said.
</p>
<p> 
 What is needed is for teams to consider accessibility throughout the
 lifecycle of a project, said Duggin: “It makes [accessibility] much
 easier, it makes things more efficient, and you’re much more likely to
 design something good.”
</p>
<p> 
 As well as highlighting problems, the research was also used as a mechanism
 for finding solutions to the barriers faced by government teams. One
 solution was to provide clarity on what teams are expected to do. “Most
 people don’t know what it means to make something accessible,” said
 Duggin, “so you need to help people understand what the goal is.”
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Building empathy’ was another proposed solution. “You can give
 people a checklist, but if they haven’t bought-in to why they’re doing
 something, they’re not going to embrace it,” said Duggin.
</p>
<p> 
 Other solutions included: helping teams to identify accessibility barriers
 as early as possible; building accessibility into the templates and
 patterns that people regularly use, and; educating, encouraging and
 supporting people throughout the process, while avoiding being too critical
 or judging people when accessibility problems do arise.
</p>
<p> 
 Findings and results from the research will be published soon on the GDS
 blog.

<h3 id="i183-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Us Congress Called On To Create Technology Equality Bill.</h3>
<p> 
 The National Council on Disability (NCD) has made a series of
 recommendations to the United States Government on making technology more
 accessible, including a call to establish a ‘Technology Bill of Rights
 for People with Disabilities’.
</p>
<p> 
 Other recommendations called for by the NCD (which is tasked with advising
 key strands of the US Government on disability policy) include the
 following: action should be taken to clarify that the Americans with
 Disabilities Act applies to the internet, and; federal agencies in the US
 should take “aggressive steps” to comply with a law requiring that
 their ICT (information and communications technology) is accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The NCD made the recommendations in ‘National Disability Policy: A
 Progress Report’, its annual publication for the White House and
 Congress. These reports explore different themes each year, making
 recommendations to government on issues that affect the lives of people
 with disabilities. Technology was chosen as the focus for the 2016 report,
 “because of the potential that it holds to transform how people with
 disabilities experience the opportunities of citizenship in our society,”
 writes NCD Chairperson Clyde Terry in a letter to US President Barack
 Obama, which opens the report.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as addressing the US Government, the latest NCD report also makes
 recommendations to the technology industry (including encouraging people
 with disabilities to participate in user-testing when developing new
 products), and both the private and public sectors (including making sure
 that procedures for purchasing new technology result in accessible
 equipment).
</p>
<p> 
 The key recommendation to government is to establish a Technology Bill of
 Rights for People with Disabilities. This is needed because of an
 “absence of clear language” around organisations’ current obligations
 to provide accessible ICT, the report claims.
</p>
<p> 
 The bill would clarify the rights of people with disabilities and
 “demonstrate how existing legislation applies to ICT and assistive
 technology,” claims the report.
</p>
<p> 
 The NCD’s plan for creating the bill would involve “creating a Federal
 Advisory Committee to draft a Bill of Rights with a budget specifically
 authorized by Congress”. This committee would then help to increase both
 the supply and demand of accessible ICT systems through targeted work, as
 well as expanding technology expertise to assist with policymaking, and
 reviewing existing regulations.

<h3 id="i183-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Free Online Learning Course Opens Up Accessibility To All.</h3>
<p> 
 An online learning course on digital accessibility, designed by field
 experts from a computer science team, has been launched.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Digital Accessibility: Enabling Participation in the Information
 Society’ is free and open for anyone to enrol on, and no previous
 accessibility knowledge is required. The course aims to teach learners how
 accessible digital technologies can aid people with a range of impairments,
 as well as explaining the universal benefits of inclusive design.
</p>
<p> 
 Topics explored on the course include the following: ‘What is Digital
 Accessibility and why care?’; ‘Challenges and Barriers met by Disabled
 People, including Video and Audio Barriers and Subtitles’; ‘Desktop,
 Laptop and Mobile Accessibility’; ‘Digital Accessibility and
 Business’; and, ‘Screen Reader, Braille, Switch Access Technologies’.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘Digital Accessibility’ course is classified as a ‘MOOC’ –
 massive open online course – a term for online learning programmes with
 no limit on the number of people that can study them. So far, around 2,500
 people from more than 125 countries have signed up.
</p>
<p> 
 Course content has been designed by members of the Web and Internet Science
 (WAIS) research group within the Electronics and Computer Science (ECS)
 Accessibility Team from the University of Southampton.
</p>
<p> 
 The programme is being taught by Mike Wald – a professor at the
 University of Southampton leading a team that teaches digital accessibility
 – and E.A. Draffan – a senior research fellow and member of the
 university’s Electronics and Computer Science team.
</p>
<p> 
 Lead educator Mike Wald told e-Access Bulletin that after years of teaching
 digital accessibility at the university, the ECS team wanted to find a way
 to reach more people. Wald said that the course allows learners to
 “explore how a better understanding of users’ needs can enable the
 development of technologies that are accessible and provide a more
 inclusive environment.”
</p>
<p> 
 The course programme runs over five weeks on the Future Learn website, with
 approximately three hours per week of study time needed. Although the
 official start date was October 17, anyone is free to join at any point, as
 learners can study at their own pace and make up the extra time whenever
 they choose. Resources also remain available online after the course
 finishes. Wald said that he expects the programme to run again in February.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Digital Accessibility: Enabling Participation in the Information
 Society’ is supported by MOOCAP (MOOC Accessibility Partnership – a
 European project that provides education on accessible design) and funded
 by the ERASMUS+ grant programme of the European Union.

<p>  Helen Petrie, a Professor of Human Computer Interaction at the University of York, has a reader request for
 participants to take part in a study she is organising. The aim is to find
 out more about how people use mobility aids, as she explains:
</p>
<p> 
 “Professionals who work with people around their mobility aids, including
 doctors, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, say they have little
 idea about how people really use these aids when they leave the hospital or
 clinic.
</p>
<p> 
 “We would like to hear from as many people as possible about their
 mobility aids – what they like about them, any problems they have. We
 have a survey at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/39">http://eab.li/39</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 “We will also run a detailed study, placing small sensors on
 participants’ mobility aids. These sensors will pick up data about how
 and when the aid is being used, and we also ask people to answer a few
 questions using a smartphone app.
</p>
<p> 
 “The study will help us develop the app. Mobility aid users could then
 use the app to report problems to a health professional. We will also
 create a system for therapists to track information from their clients,
 which could help provide more effective treatment.

<p>  Rick Williams replies to a reader query from last month’s Bulletin. In our previous issue, Thomas Bryan from the Blind
 Foundation in New Zealand wrote in to ask for advice on making museum and
 gallery exhibitions and tours more accessible for people with sight loss.
</p>
<p> 
 Rick (who co-designed the Click-Away Pound survey to investigate the online
 shopping experience of people with disabilities) has experience in this
 area, from his work as Managing Director of disability consultancy Freeney
 Williams:
</p>
<p> 
 “We developed a free tactile tour for visually impaired people at the
 Houses of Parliament in London. This includes a tactile experience and
 guided tour of Westminster Hall, Central Lobby, the Lords Chambers in the
 House of Lords and the Commons Chamber in the House of Commons. Specially
 made models and tactile diagrams are available for visually impaired
 visitors, along with trained guides to facilitate the whole experience.”

<p>

Section Four: Special report.
- The Hackaday Assistive Technology Prize winners.

</p>
<p>  winners in their own words.</p>
<p> 
 In July, e-Access Bulletin reported on the Hackaday Prize, a competition
 that asks designers, developers and hardware enthusiasts to “build
 something that matters” – something that can help people or change the
 world for the better.
</p>
<p> 
 Of particular interest for Bulletin readers is the Assistive Technology
 category. Earlier this month, 20 winning assistive technology projects were
 selected from hundreds of entries.
</p>
<p> 
 Each received a cash prize of 1,000 US Dollars and moved to the final round
 of the competition, where five projects from across all categories will be
 chosen November 5. These are awarded larger cash prizes, including the
 overall competition winner, who receives $150,000 and a residency in a
 design lab to further develop their project.
</p>
<p> 
 As you might imagine, the winning entries from the assistive technology
 category were a fascinating and accomplished list, showcasing all kinds of
 innovative accessibility ideas. e-Access Bulletin contacted a selection of
 the winners and asked them to explain more about their projects, which
 we’ve detailed below.
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 1: Façade – tactile interfaces to appliances. Designed
 by Anhong Guo.
</p>
<p> 
 Anhong Guo: “Most common appliances have flat touchpads, making them
 inaccessible for blind people. Facade is a crowdsourced fabrication
 pipeline to generate 3D printed tactile interfaces for blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 “Assisted by the Facade iOS app, blind users capture a photo of an
 inaccessible interface, which is sent to crowd workers, who label and
 describe it. This is used to generate a 3D model for a layer of tactile
 buttons that fit over the controls.
</p>
<p> 
 “Blind people generally label appliances with Braille stickers, but doing
 so requires sighted assistance. Our solution is an end-to-end pipeline that
 can help blind people independently make appliance interfaces accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 “I’m glad that this technology is being acknowledged by others, and
 I’ll work hard to put it into the hands of blind people.”
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 2: BOSI – a Bluetooth open-source switch interface.
 Designed by Joshua Chung.
</p>
<p> 
 Joshua Chung: “I believe that using computers and mobile devices is going
 to be one of the most frequent daily activities in our life, especially for
 students with disabilities, and this should not be a limitation to them.
 So, I’ve been looking for cheap, easy solutions that high school students
 can build at home or school. The BOSI was designed to be a 3D-printable
 computer access device for computers and mobile devices. People who have
 difficulties using traditional physical input devices – like a keyboard,
 mouse or touch-screen – may benefit from it.
</p>
<p> 
 “The BOSI costs much less than commercial switch interfaces and is easy
 to make. Also, as BOSI is open-sourced, people with disabilities can modify
 and customise it for their individual needs.
</p>
<p> 
 “Computer use is going to be a crucial activity in our life and many
 people are still struggling with it. I hope this project brings in more
 people to face challenges that able-bodied people don’t have now, but may
 encounter one day.”
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 3: Shakelet – a wireless vibrating wristband to provide
 alerts to hearing impaired people. Designed by Alex Hunt.
</p>
<p> 
 Alex Hunt: “The inspiration came from a friend who has hearing
 difficulties. I wanted to make something that would allow her to interact
 with standard consumer technology without requiring expensive, specialised
 equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 “The Shakelet consists of a sensor and a receiver. The sensor is placed
 on whatever the user wishes to monitor, such as a doorbell or fire alarm.
 When that item goes off, a signal is sent to the receiver, notifying the
 user through a flashing light and vibrating motor. The project is unique
 because there is no specialist equipment required, and it has a very low
 component cost.”
</p>
<p> 
 “Being a Hackaday winner was fantastic and surprising. The standard of
 entries was very high and I was amazed to have been chosen. The next stage
 is to shrink the sensor to a size that can be integrated into a wristband.
 I would also like to add a Wi-Fi interface.”
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 4: MOLBED – a modular low cost Braille electronic
 display. Designed by Marin Davide.
</p>
<p> 
 Marin Davide: “I decided to develop an affordable alternative to current
 (expensive) refreshable Braille displays. It had to be low cost and easy to
 manufacture, if possible using commercial parts. I’m in touch with
 associations for people with impaired vision, and their help is important
 to design a product that is really useful.
</p>
<p> 
 “This project is unique because I used a new idea (a magnetic core with
 magnetic retaining on each end) that has never been used in a Braille
 display. It has a working prototype already, and the entire project is
 open-source, as I decided not to patent it, so that it is available for
 anyone to make.
</p>
<p> 
 “Here in Italy, it is difficult to get funds for this kind of project, so
 winning prize money gives this project the opportunity to be developed
 fully – having test units made, optimised, tested by users, and then
 produced in a first batch.”
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 5: Pallette – an open-source ‘tongue computer
 interface’. Designed by Dan Levine, Joanna Zhang, Oliver Hoffman, Rohit
 Jain, and Shawn Bramson.
</p>
<p> 
 Dan Levine: “We felt like the technology of today is functional, but
 often doesn’t consider appearance or obtrusiveness of a device.
 Tongue-based interaction, and the idea of discreet assistive technologies,
 can meaningfully help out.
</p>
<p> 
 “Hidden from view, Pallette enables people with spinal cord injuries and
 other mobility impairments to control technology using their tongue. It
 uses infrared sensors to track tongue motion and a microphone to detect
 tongue taps. It currently enables individuals to control computers, Android
 tablets, and Android phones as a Bluetooth mouse.
</p>
<p> 
 “The tongue interface has been explored before, but we’ve given it some
 new abilities and form. Pallette doesn’t require any buttons, meaning the
 tongue doesn’t get tired. It’s open-source and we have a website
 detailing how to make it – this is definitely a first for tongue
 interfaces. As far as we know, there are no commercial or other open-source
 tongue interfaces that exist today.
</p>
<p> 
 “We’re humbled and proud to have won. We’ve been working on Pallette
 for the last one-and-a-half years, and we really want to see it thrive and
 reach the people it’s meant for. It feels like a good beginning as we
 work to kick-start this community.”
</p>
<p> 
 Winning project 6: TNS B1i – an accessible prosthetic hand. Designed by
 Giovanni Leal and Jenny Pabon.
</p>
<p> 
 Giovanni Leal: “The hand opens and closes, makes gestures and lasts one
 week with a specific battery. It’s designed for people with transradial
 upper limb amputation. Just to change one person’s life would mean the
 world to us.
</p>
<p> 
 “Everybody is fixated on the fact that the hand only has four fingers –
 and we love it! We were worried about people’s reaction to it, but having
 four fingers on the hand really makes sense. Also, we built our own 3D
 printed microlinear actuators, making us independent from suppliers.
</p>
<p> 
 “We’re humbled to be a winner. The community [around the competition]
 is amazing. They praise you, give you advice and help you become a better
 maker.
</p>
<p> 
 “The goal is for the hand to be commercially available in December. We
 have a patent going on, but if anyone wants to make the hand to help
 another person, feel free and call us so we can see it afterwards and learn
 from your kindness.”
</p>
<p>
