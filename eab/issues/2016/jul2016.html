<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Top Travel Websites Still Failing Users With Disabilities, Reportuncovers.
</h3>
<p> 
 Many of the most popular travel companies are still not making their
 websites accessible, new research has found.
</p>
<p> 
 The report (named ‘Are travel companies burying their heads in the sand
 when it comes to user experience and accessibility?’, compiled by digital
 user experience agency Sigma), tested ten of the most popular travel
 websites in the UK over three main categories: accessibility; usability;
 ease of use on different devices.
</p>
<p> 
 The accessibility testing uncovered a wide range of problems across the
 sites for users with disabilities, particularly those with visual
 impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 The ten sites tested were: Airbnb, Booking.com, British Airways,
 Co-operative Travel, Expedia, lastminute.com, LateRooms, On the Beach,
 Skyscanner and Virgin Atlantic.
</p>
<p> 
 Molly Watt, an independent accessibility consultant and founder of the
 Molly Watt Trust charity, tested the travel sites as part of the report.
 Watt, who has Usher syndrome, was born deaf and is registered blind,
 retaining a small degree of vision.
</p>
<p> 
 Problems that Watt discovered with the sites included: colours and fonts
 being “too garish”; zooming features being disabled; cluttered content;
 and “design-based trends” on web pages, such as text over images, or
 moving images.
</p>
<p> 
 Watt told e-Access Bulletin that the biggest improvement travel websites
 need to make is to “simplify”. Giving examples of this, she said:
 “Travel websites need to avoid temporary pop-ups, as they can confuse or
 worry some users who might then think they have missed an important message
 … Colour contrasts also need to be improved, especially in drop-down
 menus and calendars – these are all crucial details.”
</p>
<p> 
 A number of other accessibility problems were also found. Only two sites
 (Expedia and Virgin Atlantic) were rated as being compatible with a
 screen-reader, some sites had switched off the zoom function, many images
 weren’t accompanied by alt text, and not all sites were navigable with
 the ‘tab’ key.
</p>
<p> 
 The travel site with the highest overall accessibility score was Expedia,
 which scored 10 out of a possible 11. Co-operative Travel scored lowest,
 achieving just 1 out of 11 (colour contrast, confusing drop-down menus and
 overly busy page layouts were some of the reasons given).
</p>
<p> 
 Watt told e-Access Bulletin that travel companies are missing out on
 business by not properly catering for users with disabilities. “So much
 is advertised online these days. It’s ridiculous, therefore, that these
 websites aren’t fully accessible, and as a result, disabled users are
 missing out. Something needs to change, and fast.”
</p>
<p> 
 This view is supported by a summary of key findings at the end of the
 report, including an observation that although accessibility is crucial,
 many travel websites still aren’t prioritising it. The report says: “If
 companies continue to ignore accessibility, they could be isolating
 millions of users, risking reputation, customer loyalty, and profits.”

<h3 id="i181-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Guide On Home Technology Launched For People With Sight Loss.</h3>
<p> 
 The “blurring” of assistive technology and inclusive design into
 mainstream technology is helping to provide both high-end and everyday
 devices that can benefit visually impaired people around the home, claims a
 new publication.
</p>
<p> 
 Talking microwaves, smart watches, audio thermometers, e-readers and online
 banking apps are some of the innovations featured in ‘Assistive and
 Inclusive Home Technology: A guide for people with sight loss’. The free
 guide has just been published by UK sight loss charity Thomas Pocklington
 Trust, and covers a wide range of devices that can improve independent
 living. Assistive technology funding information and tips for product
 designers are also highlighted.
</p>
<p> 
 Subject areas covered include: household chores; home shopping and finance;
 health, fitness and wellbeing; reading and writing; entertainment and
 leisure. The guide provides a thorough introduction to the many useful
 technologies available for visually impaired people in these areas, as well
 as explaining the difficulties and pitfalls with existing devices.
</p>
<p> 
 One of these difficulties is the increasing use of digital and touch-screen
 displays on household appliances, such as boilers, which can be difficult
 or impossible to control for someone with a visual impairment. The guide
 notes that: “Modern appliances can be an accessibility rollercoaster,
 with many ovens, microwaves, dishwashers, washers and dryers being hard to
 operate by people with sight loss.”
</p>
<p> 
 However, many useful exceptions are explained, such as a combined washing
 machine and dryer that uses audio description to tell users about different
 washing cycles.
</p>
<p> 
 Both everyday devices and hi-spec technologies can benefit people around
 the home, the guide says – for example, in home security: “Some recent
 technology trends threaten to undermine home access and security for
 visually impaired people, with concerns that touch-screen-reliant systems
 could make front doors inaccessible. On the other hand, biometric security
 technology can improve accessibility, with fingerprint locking mechanisms
 making it unnecessary for people to have to fiddle around finding the right
 key and guiding it into the keyhole. Lower-tech solutions such as keys with
 in-built torches and basic intercom systems can also assist people.”
</p>
<p> 
 A series of real-life case studies are also highlighted in the guide, with
 accounts of visually impaired people using assistive and inclusive
 technology to help with everyday tasks, like reading books, cooking, mowing
 the lawn, and blogging.
</p>
<p> 
 Also included in the guide are hints and tips on getting to grips with
 technology, a checklist for finding the right device, funding options for
 purchasing assistive technology, and a selection of other resources.
</p>

<h3 id="i181-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Innovation And Impact Honoured At Tech4good Awards.</h3>
<p> 
 A digital audio navigation system and a portable asthma management device
 are two of the winners in this year’s Tech4Good Awards, which recognises
 projects and individuals that are using technology to improve lives.
</p>
<p> 
 People honoured at the event included an IT volunteer who helped to set up
 a charity by establishing its ICT systems, and digital inclusion expert and
 campaigner Robin Christopherson.
</p>
<p> 
 Now in its sixth year, Tech4Good (organised by technology access charity
 AbilityNet) features ten categories, including awards for accessibility,
 digital health, community impact, digital skills, and a ‘people’s
 award’.
</p>
<p> 
 Winners at the 2016 event – announced at a ceremony in London earlier
 this month – included Wayfindr, which received the AbilityNet
 Accessibility Award. Wayfindr is a set of tools for developing audio
 navigation systems which can help visually impaired people navigate the
 built environment.
</p>
<p> 
 Wayfindr CEO Umesh Pandya told e-Access Bulletin that the team were
 “truly honoured” to win: “It is an incredible recognition of our
 efforts supporting vision-impaired people to navigate the world
 independently. It is indicative of a move across the sector towards weaving
 accessibility into mainstream technology,” said Pandya.
</p>
<p> 
 (Read e-Access Bulletin’s interview with Wayfindr from issue 180, at the
 link below:
 <a href="http://eab.li/1t">http://eab.li/1t</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Other winning projects included Neighbourly (a platform to connect
 charities with businesses and people that can donate time or funds), BBC
 micro:bit (a pocket-sized programmable computer given out in schools to
 teach children coding and digital skills) and AsthmaPi (a portable,
 affordable device that helps children manage their asthma and prevent
 severe attacks by recognising triggers).
</p>
<p> 
 The AsthmaPi was built by nine-year-old Arnav Sharma, who won the
 ‘People’s Award’ and the ‘Winner of Winners’ Award chosen by the
 audience at the ceremony. Sharma told e-Access Bulletin that he was “very
 happy but also overwhelmed” to win. He said: “I am really thankful that
 I won these awards and for all the nice things everyone said.”
</p>
<p> 
 Individuals recognised at the Tech4Good Awards included Maureen Johnston,
 who won IT Volunteer of the Year. Johnston volunteers at The Silver Line, a
 free helpline for older people, and has helped the charity to grow by
 setting up a virtual call centre. This centre assists volunteers with
 speaking to older people who use the service.
</p>
<p> 
 Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at AbilityNet, received a
 Tech4Good Special Award for his 20-plus years experience in promoting and
 advising on digital skills (see this month’s feature – the final item
 in e-Access Bulletin – for an in-depth interview with Robin
 Christopherson).

Section Three: Q &amp; A.
- Robin Christopherson, AbilityNet.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Steering Digital Inclusion From The Driving Seat.</h3>
<p> 
 When he helped co-found UK technology access charity AbilityNet in 1998,
 Robin Christopherson was already on his way to helping drive forward
 digital accessibility, and since then his work has continued to change
 people’s lives. He is now AbilityNet’s head of digital inclusion, after
 helping to grow the charity’s services. These services include website
 and mobile accessibility consultancy, which AbilityNet now delivers to
 companies including Microsoft, the BBC, HSBC and Sainsbury’s.
</p>
<p> 
 Christopherson has also led and worked on all manner of projects and
 campaigns to increase digital accessibility, particularly for blind and
 visually impaired people. This has included providing expert commentary for
 news sources such as The Guardian, and presenting on and testing new
 technology, whether that’s a driverless car or the latest smartwatch.
</p>
<p> 
 In recognition of his invaluable contributions, he was surprised with a
 special award at the annual Tech4Good Awards earlier this month. e-Access
 Bulletin caught up with Christopherson to find out more about his work and
 get his thoughts on the evolution of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 - Tell us about your work at AbilityNet and how it’s changed over the
 years:
</p>
<p> 
 “AbilityNet is all about empowering people through accessibility and
 technology, and has been changing lives since 1998. As a blind person,
 I’m just one example of how tech has helped improve the life choices for
 people with disabilities. We now have all the power of computers with us
 wherever we go, and with a range of sensors – such as camera, GPS,
 accelerometer and compass – that can be incredibly empowering when one or
 more of your own senses don’t work.
</p>
<p> 
 “Whereas a disabled person used to have to purchase expensive (and often
 limited) devices, they can often now use mainstream gadgets, such as
 smartphones, that have all the necessary accessibility features built-in,
 and which offer thousands of apps that perform the same functions for a
 fraction of the price.
</p>
<p> 
 “I used to need a talking GPS device (&pound;750), a talking notetaker
 (&pound;1,500), a talking barcode scanner (&pound;150) and many more specialist
 devices. Now, I have all that functionality and an awful lot more in one
 device. That same device is also almost infinitely expandable with each new
 app or service that comes along.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What kinds of work were you doing before AbilityNet?
</p>
<p> 
 “I was an IT instructor for the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB), and was able to play with (I mean ‘research’) incredible
 technologies, such as screen-reading software for Windows, flatbed scanners
 that can read back-printed materials and talking notetakers.
</p>
<p> 
 “In the UK today, 90% of jobs include a computer of some sort, and these
 technologies helped make many more careers possible. That said, 73% of
 people with a vision impairment in the UK are still without paid work,
 which is why I feel so strongly about the main aspect of my work today –
 regular public speaking to both conference and corporate audiences. If
 you’d like to see these strong messages about the empowering potential of
 tech, simply Google me or search on YouTube or Vimeo.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How has digital accessibility improved over the time you’ve been
 working in the sector?
</p>
<p> 
 “The accessibility of devices has been transformed in recent years,
 driven largely by Apple. Apple has led the way and shamed or energised
 others to follow. Disabled people are using their smartphones to aid
 mobility, manage their health, interact with more people, play an active
 part in commerce and also have a lot of fun. The accessibility of the Mac
 and i-devices has ‘mainstreamed’ inclusion and, because of its
 influence on Android and other manufacturers, this has meant inclusion is
 now more affordable than ever.
</p>
<p> 
 “The accessibility of these devices has also impacted a second area, web
 and app accessibility, and there are tens of thousands of accessible apps
 to choose from – replacing hard or impossible-to-use websites. This has
 had a massive impact on choice for disabled people. As a blind person I
 would always reach first for an app which is a more accessible, cleaner and
 more distilled user experience. Actually, I would first reach for Siri to
 see if the information or interaction I want can be done in a few seconds
 flat.
</p>
<p> 
 “Having said that, I actually use my phone considerably less since
 getting my smartwatch, which is like a quick window into my phone’s most
 commonly used features. It taps me on the wrist when I need to turn down
 the next street, it means I can pay for items without even taking my phone
 out of my pocket, and it lets me know how bad my night’s sleep has been
 – but behind the watch and all its services is always the smartphone.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Is accessibility now more of a mainstream issue than it used to be?
</p>
<p> 
 “The concept of digital accessibility is now not only more mainstream an
 issue – it is, in fact, a purely mainstream issue. So,
 ‘accessibility’ (with its historical connotations of being solely for
 the disabled user, requiring extra budget and being a ‘bolt-on’ that
 may be dropped off) should probably now be replaced with the idea of
 ‘inclusive design’. Inclusive design is for every user and is
 factored-in from the very start of any project, informing every decision
 along the way.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What can be done to improve the state of digital accessibility?
</p>
<p> 
 “The single most impactful development that will see a seismic shift is
 for government to actually enforce the law. This sounds odd, but I
 explained it in a recent open letter to the UK Government (link to
 Robin’s letter below:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2f">http://eab.li/2f</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 “To summarise, it’s been a legal requirement to have an accessible
 website since 2003, and yet we estimate that more than 90% of websites in
 the UK still don’t even meet ‘single-A’ standard [of the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines], let alone ‘AA’, which is arguably the legal
 requirement.
</p>
<p> 
 “The trouble is that authorities don’t appear to feel that checking for
 compliance is their job. Instead it’s been left to individuals or those
 representing them, such as the RNIB, to help enforce the law. You can
 barely leave your car one minute over time without getting a parking
 ticket, but where are the government’s wardens of the internet? The law
 on accessibility matters too – arguably much more so for those disabled
 users directly impacted, and more widely for our digital economy.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What have been some of the most exciting projects you’ve worked on?
</p>
<p> 
 “This is going to sound quite pedestrian in light of the amazing
 technologies available today, but I think that AbilityNet’s ongoing
 involvement in the accessibility of Microsoft products is something I’m
 most proud of. When I consider how many people we’ve potentially helped
 by assisting in the accessibility of Microsoft Windows and Office, etc,
 I’d have to say that this was some of our work that I am most proud
 of.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What has been your biggest achievement?
</p>
<p> 
 “I’d hope that my involvement with the UK Government Digital Strategy,
 and my blogs and public speaking, have impacted people’s lives for the
 better. I’m also very proud to have been a judge in the recent Global
 Mobile Awards in Barcelona, and to have received two recent awards: runner
 up in the 2015 UK Digital Leaders Awards (after Baroness Martha Lane Fox)
 and the special award at this year’s Tech4Good event.
</p>
<p> 
 - How did it feel to receive the Tech4Good Award?
</p>
<p> 
 “It was amazing, although I was totally unprepared, unlike the winners of
 the other categories, who had been shortlisted in advance. I had just
 finished my on-stage presentation about the power of tech, and suddenly
 they were asking me to stay on the stage, and presenting me with an award.
 The Tech4Good Awards are for the best of the best – recognising people
 and products that are changing lives for the better – so to be part of
 that excellent process is truly humbling. I’m still getting over the
 shock!”
</p>
<p> 
 - You recently tested a driverless car. Tell us about that.
</p>
<p> 
 “I had a taste of potential future adventures behind the wheel when a
 colleague gave me the opportunity to ‘drive’ his Tesla [a company that
 makes self-driving cars]. Okay, so I wasn’t actually driving, but I sat
 in the driver’s seat with my feet off the pedals, while my colleague
 summoned the car into auto-drive mode.

 “I could feel the wheel turning in my hands as the car moved out of the
 parking space. Were it legal to use a fully autonomous car on UK highways,
 I would have headed off into the sunset, but currently it’s only legal to
 do this off public roads. So instead, we reversed the process with the
 auto-park button and I slid back into a parking space. For many people,
 that doesn’t sound like much, but growing up and knowing that my vision
 would get worse until I had none, I thought I’d never be able to drive.
 However, things are changing fast.”

 - What have been some of the most important developments in technology for
 blind and visually impaired people in recent years?
</p>
<p> 
 “The top three most significant developments for blind users are, in
 order: 1. The smartphone. 2. The smartphone. 3. The smartphone. To give the
 merest inkling of how broad the uses of the smartphone are for vision
 impaired users, take a brief look at the AppleVis site that catalogues
 hundreds of people’s favourite accessible iOS apps.” (link to AppleVis
 site below:

 ).</p>
<p> 
 - Are there any accessibility developments that you’re excited about for
 the coming years?
</p>
<p> 
 “One area that is seeing significant growth is wearable tech and the
 ‘quantified self’. This means that gadgets which monitor your steps,
 exercise and heart rate are encouraging a healthier lifestyle and gathering
 data which can assist on a personal diagnosis level. Apple is leading the
 way in these areas; the Apple Watch, for example, is totally accessible and
 can monitor a wide range of activities.
</p>
<p> 
 “As a blind person, I can use the stair-stepper workout to go up and down
 the stairs at home (who needs a gym?), and all my calories burned and heart
 rate activity are measured. This data can provide valuable information for
 monitoring individual health, but Apple also has a much broader programme
 (called ‘Research Kit’) that is taking anonymous, aggregated data and
 making it available to medical research projects on a scale never available
 before.
</p>
<p> 
 “Another area that has huge potential is the connected home, also known
 as the ‘Internet of Things’ or IOT. We’re all familiar with devices
 like heating thermostats being controlled via an app or smartwatch, but
 what isn’t always appreciated is that those apps are often more
 accessible than the device’s own interface.
</p>
<p> 
 “Now imagine if your cooker could talk to you via an app and tell you
 when it had reached the correct temperature. It might help a blind person
 like myself be a better cook. Imagine if your doorbell had a webcam with
 face-recognition technology – how helpful would that be for someone with
 dementia who lives alone? What about a medicine dispenser that tells you if
 you’ve forgotten to take your tablets, or can inform the doctor if you
 need a fresh prescription? Many of these technologies already exist.
</p>
<p> 
 “For disabled and older people, wearable technologies and smarter homes
 will undoubtedly deliver greater choice, control, peace of mind and
 independence. While it is impossible to say which device or technology will
 have the biggest impact going forward, at the heart of it will undoubtedly
 remain the smartphone.”
