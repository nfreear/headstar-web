<h3 id="i178-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Low-Cost Refreshable Braille Display Set To Revolutionise The Market.</h3>
<p> 
 A device that could become ‘the world’s most affordable refreshable
 Braille display’ – costing around 80-90% less than current systems –
 has been unveiled, and should be available for purchase later this year.
</p>
<p> 
 The Orbit Reader 20 was announced at the Annual International Technology
 and Persons with Disabilities Conference – known as CSUN – in the
 United States, by the Chair of the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB), Kevin Carey, in his role as president of the Transforming Braille
 Group (TBG).
</p>
<p> 
 TBG was conceived to realise and produce an affordable refreshable Braille
 display, partly as a way to give people in developing countries greater
 access to refreshable Braille. Current devices are prohibitively expensive,
 often running into thousands of US Dollars or British Pounds. TBG set about
 raising 1.25 million US Dollars for the Orbit Reader 20 to be produced by
 assistive technology company Orbit Research (further background in a
 previous e-Access Bulletin at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/v">http://eab.li/v</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Refreshable Braille displays allow blind or visually impaired users to read
 text from a computer screen via a system of small rods in Braille cells.
 These rods are electronically raised and lowered, creating readable Braille
 that constantly changes, or ‘refreshes’, as the user scrolls or moves
 across the screen.
</p>
<p> 
 The Orbit Reader 20 features 20 Braille cells and can be connected to a
 computer or mobile phone via USB or Bluetooth. There is also an SD card
 slot to enable loading and reading of books and other files.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to e-Access Bulletin, Carey explained that the aim is for the
 Orbit Reader 20 to be sold for $320 per unit, but this is dependant on
 Orbit Research receiving enough pre-orders for the device: “Orbit need an
 order of 200,000 to make the optimum price of $320 a unit, so what
 they’re doing is collecting wholesale orders. If it’s below 200,000,
 the price goes up,” Carey said.
</p>
<p> 
 On its website, Orbit Research claims that the Orbit Reader 20 will be the
 “world’s most affordable refreshable Braille display”.
</p>
<p> 
 User-testing of the Orbit Reader took place in January on 27 prototype
 machines, in North America and Europe, by testers both with and without
 experience of refreshable Braille systems. Carey will be supervising
 further testing in India and Kenya. Speaking about the results of this
 testing in his CSUN speech, Carey said that the refreshable Braille on the
 Orbit Reader was “the best that experienced users have ever seen”.
</p>
<p> 
 The refresh rate on the device was found to be suitable for
 “poor-to-average” Braille-users, but not effective enough for
 “experienced users”. However, as Carey then pointed out: “Those who
 have reported dissatisfaction with the refresh rate are very experienced
 users of high-end refreshable Braille note-takers or Braille bars attached
 to generic devices – but it is important to note that these are precisely
 the Braille readers for whom the Orbit Reader was not designed.” (Read
 Kevin Carey’s CSUN speech in full at the Transforming Braille Group’s
 website: <a href="http://eab.li/r">http://eab.li/r</a>
 .)</p>
<p> 
 Carey told e-Access Bulletin that the device could be revolutionary for
 visually impaired Braille-users due to its low cost. “Whichever way you
 look at it, the [price] is just way below anything anybody else is
 offering,” he said. Carey also pointed out that the timing of when the
 Orbit Reader will be available, “is simply to do with how fast the orders
 come in [to Orbit Research].”
</p>
<p> 
 The Orbit Reader 20 isn’t yet available to purchase by the general
 public, but Orbit Research’s website says that the device will be
 available in “late 2016”. It appears that when it does go on sale, the
 Reader will be sold through the website of the American Printing House for
 the Blind (APH), one of the shareholders in the project.

<h3 id="i178-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Integrate Accessibility Into Teaching Practices, Says Field Expert.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility should be weaved into more educational curriculums and
 demonstrated in teaching, a specialist consultant told delegates at a
 recent conference.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the ‘Digital Accessibility in Higher and Further Education
 Conference 2016’, David Sloan, a user experience engineer from
 accessibility agency The Paciello Group, said that accessibility needs to
 be integrated into the fabric of any curriculum featuring digital content
 creation, and can no longer be taught in isolation.
</p>
<p> 
 “It’s not something we can treat as a specialism, that inevitably
 becomes a class that somebody can skip because they are busy or doing
 something else,” Sloan said.
</p>
<p> 
 He went on to say that accessible communication is a “core digital
 literacy” that everyone should develop. “It’s not something we [can]
 leave to computing science to teach and everyone else can forget about. If
 we are thinking about digital literacy as a general concept that we want
 our employees of the future to acquire and use, then accessible
 communication needs to be part of that,” Sloan said.
</p>
<p> 
 Another crucial challenge, said Sloan, is for educators to directly apply
 inclusive practices when teaching: “Too often, I have seen [a situation]
 where somebody will stand up and talk about accessibility, saying something
 like: ‘Here’s an example of an inaccessible image that doesn’t have
 appropriate alt text, as you can see in the slide beside me.’ Hang on a
 minute, you are talking about an accessibility issue and assuming that
 everybody can see the slide on the screen.”
</p>
<p> 
 Addressing these kinds of oversights through inclusive teaching should be a
 “core professional skill” among educators, said Sloan: “A failure to
 do that weakens the message that digital accessibility is a core skill that
 our learners should be acquiring.”
</p>
<p> 
 The conference was sponsored by BCS (the British Computer Society), and
 took place in London. More information about the presentations can be found

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Technology Company Wins Award For ‘Helping Kids Learn’ Across Theglobe.
</h3>
<p> 
 A UK assistive technology company has been given a prestigious business
 award for exporting an e-learning software package for children with
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 Inclusive Technology – which provides equipment for individuals with
 physical disabilities, sensory impairments or learning difficulties –
 received a Queen’s Award for Enterprise for its HelpKidzLearn product.
 HelpKidzLearn features games, activities and tools designed for young
 children with a range of specialist learning needs.
</p>
<p> 
 The company was recognised in the ‘International Trade’ category of the
 Queen’s Award for Enterprise (an annual event that commends a range UK
 business achievements), for signing up over 25,000 paying subscribers to
 HelpKidzLearn across 148 countries.
</p>
<p> 
 The United States is the largest user of HelpKidzLearn, and the product is
 also being used in 14 countries across Europe, in eight different
 languages.
</p>
<p> 
 The basic HelpKidzLearn package costs &pound;55/$99 for one annual subscription
 (the idea is for a teacher or parent to purchase the subscription, and use
 the package with a child). Other multiple subscriptions (for use in
 schools, with multiple learners) can also be purchased. The package
 provides over 80 activities designed to aid learning.
</p>
<p> 
 The activities – including games, quizzes, stories and songs – can be
 accessed on a range of devices and equipment, such as keyboard switches,
 touch-screen, rollerball mouse and eye-tracking technology. A free, basic
 version of HelpKidzLearn is also available, featuring ten activities (Read
 more at the HelpKidzLearn website: <a href="http://eab.li/o">http://eab.li/o</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Chairman, CEO and co-founder of Inclusive Technology Martin Littler – who
 also founded the British Assistive Technology Association (BATA) – will
 collect the award at Buckingham Palace, London, in July. In a statement on
 the Inclusive Technology website, Littler said: “I am absolutely
 delighted with this brilliant award, which I feel recognises the huge
 contribution that the whole British assistive technology industry has made
 during the past 40 years. Of course, the award is also a huge pat on the
 back for our team of developers, teachers and therapists, all of whom get a
 buzz from producing resources which can transform the lives of learners
 with special educational needs and disabilities.”

<p>  Long-time bulletin reader Anthony Bernard writes in from Sri Lanka to express support for an item featured in this very
 issue – the affordable refreshable Braille display masterminded by the
 Transforming Braille Group (TBG). The topic was first covered by e-Access
 Bulletin in 2014, when Dan Jellinek reported on an initial one million
 dollar funding-boost for the project (read Dan’s 2014 news report at the
 following link: <a href="http://eab.li/v">http://eab.li/v</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Anthony was pleased to hear about the unveiling of the new device (and its
 intended price tag of 320 US Dollars) when he read the online transcript of
 a speech by TBG founder Kevin Carey, from the device launch at a recent
 assistive technology conference.
</p>
<p> 
 “I read the launching speech from Kevin Carey and was much encouraged. If
 Kevin wants me to be one of the testers and suggest ideas, I am available.
 We in developing countries will welcome this new product. It promises to
 give another lease of life to Braille. $320, or even $350, is not too much
 to ask for a Braille display, considering the more advanced displays
 costing thousands of dollars. Please keep me updated with the latest
 developments of this product.”

<p>  Steve Brazier, another long-time bulletin reader, writes in with an information request about virtual reality equipment as a
 potential viewing aid, and to express his sadness at the passing of
 e-Access Bulletin editor and founder Dan Jellinek.
</p>
<p> 
 “I’m so sorry to hear about Dan. We never met, but had corresponded
 over the years since the Bulletin began. It is very good that the bulletin
 is going again. I wanted to ask if anyone had information on virtual
 reality headsets or goggles. I wondered if a partially sighted user might
 be able to maximise the use of their peripheral vision by viewing live TV,
 a smartphone screen or a PC screen via such a headset.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have suffered from macular degeneration [a condition which affects
 central vision of the eye], due to myopic maculopathy, and for years have
 watched TV with ‘8x’ magnification binoculars, mounted on a microphone
 stand. Even football matches are reasonably easy to see. It struck me that
 if any virtual reality headsets allowed live video input, they might do the
 job even better.”

Section Three: Special report.
- ICT barriers for older people.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: How Can We Keep In Touch With Technology?</h3>
<p> 
 By Kate Hamblin and Sue Yeandle.
</p>
<p> 
 All too often, the deterioration of sight and hearing are seen as ‘just
 part of getting older’, and as a result are under-reported and
 inadequately assessed. When hearing and vision are both impaired, they
 present a unique challenge which requires new strategies and management.
 It’s estimated that 222,000 people in the UK aged over 70 have dual
 sensory impairment (DSI), and that by 2030 that number will be close to
 418,000. Recognising this, UK deafblind charity Sense established a
 research team in 2010 to undertake new projects evaluating the impact of
 DSI across the lifespan. One of these projects created a screening tool for
 DSI for use in residential care settings, while another project explored
 issues related to living independently in older age with DSI.
</p>
<p> 
 A study at the University of Sheffield, ‘Keeping in Touch with
 Technology?’, is part of this research, and explores the use of assistive
 technology and telecare by older adults with DSI. Sense commissioned the
 study in 2014 and we completed it in 2015. The University of Sheffield’s
 CIRCLE (Centre for International Research on Care, Labour and Equalities)
 worked with Sense and the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing to examine
 issues related to the challenges faced by older adults with DSI, and the
 role of assistive technology and telecare devices in promoting active and
 independent lives.
</p>
<p> 
 As part of a previous study that looked at independence in later life, we
 regularly visited elderly participants over a period of 4-6 months, to
 explore their use of technology and their wider lives. This included their
 personal biographies, relationships, communities and health. We adapted
 this methodology for our work with Sense and our research team, making 146
 household visits to 38 older adults with varying degrees of DSI. These
 adults had a variety of assistive technology and telecare in place, ranging
 from quite ‘low-tech’ devices to expensive, highly specialist
 equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 We explored participants’ use of technology in managing difficulties they
 faced in everyday life. These difficulties were arranged into three groups:
 activities outside the home (transport, shopping, socialising); activities
 inside the home (household chores, personal care); and, communicating with
 others. Some participants had coped well with single sensory impairment for
 many years, but now had to adjust to the deterioration of the other sense
 on which they had previously relied. Technology could sometimes help: GPS
 devices helped with navigation, ‘talking’ kitchen technology items made
 cooking easier, and personal loop systems and Braille displays promoted
 communication.
</p>
<p> 
 In some situations, technology gave people with DSI valuable extra support,
 but there were also barriers in using and accessing technology. Some felt
 intimidated by technology, or felt that it was not “for them”. Limited
 awareness was another barrier – people in the study were often unsure
 what technology was available, and even if they felt an item of equipment
 might be useful, they found the huge variety of manufacturers and suppliers
 confusing and off-putting. Specialist technology can be very expensive, so
 making choices based on limited information or experience was deemed to be
 “risky”.
</p>
<p> 
 Cost and choice were also major barriers. Those who had resources felt that
 some equipment was prohibitively expensive, while those who relied on
 equipment provided by their local authority said their choice was limited.
 Some participants felt their local authority’s assessment for equipment
 focused only on safety and risk, and failed to address other needs or give
 them access to activities where technology could help.
</p>
<p> 
 Some felt that the products they had tried were not “fit for purpose”,
 and that a lot of equipment had been designed with only single-sensory
 impairment in mind. Participants felt that using these devices involved a
 “compromise”, and in many of our research visits, the team saw
 assistive technology equipment which had been abandoned. Inadequate
 training and follow-up support was another issue, with some participants
 unsure as to how to use their devices correctly, or what to do if they went
 wrong.
</p>
<p> 
 Our findings indicate that service providers, equipment suppliers and
 product developers need to do more to meet the needs of older people with
 DSI – the size of this group is growing fast, just as technology is also
 advancing at a rapid rate. Where technology was successfully adopted, the
 following things happened: participants felt much safer at home; they were
 using public transport alone; they could manage everyday chores unaided;
 and they enjoyed new modes of communication and social interactions.
</p>
<p> 
 However, we also found worrying barriers to accessing and using technology.
 To address this, we recommend an increase in awareness-raising and
 campaigning around technology and DSI. This will help older people with DSI
 find out what products are available, and where and how they can obtain
 them. We also highlight the importance of raising awareness of the needs of
 people with DSI in the product-design community. This will ensure that, in
 future, products are developed with this growing group firmly in mind.
