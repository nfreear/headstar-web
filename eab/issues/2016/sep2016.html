<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: World’S First ‘Bionic Olympics’ Will Tackle Everyday Obstacleswith Assistive Tech.
</h3>
<p> 
 Cutting bread, climbing stairs and unwrapping a sugar cube all feature as
 competitions in an event being dubbed the ‘world’s first bionic
 Olympics’, which will set out to show how advanced technologies can help
 people with disabilities in daily life.
</p>
<p> 
 Taking place in Kloten, Switzerland, on October 8, the Cybathlon
 championship features six types of contest, with disabled competitors using
 and controlling assistive devices and robotic technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 The events will test how these technologies allow users to complete
 day-to-day tasks. For example, in the ‘powered leg prosthesis race’,
 competitors (referred to as “pilots”, as they need to control or steer
 their technology) are timed using leg prosthetics to navigate stairs,
 slopes and uneven surfaces.
</p>
<p> 
 In the ‘powered arm prosthesis race’, competitors with an arm
 amputation and prosthetic must complete tasks such as: cutting and
 spreading jam on a slice of bread, carrying a tray of items to a table,
 opening a door and fitting a light bulb.
</p>
<p> 
 Cybathlon was created by Robert Riener, head of Health Sciences and
 Technology, and Professor of Sensory-Motor Systems at the ETH Zurich
 university in Switzerland. Riener told e-Access Bulletin that he was
 inspired to start the event when he decided through his daily work that
 “current assistive technologies are not functional enough and not
 accepted by many people.”
</p>
<p> 
 Further inspiration for Cybathlon came after Riener read a newspaper
 article about a man with a motorised knee prosthesis running up 103 floors
 of Chicago’s Willis Tower.
</p>
<p> 
 Explaining the concept behind Cybathlon, Riener said: “We want to promote
 the development of useful, acceptable, assistive devices for people with
 motor disabilities, and not just find the strongest and fastest person with
 a disability. That is why we have designed race tracks and obstacles that
 have a meaning for daily life.”
</p>
<p> 
 Competitors in Cybathlon are not professional athletes, and instead have to
 master the devices and technology they use in the events. “That is why we
 call them ‘pilots’,” said Riener.
</p>
<p> 
 The technologies used are largely specialist and highly advanced. Asked if
 it presents a problem that many disabled people can’t access or afford
 these technologies, Riener said: “It is normal that the newest high-tech
 is most expensive … However, we need new devices popping-up to shift
 previous ideas. High-tech will become used by a broader population and
 become cheaper, if it functions well. Furthermore, we urge politicians to
 give larger funding to high-tech devices for people with disabilities.”
</p>
<p> 
 A total of 74 athletes from 25 countries will take part in Cybathlon. Other
 contests include the ‘powered wheelchair race’, the ‘powered
 exoskeleton race’, the ‘functional electrical stimulation bike race’
 (‘pilots’ with a spinal cord injury – SCI – pedal bikes by
 stimulating their muscles with electrodes), and the ‘brain-computer
 interface race’ (‘pilots’ with an SCI navigate computer game avatars
 purely through technology that reads their brain signals).

<h3 id="i182-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: ‘Hidden’ Sight Loss And Dementia Tackled In Technology Campaign.</h3>
<p> 
 The Scottish arm of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, RNIB
 Scotland, has signed-up to the Technology Charter for People Living with
 Dementia.
</p>
<p> 
 Originally launched in December 2015, the charter was developed by
 organisations including Alzheimer Scotland, NHS Scotland and the Scottish
 Government. It encourages greater use of technology in health and social
 care for people with dementia, and features six key values, including:
 “Routes and access to technology are ethical, equitable, simple,
 understandable and user-friendly.”
</p>
<p> 
 As well as promoting technology as an aid for people living with dementia
 and their carers, by signing the charter, RNIB Scotland are also hoping to
 raise awareness of ‘hidden’ sight loss.
</p>
<p> 
 June Neil – training and development manager for older people and complex
 needs at RNIB Scotland – told e-Access Bulletin that signs of sight loss
 can go unrecognised in some people living with dementia, as the symptoms
 are instead attributed to that condition.
</p>
<p> 
 Neil said: “Symptoms such as: not recognising faces, becoming
 disinterested in hobbies, or not going out because someone can’t see the
 numbers on buses – all of those things could be because of dementia or
 could be because of sight loss, and [the individual] is unable to
 communicate these changes.”
</p>
<p> 
 The charter lists a wide variety of benefits that technology can bring to
 people living with dementia, including: reducing isolation and increasing
 communication with others; supporting memory and decision-making; and,
 reducing the risk of accidents.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, the MindMate app (available at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2p">http://eab.li/2p</a>
 ) helps to increase independent living for people with dementia. The app
 provides reminders and gives advice about nutrition and exercise.
</p>
<p> 
 Sandra Shafii from Alzheimer Scotland told e-Access Bulletin that the
 Scottish Dementia Working Group recently used a Dementia Engagement and
 Empowerment Grant to purchase iPads. These will help individuals with
 dementia connect with each other, particularly in group meetings, where
 some members may live far away and not be able to travel.
</p>
<p> 
 Simplified interfaces on tablet computers and mobile devices are also
 helping to increase technology use in older people with dementia, Neil
 said, as are easy-to-use communication apps like FaceTime and Skype.
</p>
<p> 
 Websites like Dementia Circle (available at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2i">http://eab.li/2i</a>
 ) also test and list devices that can assist everyday living for people with
 dementia.
</p>
<p> 
 RNIB Scotland’s move to sign the Technology Charter supports a
 long-established partnership with Alzheimer Scotland. The two organisations
 have previously worked together on similar projects, writing a best
 practice document on how various technologies can support people living
 with both sight loss and dementia.
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, digital skills organisation Tinder Foundation recently
 released a separate report, ‘Dementia and Digital’, based on research
 around a similar subject. Key findings of that report include the
 following: tablet computers are the most effective devices for delivering
 digital skills and health training for people with dementia; and, access to
 online resources increases wellbeing and confidence for people living with
 dementia.

<h3 id="i182-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Accessibility without the excessive price:</h3>
<p>  affordable tech site launched.
</p>
<p> 
 A new online resource has been launched to help people make informed
 choices about low-cost accessible technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The Affordable Access project (found at the link below:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2o">http://eab.li/2o</a>
 ) provides easy-to-understand information on a wide range of products and
 devices, all for under 250 Australian Dollars (equivalent to around &pound;150 /
 190 US Dollars). Technology covered on the site includes: tablet computers,
 smartphones, apps, desktop computers and TV streaming devices.
</p>
<p> 
 Affordable Access was launched by non-profit digital accessibility
 organisation Media Access Australia (found at the link below:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2s">http://eab.li/2s</a>
 ) in collaboration with the Australian Communications Consumer Action
 Network.
</p>
<p> 
 Four main areas of the site cover the following areas: common accessibility
 features; differing access needs and disabilities; information on available
 products; and a section for those with more advanced technological
 knowledge.
</p>
<p> 
 The section on common features includes a list of recommended accessibility
 software and apps (both built-in and third-party products) that work on
 different operating systems. This includes screen-readers, voice
 recognition software, magnifiers and Braille apps, all priced under $250.
</p>
<p> 
 Also included is a breakdown of accessibility features in different
 versions of Android and Windows, both chosen because of their pricing. The
 breakdown table also advises on how to enable these features and what kinds
 of users they will benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 While some specific information on Affordable Access is geared towards
 purchasing products in Australia, much of the content covers a wide range
 of globally available technologies. The advice and recommendations are
 applicable to anyone with an interest in accessible technology,
 particularly those who are new to the subject or unsure of what device will
 suit them.

<h3 id="i182-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Nurturing Conversation:</h3>
<p>  A new, free service enabling people who are deaf or hearing impaired to make video calls via an interpreter has
 launched in Canada. SRV Canada VRS aims to improve communication between
 people who are hearing impaired and those who can hear. When a hearing
 impaired person makes an online video call using the service, an
 interpreter appears on the device screen. The interpreter speaks the
 hearing impaired caller’s sign language to the non-hearing impaired
 caller, and then translates the vocal response back into sign language for
 the hearing impaired caller.

<p>  Thomas Bryan gets in touch from New Zealand, where he works for the Blind Foundation, an organisation that provides
 support and services for people with sight loss (find out more at the
 following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2-">http://eab.li/2-</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Thomas works with developers and manufacturers, looking at how emerging
 technologies can improve access to information and the environment for
 people with sight loss. He wants to know how museums and art galleries can
 use technology to improve the visiting experience:
</p>
<p> 
 “Can anyone point me towards information on equipment and services that
 will enhance tours and exhibitions, to make them more accessible and
 interactive for disabled visitors? I’d like to know about any technology
 that might help – navigation tools, virtual reality devices, or just
 anything that makes visiting a museum or gallery a better experience for
 people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “Also, I’d like to know how museums and galleries can make exhibition
 information on their websites more accessible and interesting for disabled
 users – especially anything that goes beyond just following standard web
 content guidelines.”

Section Three: Q &amp; A.
- James Buller, Home Office Digital.

</p>
<p>  opening up online services.</p>
<p> 
 James Buller is a user-researcher at Home Office Digital (HOD) leading on
 access needs, and has been contributing to the Government Digital Service
 (GDS) accessibility blog on GOV.UK, the UK government services portal.
</p>
<p> 
 Below is a republished, adapted version of the Q&amp;A in James’ GOV.UK post
 (with some additional material), explaining how he works with service users
 to meet accessibility requirements, as well as his own use of assistive
 technology and the wider work of HOD.
</p>
<p> 
 James’ original post can be found in full on the GDS accessibility blog,
 linked to at the end of this article.
</p>
<p> 
 - Please tell us about yourself:
</p>
<p> 
 “I’m a user-researcher at Home Office Digital. I talk to and observe
 users of our services to understand their needs. I relay these to my team
 to improve our provision. I’m also thrilled to be leading HOD on access
 needs alongside Emily Ball, raising peers and senior colleagues’
 awareness, skills and standards of accessibility, plus sharing good
 practice across government.
</p>
<p> 
 “Outside of work, I’m a trustee for Aniridia Network UK (found at the
 following link: https://aniridia.org.uk ),
 the charity that supports people with my rare genetic eye condition. I
 manage all aspects of its communications, IT and membership.
</p>
<p> 
 “Aniridia means my eyes didn’t develop properly as a baby. Most
 obviously, I have no irises – no coloured part of my eyes. That means I
 can’t shut out sun or bright light. It also means I can’t see detail
 and am very short-sighted. Essentially, I see everything over-exposed and
 in low resolution.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What visual aids do you use?
</p>
<p> 
 “Various magnifying glasses, sometimes including the camera and an app on
 my phone. To see things like presentations, I use a monocular. It’s a
 mini-telescope capable of focusing very nearby. This is useful when a
 colleague wants to show me something on their computer screen a few feet
 away. When outside, rather than sunglasses, I wear special green-tinted eye
 shields to cut out blue glaring light, without affecting contrast too
 much.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What assistive technology do you use when you’re on the web?
</p>
<p> 
 “Since my job is about usability of website interfaces, I avoid
 overriding their designs, such as with high contrast colours or larger
 fonts. So I use screen magnification software set to at least 200%, often
 more. At my desk, the screen view is spread across two monitors so that
 (most of) a line of text can be read with just head movement, rather than
 horizontal scrolling.
</p>
<p> 
 “That’s not possible with my Android phablet, but the large screen
 makes interfaces like the keyboards appear large. Plus, even with large
 fonts or zoom, a decent amount of stuff is still in view.
</p>
<p> 
 “I keep up with blogs using RSS feeds and listen to blog posts during my
 commute. The pronunciations can be fun. For example: ‘Now read live
 reporting from GDS’ could sound like: ‘now red liv reporting from
 geedesh.’
</p>
<p> 
 “Podcasts and videos are great alternatives to articles. Particularly for
 tutorials – I’ll seek out an audio-visual tutorial rather than a
 written guide.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What barriers do you regularly face on the web and in other parts of your
 job?
</p>
<p> 
 “Reading written materials or filling in paper forms is hard. Beyond the
 obvious, examples include: labels on sandwiches inside a glass counter; a
 reception desk sign-in sheet; art gallery labels; colleagues’ notes. As
 well as being hard to see, there are physical barriers or social
 expectations that inhibit my methods of perceiving them.
</p>
<p> 
 “Online, when using screen magnification, the biggest difficulties are
 due to notifications, dialog boxes or buttons being out of my current
 zoomed field of view. I have to physically scroll around, hunting for the
 interface I need. That is disorientating, takes valuable time and lots of
 mouse movement effort, which could lead to repetitive strain injury.
</p>
<p> 
 “Applications with text that cannot be enlarged are a pain. I can use the
 Android zoom, but then I have to swipe back and forth to read lines of
 text. To avoid that, I’ve become good at reading the first three-quarters
 of each line and guessing the rest, only swiping across when necessary.
</p>
<p> 
 “I’ll often give up reading rather than excessively scrolling my zoomed
 view back and forth. Text that poorly contrasts with the background is also
 a big hindrance.
</p>
<p> 
 “Also, ‘mega-menus’ can be a nightmare. I’m constantly moving my
 mouse to the edge of the screen to move the area I’m zoomed into. I
 frequently open menus by accident as the cursor passes over the area that
 activates them.
</p>
<p> 
 “All that said, I far prefer electronic to paper in most situations.
 I’d much rather write or fill in a well-designed online form with a
 keyboard and monitor, rather than paper and pen.”
</p>
<p> 
 - (e-Access Bulletin Editor’s note: the following two questions and
 answers are from separate material sent by James to e-Access Bulletin, and
 are not included in the original GOV.UK blog post republished above)
</p>
<p> 
 - Tell us a bit more about your role at Home Office Digital and the wider
 accessibility team:
</p>
<p> 
 “I’m now dedicated to leading on access needs full-time, and other
 staff are coming on board to assist. The focus on accessibility within the
 Home Office Digital team has been driven by Katy Arnold, Head of User
 Research and Design. Everyone on her team received training on how to
 discover and meet the access needs of colleagues and service users. We then
 found 12 enthusiastic people from among the researchers, writers and
 designers, and paired them up to specialise on a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 “They are tasked with growing our knowledge of how different disabilities
 may affect use of our online services and what can be done to help. This
 can then be fed into the design. The results of this are epitomised in the
 ‘Do and Don’t’ series of ‘designing for accessibility’ posters we
 produced (link below to GDS blog about the posters:
 <a href="http://eab.li/2n">http://eab.li/2n</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 “Three developers have also been given responsibility for improving how
 we address technical aspects.
</p>
<p> 
 “Before we even start planning a project, let alone coding it,
 user-researchers interview relevant people with access needs. We learn how
 to make the service meet their needs. Then throughout development, we run
 usability testing sessions, often visiting their home or workplace to
 observe them using our system with their assistive technology, in their
 normal environment.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How has this approach changed ways of working?
</p>
<p> 
 “Here are two examples of how online forms have changed:
</p>
<p> 
 “1: When asking for a phone number, enabling users (especially D/deaf
 users) to specify that we should only text them instead of calling [over
 the phone].
 2: When uploading a photograph for a passport, providing a way for users
 (such as, people with facial disfigurements) to override the automated
 checks for compliance with the rules, and explain why to the human
 examiner.
</p>
<p> 
 “I’m supporting all this work by giving advice, delivering training and
 conducting site audits. Together with the fantastic accessibility team at
 Government Digital Service and colleagues across government, we are
 continuing to grow our capacity for understanding and meeting access needs.
 I am thrilled to be part of the movement that’s creating exceptional
 services for everyone.”
