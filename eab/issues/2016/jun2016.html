<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Crowdsourcing Site Aims To Be World Leader For Venue Accessibilitydata.
</h3>
<p> 
 A new online platform built around user ratings and feedback is aiming to
 become “the world’s leading provider of accessible venue
 information,” according to the site’s developer.
</p>
<p> 
 The Access Earth site is about to launch in full after ten months of public
 testing in beta stage, with a mobile app to follow soon.
</p>
<p> 
 The platform allows users to give scores and leave comments about the
 accessibility of hotels, restaurants and other locations around the world.
 This information is then available to other users.
</p>
<p> 
 The platform was developed in 2012, after Matt McCann – who has cerebral
 palsy – had booked a hotel describing itself online as ‘wheelchair
 accessible’. On arrival, McCann found steps to the entrance and rooms too
 small for his rollator mobility aid, sparking both frustration and a desire
 to help prevent these situations for others.
</p>
<p> 
 McCann told e-Access Bulletin: “I knew that being a software engineer I
 could do something about this lack of specific accessibility
 information.”
</p>
<p> 
 The site’s database of venues across the globe is currently split into
 four categories, covering places to eat and drink, places to sleep,
 shopping, and things to do. Users select a venue type and where around the
 world they want to search, before specifying accessibility criteria, such
 as step-free access, ground floor rooms, and accessible bathrooms.
</p>
<p> 
 Anyone can supply a venue accessibility rating, either by answering Access
 Earth’s ‘accessibility criteria’ or leaving a note: “This could be
 something like ‘the elevator is currently out of order’, or directions
 to the accessible bathrooms,” McCann said. “By keeping the access
 information up-to-date, we can ensure people have the most accurate
 information available to them.”
</p>
<p> 
 Users can also add and rate a new venue if it isn’t already on the
 database, as well as sharing information and tips with other users.
</p>
<p> 
 The full Access Earth site will allow users to personalise their searches
 based on their own individual accessibility criteria. Different profiles
 for different access needs can also be created, McCann said: “For
 example, someone may need only step-free access when on their own, but they
 might also want an accessible bathroom when with a friend. Users can now
 switch between those different profiles.”
</p>
<p> 
 An Access Earth app, scheduled for the end of August, will allow users to
 easily leave accessibility feedback about locations from a mobile device.
</p>
<p> 
 Access Earth is one of a number of new and existing platforms that provide
 crowdsourced location access information, including Johnny’s Pass,
 Euan’s Guide (read our interview with the founder of Euan’s Guide at
 the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/1l">http://eab.li/1l</a>
 ) and Wheelmap. In March, one of Wheelmap’s developers, Holger Dieterich, told e-Access Bulletin that his
 goal was to share the site’s user-data with other location-based
 services, so that more people can use it.
</p>
<p> 
 McCann is also keen to explore the idea of information-sharing for Access
 Earth in the longer-term. “Collaboration is definitely something that we
 would look to try and do in the future,” he said. “It’s great that
 there are other people out there tackling this problem, it just shows that
 this is a worldwide issue that needs to be addressed.”

<h3 id="i180-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Social Networking Through Voice Rather Than Vision.</h3>
<p> 
 A free communication app based on voice messages is proving popular with
 blind and visually impaired users, and has launched a Kickstarter
 crowdfunding campaign to help expand its community.
</p>
<p> 
 Users of the Vorail app communicate by recording questions or thoughts as
 short voice messages, which are available for other users to listen to and
 reply. Users just need to set up a basic profile, without any photos or
 images.
</p>
<p> 
 One of Vorail’s co-founders, Tom Rosenthal, told e-Access Bulletin that
 although the app wasn’t designed specifically for blind and visually
 impaired people, most users are from these groups. As a result, the team
 behind the app now dedicate resources to making sure it is accessible.
 Rosenthal said: “Vorail was designed to create a safer place where we can
 see the true nature of others … There’s much more to a person than a
 photo or what is revealed in text messages. That’s why we developed
 Vorail – the voice is a window to the soul.”
</p>
<p> 
 Around 80,000 questions a day are asked on the app, covering a huge range
 of topics. Subjects discussed include: Braille and guide dogs; personal
 reflections on blindness; requests for relationship advice; and thoughts on
 anything from favourite foods to nightclubs.
</p>
<p> 
 Some Vorail members use the app for dating, but it is also widely used to
 meet new friends or simply connect with others. The user-community features
 people who are married, engaged, dating, single and even families,
 Rosenthal said. The first Vorail marriage is taking place soon, between two
 people who met using the app, one from the UK, the other from the United
 States.
</p>
<p> 
 Rosenthal said that while social media platforms like Facebook and Snapchat
 are useful for networking with existing friends, Vorail allows its
 community to meet new people easily. Similarly, while popular meeting and
 dating sites are based around users’ photos, “Vorail was designed for
 people that want to see beyond the picture … Technology can do better at
 helping us find people who we share chemistry with,” Rosenthal said.
</p>
<p> 
 Vorail went live at the end of 2015 on Apple’s iOS operating system, and
 recently launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to gauge public
 interest in expanding to the Android operating system as well.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Tactile Braille Tablet Brings Pictures And Content To Life Over 14lines.
</h3>
<p> 
 A Braille tablet computer, thought to be the first of its kind available to
 the public, is about to be launched with a series of potentially
 game-changing features.
</p>
<p> 
 BLITAB is a tactile tablet computer designed for blind and visually
 impaired users, claimed to be the first such tablet by its developers. The
 design features a page of Braille over 14 lines, plus a smaller
 touch-screen below. Through the touch-screen, which has voice-navigation,
 users access the internet, email, documents and other content, which is
 then converted into Braille above. This includes pictures, graphics, maps
 and other images, which can all be represented on the Braille display.
</p>
<p> 
 The Braille is formed through a liquid-based system that creates small
 bubbles, which raise and fall on the page. BLITAB’s 14 lines of Braille
 presents an advantage over many standard Braille readers, which usually
 feature one single line for text.
</p>
<p> 
 The device was developed by BLITAB Technology, a Bulgarian start-up company
 now based in Austria. Kristina Tsvetanova, co-founder and CEO, had the idea
 for BLITAB after a blind student at a Bulgarian university (where
 Tsvetanova was studying industrial engineering) asked for her help to
 register for classes online.
</p>
<p> 
 “I did some research, and realised that the technology boom over the past
 few years had not benefited everyone,” Tsvetanova told e-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 User-testing with visually impaired and blind participants helped shape
 BLITAB’s development, and all standard features found on other tablet
 computers (such as Wi-Fi, USB slots, Bluetooth and text-to-speech) are
 available.
</p>
<p> 
 As reported in e-Access Bulletin’s March edition, BLITAB has received
 funding from the Google Impact Challenge project. It was then demonstrated
 at an event in Brussels earlier this year, which showcased accessible
 technology that helps independent living.
</p>
<p> 
 BLITAB will be launched in beta (testing stage) at a mobile technology
 conference, Mobile World Congress Shanghai, at the beginning of July. It
 will be available for public purchase soon after that, said Tsvetanova, and
 will cost €2,500 – a price similar to or cheaper than many full-size
 refreshable Braille displays currently on the market.
</p>
<p> 
 Tsvetanova also wants BLITAB to help blind individuals in developing
 countries and low-income communities, with the device acting as a literacy
 aid, both for children in school and adults seeking employment. BLITAB can
 be “a tool and platform that engenders confidence and knowledge of the
 world, which is crucial for better quality of social life,” she said.

<p>  Alan Philpott gets in touch to reply to a comment in last month’s e-Access Bulletin. In that issue, Clive Lever wondered
 why digital product accessibility doesn’t seem to feature in the training
 received by retail staff who sell these products. Here are Alan’s
 thoughts:
</p>
<p> 
 “For the most part, I don’t believe that the product training staff
 receive in most stores in the UK is adequate – and not just in the field
 Clive mentions. Everyone is affected by the poor service in shops (in terms
 of knowledge) that occurs, but this problem, which can be overcome by
 sighted people more easily, is very hard to deal with for blind and other
 vision-impaired people, through mobility restrictions. This may make it
 difficult to go to different shops before making a purchase, during which
 time they might be able to find out the answers they need from one of the
 ten or so shop assistants they encounter on their travels.
</p>
<p> 
 “For many blind and vision-impaired people, difficulties in accessing the
 internet also have an effect, and accessing computer training is also
 difficult, and may be very expensive and hard to come by when you are
 unemployed … IT skills can deteriorate, one falls behind, and the whole
 thing becomes a nightmare, as one struggles to find out the information
 which one should have been given in the stores one visited in the first
 place. Truly, a vicious circle in my view.”

Section Three: Q &amp; A.
- Katherine Payne, Wayfindr.

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Navigating Life’S Obstacles.</h3>
<p> 
 Audio navigation systems can be a useful tool to help blind and visually
 impaired people become more independent and mobile, particularly when used
 in an app.
</p>
<p> 
 The Wayfindr project has just unveiled a valuable contribution to the field
 by releasing the first ‘open standard’ for audio navigation. The
 standard features detailed guidelines to help developers, transport
 services and building owners create digital navigation systems that can be
 used by blind and visually impaired people.
</p>
<p> 
 Last year, Wayfindr organised a trial in London’s Eutson Tube Station,
 featuring blind and visually impaired participants navigating the station
 through a demo mobile app. The app spoke directions out loud to the users,
 triggered by Bluetooth ‘beacons’ around the station. With the trial
 successful and the open standard released, it seems like there’s big
 potential for Wayfindr to make a real difference.
</p>
<p> 
 e-Access Bulletin spoke to one of the Wayfindr team, Katherine Payne, to
 find out more.
</p>
<p> 
 - How did the idea for Wayfindr come about?
</p>
<p> 
 “In 2014 the Royal London Society for Blind People’s Youth Forum
 released their youth manifesto, which detailed the challenges they faced as
 blind young Londoners. One of the main challenges was transport. They
 wanted to navigate the London Underground transport system independently.
 Working with digital product studio ustwo, the Youth Forum investigated how
 mainstream technology could support this. Using Bluetooth low energy
 beacons and smartphones, we have developed a system of audio-based
 navigation.”
</p>
<p> 
 - How does Wayfindr work?
</p>
<p> 
 “Emerging indoor navigation technologies, such as Bluetooth low energy
 beacons, hold the key to opening up the world for vision-impaired people.
 However, in order to achieve the greatest impact globally, there is a
 pressing need to develop a consistent standard to be used across wayfinding
 systems. This will truly open up a world where vision-impaired people are
 no longer held back by their sight loss, removing barriers to employment,
 to seeing friends and family, and engaging in their community.
</p>
<p> 
 “The Wayfindr Open Standard aims to do just that. It gives venue owners
 and digital navigation service providers the tools to implement high
 quality, consistent audio wayfinding solutions. It also includes an
 open-source demo app that enables people who download it to use Bluetooth
 beacons, to understand and implement the open standard with real users, in
 real contexts, in real time.”
</p>
<p> 
 - Who is the standard aimed at and where might it be used?
</p>
<p> 
 “The aim is that this open standard will help lower the barrier for
 built-environment owners and digital navigation services to make their
 environments, products and services inclusive from the outset, as we
 continue to weave technology into our cities.
</p>
<p> 
 “We hope it will be used across transport networks and digital navigation
 services, including places like Tranport For London and the CityMapper
 transport app.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What kind of research helped produce the standard?
</p>
<p> 
 “Various resources informed the content of the standard, which is still a
 first-version working draft. These resources include user-research from
 trials of London Pimlico Underground Station, Sydney Town Hall Train
 Station and London Euston Underground Station. Academic research supports
 the findings from these trials.
</p>
<p> 
 “Additionally, factual information about vision-impairment and the
 navigation techniques of vision impaired people was used, plus input and
 feedback from industry experts.”
</p>
<p> 
 - What applications does the Wayfindr open standard have for blind and
 visually impaired people?
</p>
<p> 
 “Eventually it will be other trains, and not just the London Underground,
 that vision-impaired people will be able to navigate on their own. It could
 then be expanded to city level, to restaurants and to shops. Ruksana, a
 member of the Royal London Society for Blind People’s Youth Forum, made
 the following comment about these ideas: ‘That would be really
 revolutionary, it would change our lives. We wouldn’t need any assistance
 to get anywhere.’”
</p>
<p> 
 - How do you hope to develop Wayfindr in the future?
</p>
<p> 
 “We want to see audio wayfinding solutions across the world – in
 transport networks, shopping centres, hospitals and other places. We
 can’t do this alone. We need the Wayfindr community to keep sharing their
 knowledge, expertise and experience, to strengthen the standard and
 implement accessible navigation solutions globally.”
