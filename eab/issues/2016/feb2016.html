<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Welcome Back To E-Access Bulletin.As Many Readers Will Now Know, The Bulletin Has Been On Hiatus Since
Mid-2015. Initially This Was Due To Publishing Logistics, But Later That
Year, Dan Jellinek, E-Access Bulletin’S Founder And Editor, Passed Away
Suddenly And Unexpectedly. This Was, And Continues To Be, A Horrific Shock
For Everyone Who Knew Dan And The Countless People Who Appreciated His
Work.
</h3>
<p> 
 Dan was a wonderful, talented, kind individual, who was passionate about
 the issues he believed in, as readers of e-Access Bulletin will know.
 Though he worked successfully in many areas, he was also a superb
 journalist and editor, and contributed a great deal to digital
 accessibility at a time when coverage of the sector was still in its
 infancy.
</p>
<p> 
 Deciding to continue the bulletin without Dan was not an easy task. His
 knowledge, abilities and creative flair were present in every issue, and
 the thought of continuing the bulletin without him is, frankly, an
 intimidating one, as well as incredibly sad on a personal level for me. I
 always saw Dan as a friend, as well as a colleague and my editor for a
 number of years.
</p>
<p> 
 E-Access Bulletin was and always will be Dan’s publication. He poured so
 much thought, care and energy into it, and worked extremely hard to keep it
 going since its launch in 2000. He did all this because he knew how useful
 the bulletin was to people in informing them about accessibility issues. I
 can only hope to continue keeping readers informed about those issues, and
 hopefully pay tribute to Dan’s great work along the way.
</p>
<p> 
 Thanks to the following people for their help and support in relaunching
 the bulletin: Gillian Fraser, Roger Clifton, Thomas Pocklington Trust,
 Derek Parkinson, John Neame, Kevin Carey, and in particular, Jake Jellinek.
 Without Jake’s technical expertise, patience and invaluable assistance at
 every turn, it simply wouldn’t have been possible to publish the bulletin
 again. Thanks also to all those readers who have already expressed their
 support for the bulletin and sadness at the awful news about Dan.
</p>
<p> 
 The next issue of e-Access Bulletin will feature a special tribute to Dan
 and his work in the e-accessibility sector, with contributions from those
 who knew and worked with him.
</p>
<p> 
 In the meantime, I hope you enjoy reading e-Access Bulletin again.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="i176-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Survey Puts A Price On Frustrated Shoppers ‘Clicking Away’.</h3>
<p> 
 Widespread research will find out how much money UK businesses are losing
 by failing to make their websites accessible to users with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The Click-Away Pound survey (CAP) asks internet users with disabilities
 about their online shopping experiences across a range of sectors,
 including banking, supermarkets and travel. Rick Williams, managing
 director of disability consultancy Freeney Williams, came up with the idea
 after 15 years of assessing and auditing poorly designed websites through
 his work.
</p>
<p> 
 Williams was inspired to create CAP by the Business Disability Forum’s
 Walkaway Pound Report (link to report: <a href="http://bit.ly/1PL9p8c">http://bit.ly/1PL9p8c</a>
 ) in 2015, which found that over 75% of people with disabilities had left a shop or
 business because of its poor awareness of disability. He wanted to find out
 if these negative shopping experiences were mirrored online.
</p>
<p> 
 The CAP survey was co-designed by Williams and Steve Brownlow of ICT
 accessibility company Frabjous Day Ltd, and is being supported by a number
 of organisations, including the Business Disability Forum, Business
 Disability International and the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB).
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to e-Access Bulletin, Williams claimed that over 70% of websites
 his company has assessed have a “significant” commercial and legal risk
 due to inaccessibility. Williams said: “There is a law, of course [the
 Equality Act 2010], but 20 years of legislation hasn’t really made much
 of an impact.”
</p>
<p> 
 Williams also explained his motivation for creating the CAP survey:
 “Businesses need to understand that they ignore disabled shoppers at the
 risk of their bottom line, and those who do make their websites accessible
 will get the business. If we can demonstrate to businesses the lost
 opportunities in hard cash, then maybe they will feel more inclined to
 change.”
</p>
<p> 
 Purchasing goods and services online can be a notoriously difficult
 experience for shoppers with disabilities, particularly when using
 assistive technology such as screen-readers. The transactional sections of
 many websites are often not designed to accommodate this technology,
 meaning that users can find it difficult or impossible to complete a
 purchase through these sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Initial research by Freeney Williams before launching the survey found that
 over 70% of disabled people regularly encounter inaccessible websites. The
 common reaction was to simply ‘click away’ and find a more
 user-friendly site, the research shows.
</p>
<p> 
 A closing date for the Click-Away Pound survey hasn’t yet been decided,
 as Williams is keen to gather as many submissions as possible, but results
 will eventually be published a few months after CAP closes.
</p>
<p> 
 Williams encourages any online users with disabilities to complete the
 survey, which is open now and can be found at the links to the Click-Away
 Pound website below. Results are anonymous and it takes around ten minutes
 to complete.

<h3 id="i176-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Video Gaming Charity Expands Its Reach By Delivering Bonus Packs.</h3>
<p> 
 A gaming charity has begun giving out ‘Expansion Packs’ containing
 assistive technology and video games to specialist care homes and
 organisations working with individuals with disabilities around the United
 States.
</p>
<p> 
 The AbleGamers Foundation gives video game fans with disabilities the
 chance to play games and connect with others, through what it claims is the
 largest community for gamers with disabilities in the world. The Expansion
 Packs project is a way of providing games and assistive equipment on a
 larger scale, says the charity.
</p>
<p> 
 Launched in 2004, AbleGamers has been working with large companies from the
 gaming industry (including Electronic Arts and SteelSeries) to create the
 packs for distribution across the US. The packs will be tailored to suit
 the needs of individuals at each organisation, and AbleGamers will train
 staff at each location to set up the gaming equipment and assistive
 technology. A ‘troubleshooting’ service will also be offered to solve
 any issues after the set-up.
</p>
<p> 
 The first Expansion Pack was given to Pediatric Speciality Care in
 Pennsylvania, which offers long-term care for children with disabilities.
 The second pack will be given to a centre in Boston.
</p>
<p> 
 AbleGamers also offers resources and advice. The charity has produced
 guidelines for developers on designing accessible video games, and it also
 supplies assistive technology grants for gamers with disabilities. An
 upcoming portal on the AbleGamers website will provide information for
 those caring for someone with a disability, advising on suitable games and
 the assistive technology needed to play them.

<h3 id="i176-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Uk-Wide Digital Champions Network Launches, Backed By £2 Million.</h3>
<p> 
 Home-based digital skills training will be given to elderly people and
 those with disabilities in a newly launched project.
</p>
<p> 
 One Digital is a UK initiative to improve digital literacy around the
 country, led by a consortium of six charities and training organisations,
 funded through &pound;2 million from grant-giving organisation the Big Lottery
 Fund. These partner organisations will work on separate projects, but all
 will be involved with training digital champions to pass on their skills.
</p>
<p> 
 After plans for the scheme were announced in September last year, One
 Digital was launched in Edinburgh earlier this month, and its work is now
 underway.
</p>
<p> 
 One strand of the funding has gone to skills organisation Digital Unite.
 Assistive technology charity AbilityNet and housing association Affinity
 Sutton will work in partnership with Digital Unite to build a network of
 digital champions.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet will support volunteers in becoming champions, who will then
 provide help to approximately 1,000 digitally excluded elderly and disabled
 people in their homes. Skills being passed on will include sending emails,
 using search engines, and online shopping and banking.
</p>
<p> 
 Other members of the One Digital consortium include Age UK, Citizens Online
 and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO).
</p>
<p> 
 In a blog post celebrating the launch, programme director and chief
 executive of Digital Unite, Emma Weston, wrote: “One Digital is really
 profoundly different from digital skills projects that have gone before
 it”. Weston went on to highlight the crucial role that digital champions
 will play in the project, connecting with some of the 12 million people
 around the UK who do not use the internet.
</p>
<p> 
 There will also be a One Digital ‘support network’ with resources to
 help the digital champions in their work. The aim is for the project to
 recruit and train a total of 1,400 digital champions during 2016, who will
 then work with 9,500 digitally excluded people. Read more about One Digital

<p>  The European Blind Union (EBU) is campaigning for a proposed European Parliament directive on website accessibility to be more

Section Three: Special report:
- How accessible is WordPress?

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Pressing Issues.By Graham Armfield.
</h3>
<p> 
 WordPress is the world's most popular content management system (CMS). It
 now powers over 20% of the world's websites, and that figure is steadily
 rising. People choose WordPress for its flexibility as a web platform, and
 because it can be used to create a stylish website extremely quickly, using
 freely available themes (or templates) and plugins. But how accessible are
 the websites produced with WordPress and the admin screens used to manage
 those sites?
</p>
<p> 
 WordPress is a true open source project. It has been created and amended
 over ten years by literally hundreds of developers. Sadly, many of these
 developers had little or no knowledge or experience of accessibility,
 meaning that many inaccessible practices were baked into WordPress themes,
 plugins and admin screens.
</p>
<p> 
 - Admin screens and accessibility.
 In 2011, accessibility of the WordPress admin screens was pretty dire and
 many of the screens were unusable to anyone relying on assistive technology
 or keyboard interaction. Isolated accessibility initiatives had previously
 been undertaken, but they weren't always easy to find.
</p>
<p> 
 Since then, however, the Make WordPress Accessible Team (MWAT) has made a
 significant difference. MWAT is a small group of volunteers committed to
 improving accessibility. The situation is now a lot better, thanks to MWAT
 talking about accessibility at WordPress meetups, raising bug tickets, and
 in some cases, actually submitting improved code.
</p>
<p> 
 Now, all new functionality introduced into the admin area goes through an
 accessibility review by MWAT volunteers. Existing inaccessible components
 like the Media Library and Theme Customizer have also been vastly improved.
</p>
<p> 
 However, amending or adding new pages or blog posts can still be a little
 fraught for screen-reader users. Keyboard shortcuts do exist to speed up
 editing and formatting of pages and blog posts, but they are not readily
 advertised.
</p>
<p> 
 - Themes and accessibility.
 WordPress themes provide the template for the parts of a WordPress website
 that the world sees. Off-the-shelf themes are freely available, and any PHP
 developer can easily create a bespoke theme for a business or charity.
</p>
<p> 
 Thanks to the Make WordPress Accessible Team, there is now an extra,
 optional, accessibility audit built into the theme review process. So when
 theme developers submit their themes to WordPress, they can apply for an
 'accessibility-ready' tag. People searching for an accessible off-the-peg
 theme can use this tag to narrow their search. In October 2015 there were
 69 free themes that carried this tag.
</p>
<p> 
 That may not sound like many, but it is significant considering there are
 currently over 3,000 themes available from WordPress. Three recent default
 themes also have a high level of accessibility, and it is hoped that one
 day this accessibility audit will be included in the review of all new
 themes.
</p>
<p> 
 Because of past accessibility reviews, there is now nothing in the
 WordPress core functionality that will prevent the development of a fully
 accessible website – assuming that an accessibility-ready theme or an
 accessible bespoke theme is chosen.
</p>
<p> 
 - Accessibility of WordPress plugins.
 Plugins provide useful or desirable extra functionality for websites, such
 as spam blocking, SEO (search engine optimisation), Twitter feeds, contact
 forms, lightboxes and carousels. While some areas within WordPress are
 moving in the right direction, the situation around plugins isn't.
</p>
<p> 
 Like themes, plugins can be submitted by anyone, and although each plugin
 also goes through a review process, there is no accessibility aspect to
 that review. Sadly, that means that many plugins can and do compromise the
 accessibility of a WordPress website, even if an accessible theme is being
 used and the content authors know their stuff when it comes to
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Issues here include: contact form generators where labels are not linked to
 input fields; lightbox plugins where keyboard interaction is not possible
 and where focus management is poor; and carousels that break with keyboard
 interaction or with movement that can't be stopped.
</p>
<p> 
 - How can the situation improve?
 As mentioned above, the Make WordPress Accessible Team is small, and all
 members fit their WordPress accessibility work around other paid
 assignments. The team needs more people to take part in regular
 accessibility testing sessions, and to transform results into bug tickets
 for developers to fix.
</p>
<p> 
 Each new version of WordPress contains new accessible functionality and
 various accessibility fixes – there just needs to be more emphasis on it
 to increase the rate of change.
