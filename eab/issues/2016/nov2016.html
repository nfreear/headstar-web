<h3 id="i184-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Assistive Technology Industry Must Address Challenges, Warns Expert.</h3>
<p> 
 Poor levels of website accessibility, financial issues and pressure to
 integrate with mainstream technology are some of the challenges facing the
 assistive technology (AT) industry, according to the Executive Director of
 the British Assistive Technology Association (BATA).
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the second Assistive Technology Exhibition and Conference
 (ATEC), held in Sheffield, UK, BATA’s Executive Director, John Lamb, said
 that the industry must face and address nine key issues to succeed.
</p>
<p> 
 Lamb began by telling delegates at his session – ‘The challenges facing
 AT’ – that the overarching, crucial function that AT needs to perform
 at all times is to effectively meet the needs of users with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 While the spending power of &pound;212 billion a year from more than ten million
 disabled people in the UK gives the AT industry a strong imperative to meet
 those specific needs, 65% of those people with disabilities are over 65,
 and therefore twice as likely to be unemployed, said Lamb. “Given that
 older demographic, it’s really important that the technology is
 user-friendly and that it’s affordable,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Achieving this affordability has been difficult, he continued, due to AT
 products and software being sold in small quantities, and a shortage of
 people with the skills to develop specialist assistive software.
</p>
<p> 
 Another key challenge facing the industry is awareness, Lamb said. “There
 is a low level of awareness of assistive technology, and also a lack of
 understanding of exactly what it’s capable of and – just as importantly
 – what it’s not capable of. It’s very important that people’s
 expectations of technology are managed.”
</p>
<p> 
 There is also increasing pressure on the AT industry to integrate products
 with mainstream services, Lamb said. He then used the BrailleNote Touch as
 an example. The BrailleNote is a refreshable Braille device, powered by the
 Android operating system and developed by visual impairment AT company
 HumanWare and Google, demonstrating how specialist AT is beginning to
 combine with mainstream technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Website accessibility remains a significant problem for the AT sector, Lamb
 said, and although there has been a general improvement across Europe,
 there is “still a huge job to be done.” He cited various website
 accessibility issues, including a lack of ‘alt text’, incorrectly
 titled frames and badly presented tables, as common problems in this area,
 “all of which are fixable.” Lamb said: “We do have the standards to
 guide people, so there’s not really an excuse. It’s crucial that the
 pressure is maintained on the owners of websites.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessibility Survey Reveals Pdf Problems, Technology Types Andsatisfied Users.
</h3>
<p> 
 The UK Government online services portal, GOV.UK, is aiming to cut down on
 PDFs after an accessibility survey revealed that many users encounter
 problems with them.
</p>
<p> 
 Launched in May, the GOV.UK 2016 assistive technology survey aimed to find
 out about the range of technologies that people are using to access and
 navigate the site. The survey received 712 responses from assistive
 technology users.
</p>
<p> 
 Results are now being published on the Government Digital Service (GDS)
 Accessibility Blog. Some of the key findings are highlighted below.
</p>
<p> 
 Screen magnifiers – used mainly by people with a visual impairment –
 are the most popular form of assistive technology accessing GOV.UK, used by
 30% of respondents. ZoomText is the most popular magnification software.
</p>
<p> 
 Screen-readers – again primarily used by people with sight loss – are
 also commonly used, by 29% of respondents. The most popular screen-reader
 software is JAWS.
</p>
<p> 
 Read and Write, a type of software aimed at users with dyslexia, was found
 to be the most commonly used ‘reading solution’.
</p>
<p> 
 The survey also revealed that many assistive technology users accessing
 GOV.UK found PDFs difficult to access and read, and would prefer content in
 HTML format – an issue that many accessible technology users will be
 familiar with.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the survey’s designers, Chris Moore – a content designer and
 digital accessibility champion at HMRC – told e-Access Bulletin that
 GOV.UK is aiming to lessen its reliance on PDFs as a result of the survey
 findings. “Many users just don’t like PDFs,” Moore said. “We’ve
 run workshops to identify why content producers prefer to use that format
 and to enable us to provide them with solutions, so they don’t have to
 continue publishing that way.”
</p>
<p> 
 Other issues uncovered in the results included that some users felt that
 search results pages on GOV.UK are too complicated. Also, some users found
 the site’s use of black text on a white background difficult to read.
</p>
<p> 
 However, as well as identifying accessibility barriers, the survey results
 also showed that a “significant number” of people are happy with
 GOV.UK’s level of accessibility, with some users being pleased at the
 simple design of the site.
</p>
<p> 
 “It looks like we are on the right track,” said Moore, “as quite a
 significant number of users told us that they find GOV.UK to be really
 accessible for them, so we will continue our efforts to make GOV.UK as
 simple as possible. We are using the survey results to help us decide which
 assistive technologies we will use to test GOV.UK and which assistive
 technologies we will advise other departments to test with.”
</p>
<p> 
 Other findings and results from the survey will be published on GOV.UK,
 including blogs about the range of assistive technologies that respondents
 are using, and the issues around PDF content. Moore said that another
 assistive technology survey will be launched in 2017, using the data from
 the current survey to compare against.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Tactile Technology Brings World-Famous Paintings To Life For Blindpeople.
</h3>
<p> 
 A special version of one of the world’s most well-known paintings has
 been created through 3D-printing, so that people with sight loss can
 experience it by touch.
</p>
<p> 
 The tactile, ‘3D relief’ version of Gustav Klimt’s ‘The Kiss’
 also features a series of audio triggers that explain different elements of
 the new work to visitors when they run their fingers over certain areas.
</p>
<p> 
 Housed in the Belvedere Museum in Vienna – the same museum that holds
 Klimt’s original ‘The Kiss’ – the 3D version has been developed
 through AMBAVis (Access to Museums for Blind and Visually Impaired People),
 a European Union-funded project that aims to improve the museum experience
 for blind and visually impaired visitors through 3D technology and
 “multi-sensory approaches”. ‘The Kiss’ is the seventh relief work
 developed through the project, with previous works housed in other museums
 around Europe.
</p>
<p> 
 The tactile version of ‘The Kiss’ sits in the Belvedere on a pedestal
 next to Klimt’s original, which was painted by the artist using oil paint
 mixed with gold leaf. Measuring 42 by 42 centimetres, the tactile version
 depicts the painting’s two figures – entwined and wearing colourful
 robes – entirely in white and with various features of the work available
 to explore by hand. For example, the robes feature intricate patterns that
 can be felt by touch.
</p>
<p> 
 Andreas Reichinger (who works in semantic modelling and acquisition at
 VRVis, a visual computing research institution in Austria) led many of the
 technical design aspects of the 3D version of ‘The Kiss’. Reichinger
 told e-Access Bulletin that the accessible cultural work of AMBAVis will be
 expanded in a new project, called ARCHES.
</p>
<p> 
 Reichinger said: “In ARCHES we will take things to the next level, and
 aim to include people not only with difficulties in vision, but with
 differences and difficulties associated with all kinds of perception,
 memory, cognition and communication.”
</p>
<p> 
 Six new relief works are planned for ARCHES, and each will be housed in a
 different participating museum, including two in London – the Victoria
 and Albert Museum and the Wallace Collection.
</p>
<p> 
 Both AMBAVis and ARCHES are funded through the Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020
 programs. AMBAVis has been running for two years and is partnered with a
 number of European organisations, including the VRVis Centre for Virtual
 Reality and Visualisation Research, and the Austrian and German Federations
 of the Blind and Visually Impaired.

 the emporiaSMART, a smartphone with a removable keypad that he found on the
 RNIB online shop. Anthony – who is blind and currently works as a
 voluntary consultant to the Sri Lanka Federation of the Visually
 Handicapped – is after some advice on the functions of the phone:
</p>
<p> 
 “I’d like to know if the emporiaSMART phone can easily be used by blind
 users, both with and without the removable keypad. As it uses the Android
 system, does it have the Android ‘TalkBack’ software designed for blind

Section Three: Special report.
- The Assistive Technology Exhibition and Conference.

</p>
<p>  evolving assistive technology.</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this month, the second ATEC (Assistive Technology Exhibition and
 Conference) event took place, held in Sheffield, UK. A wide range of
 figures from the assistive technology (AT) industry were in attendance,
 including e-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Here, we present an overview of some of the many thought-provoking seminars
 and workshops that took place throughout the day.
</p>
<p> 
 The opening conference keynote speech was delivered by Hector Minto, senior
 technology evangelist for accessibility at Microsoft. Minto explained that
 there is now mandatory accessibility training for all Microsoft employees,
 but said that looking at the wider employment picture in society, “It’s
 absolutely clear that most people don’t consider accessibility in their
 role.”
</p>
<p> 
 Microsoft and other influential organisations have a part to play in
 changing that, he said: “The role of Microsoft and the largest companies
 around the world is to demonstrate clear starting points for accessibility,
 as well as improving what we’re doing over time.”
</p>
<p> 
 Minto also claimed that we have become “technologically blasé” in
 recent years, meaning that accessibility products, services and functions
 aren’t always publicised or exposed as well as they should be. “We
 almost just expect these advances to come so thick and fast that we don’t
 stop to tell people about them,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Gareth Ford Williams, head of accessibility at the BBC, gave the second
 conference keynote speech. Williams began by pointing out that “we all
 have accessibility requirements,” before talking about how the BBC’s
 access services have evolved.
</p>
<p> 
 While early access services like subtitling and sign-interpreted content
 are still widely used, ‘future content’ will be delivered through
 formats such as multi-screen and 3D radio, meaning that new forms of access
 services are needed, Ford Williams said. For example, increased used of
 virtual reality (VR) presents challenges for subtitling, as traditional
 subtitling will not work in a VR environment. “Content is rapidly
 evolving and there is a need for AT that responds to this change,” said
 Ford Williams.
</p>
<p> 
 In some cases, the methods used in providing ‘future content’ can also
 assist in accessibility. Binaural recording, a technique used in 3D radio
 (which immerses users in audio content, meaning that they hear sound from
 all around them, as opposed to one source), is now being used by BBC teams
 to create an immersive VR experience, replicating aspects of how people
 with autism experience the world. This project is planned to be used as a
 training tool for managers at the BBC, to give them a more in-depth insight
 of the experiences of employees with autism.
</p>
<p> 
 John Lamb of the British Assistive Technology Association (BATA) and
 Ability Magazine delivered a session on the challenges facing the AT
 industry (see Section One: News, in this issue). He concluded by talking
 about new and emerging technologies that can benefit people with
 disabilities. These included 3D-printing, wearable technologies, driverless
 cars, robots and digital navigation aids such as the Wayfindr system –
 reported on in the June 2016 issue of e-Access Bulletin (read our Wayfindr
 Q&amp;A at the following link: <a href="http://eab.li/1t">http://eab.li/1t</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 David Banes, director of David Banes Access and Inclusion Services, hosted
 a fascinating seminar on ‘Accessible technology in an era of disruptive
 innovation’. Defined (in relation to technology) as something that
 displaces an established technology and produces dramatic, revolutionary
 change, disruptive innovation is already affecting the AT industry in a
 huge way, Banes said.
</p>
<p> 
 Commonly cited examples of disruptive technology models include transport
 service Uber and homestay accommodation network Airbnb. Both have shaken up
 their respective markets and both have been beneficial to users with
 disabilities, Banes said.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the most significant changes that disruptive innovation has brought
 to the AT market is a shift in traditional business models, said Banes:
 “There is increasing growth in free and low-cost solutions. These are now
 expected, and the market expectation of what people will pay has changed
 massively,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 To demonstrate this, Banes gave an example of his time working in Qatar,
 where he was CEO of the Qatar Assistive Technology and Accessibility
 Center: “I worked with blind people who told me that they could achieve
 90% of what they needed to do online every day, including work, using only
 their iPhone with VoiceOver. One person said: ‘I don’t know if I will
 ever buy a screen-reader again.’”
</p>
<p> 
 What is now important, said Banes, is how the AT industry responds to
 disruptive innovation. He gave three key steps that the industry needs to
 take in this respect: pay more attention to research from a wider range of
 sources; be willing to change traditional business models; and work to
 understand the broader, evolving needs of customers.
</p>
<p> 
 Banes said: “Many people with disabilities are beginning to see
 disruptive innovation as an opportunity, not a threat. This is a chance to
 get the things they want, at a price they can afford, at the time they want
 it. It’s going to bring short-term challenges for the AT industry, but it
 will have a huge impact.”
</p>
<p> 
 Some of these sentiments were echoed in ATEC’s closing Q&amp;A panel session.
 Lucy Ruck – manager of the Business Disability Forum’s Technology
 Taskforce – spoke about the increasing prevalence of inclusive design:
 “AT is disappearing to some extent, because of the inclusive design
 approach that we’re encouraging organisations to take. Inevitably,
 that’s going to have an effect on AT suppliers.”
</p>
<p> 
 Later in the session, a delegate from Barclays asked the panel a question
 that had been touched on in many discussions throughout the day: “What
 can the AT industry do to support the needs of older consumers?”
</p>
<p> 
 Gareth Ford Williams’ answer summed up what many had been thinking:
 “This issue is going to affect everyone. We’re an ageing population and
 part of the ageing process is a decline in all our faculties – cognitive,
 physical and sensory. It’s part of getting old. [The solution is] about
 designing for your own future. Get it right now and you’ll have a much
 better future.”
