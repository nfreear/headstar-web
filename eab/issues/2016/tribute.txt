As many readers of e-Access Bulletin will know, the publication’s editor
and founder, Dan Jellinek, passed away in October last year. This tragic
event was completely unexpected and utterly devastating news for everyone
that knew Dan. As well as the immeasurable loss to his family, countless
good friends and colleagues, Dan’s passing will also be felt deeply
throughout the digital accessibility sector, an area to which he contributed
so much invaluable work.

Accessibility was not Dan’s only area of expertise and interest, but it
was always a sustained passion and something he felt compelled to cover
journalistically. This was probably because he knew that intelligent,
informed, progressive coverage – which his always was – could help push
forward the important issues and the debates that needed to be had.

To mark his achievements in the sector, some of his many friends and
colleagues have paid tribute to Dan, sharing their thoughts about his work
and influence on digital accessibility.


- Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion, AbilityNet:
“I was shocked and deeply saddened when I heard of Dan’s passing. I had
known Dan for well over a decade and admired his work, but even more so Dan
as a person. He had a way of quietly asking the right questions, both when
interviewing you for the always-informative e-Access Bulletin and when
chatting over a coffee about the state of the world, and in particular how
it could be made a better place through people embracing a more inclusive
approach to technology and design.
