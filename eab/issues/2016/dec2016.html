Earlier this year, the National Health Service introduced the Accessible Information Standard throughout England, as a way of improving health information access for patients with impairments. The legally binding framework requires organisations to provide information in alternative formats if requested, such as Braille or audio. Reactions have been mixed since the introduction, with some people claiming that they still have difficulties acquiring alternative format information.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Inaccessible Websites Dent Business Profits, As Online Shoppers‘Click Away’.
</h3>
<p> 
 UK businesses are losing out on huge sums of money – potentially
 totalling billions of pounds – by failing to make their websites
 accessible to users with access needs, new research claims.
</p>
<p> 
 Published by disability consultancy Freeney Williams, the Click-Away Pound
 (CAP) Survey assessed the “online shopping experience of customers with
 disabilities, and the costs to business of ignoring them.”
</p>
<p> 
 The report revealed that 71% of disabled customers with access needs will
 ‘click away’ from a website that they find difficult to use. A key
 finding from the survey was that the spending power of these online
 shoppers who click away is &pound;11.75 billion – money which is then spent
 elsewhere by those same shoppers, on sites that they can access.
</p>
<p> 
 Launching the survey results at an event in London to coincide with the
 International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Rick Williams – co-author
 of the survey and managing director of Freeney Williams – said: “As a
 business, why would you design a website that people can’t use? That &pound;12
 billion is displaced spending. It’s astonishing – the sheer size of
 that number surprised us. Businesses are losing opportunities for that
 money.”
</p>
<p> 
 The CAP Survey also notes that, “Businesses need to bear in mind that if
 a disabled shopper clicks away from their site to one of their competitors,
 they show little inclination to return.”
</p>
<p> 
 The CAP Survey was initially launched in January (as reported in e-Access
 Bulletin issue 176: <a href="http://eab.li/48">http://eab.li/48</a>
 ) and closed in July, collecting results from 362 participants. Some estimates from the report are based
 around applying trends found in the results to national level, using data
 from the Office of National Statistics, among other sources.
</p>
<p> 
 While the key messages behind the research will be familiar to many
 e-Access Bulletin readers, the findings will likely come as a surprise to
 many businesses. The CAP Survey claims that, “Most businesses will be
 unaware that they are losing income, because more than 90% of customers who
 have difficulty using a site will not contact them.”
</p>
<p> 
 In fact, the survey found that over 80% of online shoppers with access
 needs will choose to spend their money on websites with the fewest barriers
 in place for them, as opposed to the cheapest.
</p>
<p> 
 The five most common website problems identified by survey respondents
 were: crowded pages; poor link information; filling in forms; moving images
 or graphics; and poor legibility, including colour contrast and text
 layout.
</p>
<p> 
 Screen-readers were found to be the most common type of assistive
 technology (AT) used by respondents, with 53% of all respondents using some
 form of AT. As the CAP Survey points out, “No matter how sophisticated or
 efficient AT might be or how competent its user, unless a website is
 designed and developed to take access needs into account, the capacity of
 AT to overcome access barriers will always be limited.”
</p>
<p> 
 The report finishes by explaining that while the 2016 CAP Survey has
 “established a point of departure,” a follow-up survey is also planned
 for next year. The 2017 CAP Survey will examine the subject in relation to
 specific business sectors, and beyond the UK.

<h3 id="i185-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Video Games Without The Visuals For Blind Gamers.</h3>
<p> 
 A series of five new audio-based video games for blind and visually
 impaired users are being designed, after a crowdfunding campaign to support
 the project achieved over 150% of its target funding.
</p>
<p> 
 The games, including versions of classic arcade title ‘Frogger’ and a
 cricket game, will be available on mobile devices, tablet computers and
 desktop computers, through the iOS and Andriod operating systems, as well
 as Windows PC.
</p>
<p> 
 In April 2016, the Audio Game Hub project released a free package of eight
 “experimental arcade videogames” that relied on audio, rather than
 visuals. Designed primarily for people with sight loss, the games were
 fully playable without the need to look at a screen, featuring an option to
 turn off the visuals completely. The games – including ‘Archery’,
 ‘Samurai Tournament’ and ‘Slot Machines’ – proved incredibly
 popular with both non-sighted and sighted users, receiving over 33,000
 downloads.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio Game Hub founder Jarek Beksa told e-Access Bulletin that the idea
 came several years ago, when testing equipment at a telecoms company:
 “During one of the tests we spoke with a blind user. He told us ‘Nobody
 makes games for us.’ Since then, we started thinking about the idea of
 creating accessible games, Beksa said.
</p>
<p> 
 The team behind Audio Game Hub – based in Auckland, New Zealand – were
 soon inundated with requests for more games, so they launched a Kickstarter
 crowdfunding campaign in November. People who backed the campaign also
 voted on which games the team should develop, chosen from a list of 14.
</p>
<p> 
 In just ten days, the campaign had exceeded its goal of 6,000 New Zealand
 Dollars (approximately &pound;3,370) by 150%. Most of the money will be spent on
 sound production and voice recording for the games, Beksa said.
</p>
<p> 
 The five games chosen by people who donated to the campaign were:
 ‘Frogger’, a version of a 1981 arcade game where the user has to guide
 a frog safely across a busy road; ‘Cricket’; ‘Simon + Super Simon’,
 a memory game where users remember commands and sequences; ‘Blackjack –
 21’, a popular casino card game; and ‘Runner’, where users control a
 character running through different terrains.
</p>
<p> 
 The new games will be available as in-app purchases through the existing
 Audio Game Hub collection, which is free to download.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition to the five chosen titles, another game, ‘Whispering
 Tunnels’, will be released as a standalone purchasable app. According to
 the Kickstarter campaign page, ‘Whispering Tunnels’ is “an audio
 role-playing game specially tailored for the visually impaired”. Players
 must solve puzzles, avoid traps, battle monsters and engage in dialogues to
 escape from a tunnel.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio Game Hub was created in collaboration with the Gamification Lab of
 the Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Germany, and the School of Computer
 and Mathematical Sciences of Auckland University of Technology, New
 Zealand. The project is also sponsored by Auckland University and the
 AbleGamers Charity.

<h3 id="i185-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Google Maps Begins Listing Venue Accessibility Information.</h3>
<p> 
 Google Maps app now tells users whether some locations are
 wheelchair-accessible, thanks to the efforts of a Google employee in his
 spare time.
</p>
<p> 
 Rio Akasaka, a product manager for cloud storage service Google Drive,
 undertook the project using his ‘20% time’ – a well-known Google
 employee policy that allows staff to spend 20 per cent of their time
 working on projects unrelated to their role at the company.
</p>
<p> 
 In an interview with the ‘Business Insider’ news website earlier this
 month about the project, Akasaka explained that he led a small team of
 Google employees, who worked to add the accessibility information to
 certain venues in the mobile app version of Google Maps. The data was
 collected by Google’s ‘Local Guides’, a community of millions of
 users who volunteer to answer questions about places they visit when using
 Google Maps. This information helps Google improve its maps and provide
 more detailed information to other users.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this year, Google began asking its Local Guides accessibility
 questions about venues they were visiting. Millions of responses were
 collected, enabling Google to begin adding this information to map venues.
</p>
<p> 
 When users click on a venue description in Google Maps to view its
 features, the ‘Amenities’ section now lists whether the venue has a
 wheelchair-accessible entrance – as long as the information has been
 collected and logged.
</p>
<p> 
 Akasaka also said in the interview that he believes this information will
 benefit other users, as well as those using wheelchairs, such as people
 with prams or those who use a cane to walk.

<h3 id="i185-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Assisting Vision:</h3>
<p>  Digital vision aids, such as a handheld digital magnifier, are the preferred tools of young people with low vision,
 according to new research. ‘Design and Low Vision Aids – a Youth
 Perspective’ is published by Thomas Pocklington Trust, the Helen Hamlyn
 Centre for Design, VISION 2020 UK and VICTA, and explores how
 12-18-year-olds with low vision use vision aids – such as smartphones,
 magnifiers and screen-readers – to increase their independence. Good
 design and covertness of vision aids were found to be important to young
 people, as was mainstream technology which combines traditional functions
 with assistive features.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Special report.- The NHS Accessible Information Standard.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Changing Standards.</h3>
<p> 
 At the end of July, the National Health Service (NHS) Accessible
 Information Standard was implemented throughout England. This means that
 any organisation providing NHS care or adult social care is now legally
 obliged to provide information in accessible formats, so that people with a
 disability or impairment (those who may not be able to access or read text
 and information in the traditional form) have the same access to health
 information as any other NHS user.
</p>
<p> 
 This includes an obligation for organisations to provide alternative
 information formats to meet individuals’ requirements, including Braille,
 electronic and audio formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The specification of the Accessible Information Standard highlights the
 Equality Act 2010 as a legal basis for implementation (alongside a
 ‘compelling moral and ethical imperative’), and also notes that the
 Standard is “unashamedly ambitious” in its overall aim of providing
 “clear direction for a dramatic improvement in the ability of the NHS and
 adult social care system to meet the information and communication support
 needs of disabled people.”
</p>
<p> 
 It also notes that applicable organisations have a legal obligation to
 follow the standard.
</p>
<p> 
 This is clearly a much-needed and positive step forwards in terms of
 accessible information, and many people with an impairment have been
 waiting years for such a move.
</p>
<p> 
 However, e-Access Bulletin has received correspondence from some readers
 who have had continued problems and difficulties in obtaining alternative
 format information, despite the Standard being in place. Their suggestion
 was that the Standard has not been properly or effectively implemented in
 all organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 In the interest of balance, it is worth noting that implementing such a
 Standard is clearly a huge undertaking. Some have argued that teething
 troubles are to be expected, while others say that things are simply not
 working as they should be. The important thing now, it seems, is for the
 Standard to be understood and implemented as widely and effectively as
 possible, so that people who need accessible information can receive it as
 quickly and smoothly as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 To give an overall picture of the current situation, e-Access Bulletin has
 collected comments from four different sources: two Bulletin readers who
 have encountered difficulties in obtaining accessible information; the
 Patient Information Forum (an independent, membership organisation for
 people working in healthcare information and support), and NHS England.
 These comments, published below, aim to explain the Standard and provide a
 view of how well it is currently working, but also – crucially – to
 explore what can be done to improve implementation.
</p>
<p> 
 - Penny Melville-Brown OBE, Director of Disability Dynamics and e-Access
 Bulletin reader:
</p>
<p> 
 “Like other organisations providing services to the public, the NHS knows
 that some disabled people have extra needs when it comes to communications
 and information. The NHS Accessible Information Standard requires
 accessible and alternate formats.
</p>
<p> 
 “More disabled people should get the healthcare we need – people with
 visual or hearing impairments have a higher risk of other long-term
 conditions, including dementia. People with alternative information or
 communication needs should take the following steps:
</p>
<p> 
 “Tell their GP practice manager; ask them to share those needs across the
 NHS; make sure their reasonable needs are met – not just what someone
 thinks will work; make sure the Standard is applied to all information;
 keep on asking – people are still learning; encourage others to ask too.
</p>
<p> 
 “Personal struggles with a leading eye hospital and GP practice show that
 some organisations need help to understand and change their systems. To get
 standard letters, appointment confirmations, surgery consent forms, routine
 leaflets, after-care instructions, etc, sent by email without hopelessly
 complicated security, I had to escalate requests to chief executive-level.
</p>
<p> 
 “One response included asking a blind person to read the bold wording –
 showing what still needs to be learned.”
</p>
<p> 
 More information on accessible communications can be found and downloaded
 at the Disability Dynamics blog:
 <a href="http://eab.li/42">http://eab.li/42</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 - Brian Gaff, of Kingston upon Thames Talking Newspaper (run by the
 Kingston upon Thames Association for the Blind), and e-Access Bulletin
 reader:
</p>
<p> 
 “One of the most frustrating things we hear about – and encounter –
 at the newspaper is lack of knowledge of healthcare and other government
 departments, about how it is possible to make their information accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 “Many people have asked for things like appointment letters in either
 plain text emails or audio. Surely, with access to the raw text that most
 government sources must have, this should be a no-brainer.
</p>
<p> 
 “Now that the Accessible Information Standard has come into force, we are
 meant to be able to tell our GP our information choices, which feeds
 through to every part of the NHS and social care that we access – except
 it is not working, since everyone thinks it is somebody else’s job, not
 theirs.
</p>
<p> 
 “Seeing as this is not just an access issue but an independent living one
 as well, it seems to me that the Standard has been rolled out with little
 or no training to people in the areas who are going to implement it. There
 is web training and tests, but a busy department head is unlikely to have
 seen any of this.
</p>
<p> 
 “So, as far as getting government departments to get on the accessibility
 train with the commercial sector, somebody in government is going to have
 to bite the bullet and spend some money to train people, or else no matter
 how many times the law is broken, nothing will happen.
</p>
<p> 
 “I will say, however, that my local GP Practice Manager has tried long
 and hard to make this work, but outside of their practice it seems that the
 doors are closed right now.
</p>
<p> 
 “In terms of solutions, I would say: get a standard of good practice and
 get everyone using the same resources. This would hopefully save money and
 hopefully get communication about patients’ health working.”

 .</p>
<p> 
 - From NHS England, with a contribution from Dr Clare Mander, Clinical Lead
 for Accessible Information at Solent NHS Trust:
</p>
<p> 
 “The Standard sets out, for the first time, how all providers of NHS or
 adult social care must identify, record, flag, share and meet the
 information and communication support needs of people with a disability,
 impairment or sensory loss.
</p>
<p> 
 “Co-produced with a range of voluntary organisations, and with disabled
 people themselves, the Standard has been called a ‘step change’ in
 disabled people’s access to healthcare.
</p>
<p> 
 “As with any new, national initiative, the speed and effectiveness of
 implementation will vary. We are aware of fantastic work going on (for
 example, East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust has made significant progress
 in implementing the Standard) and have seen an increase in requests for
 large-print formats and audio, as well as via email, text and British Sign
 Language interpreter.
</p>
<p> 
 “As Dr Clare Mander, Clinical Lead for Accessible Information at Solent
 NHS Trust, explains: ‘We welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the
 development and implementation of the national standard. The legal
 requirements have galvanised a decade of local developments, which include
 qualitative research, service evaluations and innovation projects.
 Implementation of the standard across a Community and Mental Health Trust,
 with over 100 clinical sites, is no easy task.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘In 2015, we began a project to develop a tiered model of accessible
 information training that was co-produced with patients living with
 communication and information needs. Our awareness DVD has now been rolled
 out across the Trust, an interactive accessible information learning
 platform is in development, and a programme of specialist training has been
 piloted with ten services.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Through this specialist training, champions were identified and formed a
 new accessible information network that will link with our patient leads.
 The network aims to facilitate collective intelligence and social learning
 to improve accessible information practice across the Trust. We still have
 a long way to go, but together we have the opportunities to make a real
 difference.’
</p>
<p> 
 “We advise anyone experiencing difficulties with receiving accessible
 information and/or communication support to follow the relevant complaints
 process. The NHS complaints process is explained on the NHS Choices
 website, at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/40">http://eab.li/40</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 “Resources to support implementation are available on the NHS England
 website, at the following link:
 <a href="http://eab.li/41">http://eab.li/41</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 “During January-March 2017, there will be a review of the Standard to
 look at the impact it has had and to ensure that it is ‘fit for
 purpose’. Anyone wanting to get involved should join the distribution
 list, by emailing the following address: <a href="mailto:england.nhs.participation@nhs.net">england.nhs.participation@nhs.net</a>
 .
</p>
<p> 
 “Patients can also contact the Customer Contact Centre on the following
 phone UK number: 0300 311 22 33.”
</p>
<p> 
 - From The Patient Information Forum (PIF), with a contribution from Claire
 Murray, Joint Head of Operations:
</p>
<p> 
 “To support organisations to implement the Accessible Information
 Standard, PIF has launched a free-to-join online discussion group, where
 members can ask questions and share their experiences.
</p>
<p> 
 “Nearly 500 people have joined the group so far, and discussions have
 covered topics such as patient records, service user surveys in alternative
 communication formats, consent and ‘flagging’ communication needs.
</p>
<p> 
 “The group brings together people from across the NHS and local
 authorities, including people with specialist experience in developing
 accessible information from voluntary, statutory and commercial
 organisations. Through these interactions, the group has also shared useful
 resources on developing information in accessible formats, locally
 developed policies, and debunking some myths about the Standard.
</p>
<p> 
 “Claire Murray, Joint Head of Operations at PIF, says: ‘It’s been
 great to be part of bringing together such a diverse group of people around
 this important new Standard, to help increase understanding and expertise
 in developing truly accessible information.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Good information is vital to support people to understand and engage
 with their health and health services, and we know people with
 communication needs still face significant barriers in accessing this.
</p>

 ‘It’s not just the format of an information resource that affects its
 accessibility, and the ultimate judge of the usefulness of any piece of
 health information is the patient or service user engaging with it.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘At PIF we believe that involving users in developing or adapting
 accessible information resources is a crucial step to delivering genuinely
 accessible information.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Implementing the Accessible Information Standard is not just a
 box-ticking exercise, it’s a fantastic opportunity for organisations to
 learn what really makes health information understandable for their users,
 and how best this can be delivered.’”
