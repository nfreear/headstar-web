<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Uk’S First Inbuilt Text-To-Speech Tvs Hit The Shelves.</h3>
<p> 
 Electronics manufacturer Panasonic has built text-to-speech
 functionality into 30 of its television models, designed
 specifically to help blind and visually impaired users, making
 them the first such TVs to become available on the UK general
 market.
</p>
<p> 
 After switching on the function during installation, text-to-
 speech will be present over a wide range of tasks in the
 televisions, including speaking the channel number and name
 of a programme when switching channels; the time that a
 programme begins and ends; and whether other accessibility
 features such as audio description are available for a
 programme.
</p>
<p> 
 Text-to-speech assistance is provided on connecting to a Wi-Fi
 network through the TV, and users can also to scroll through a
 TV’s electronic programme guide and listen to the list of
 programmes, timing information and a synopsis of each
 programme.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin, Nigel Prankard, IPTV and
 digital TV solutions centre manager at Panasonic, said a lower
 implementation cost of text-to-speech in recent times had
 enabled the company to offer the functionality.
</p>
<p> 
 “If you asked us to introduce text-to-speech [into our
 televisions] two years ago, the extra cost would have been
 significant, but with the onset of activity in the IT world, the
 implementation costs of text-to-speech have come down,
 enabling us to put it into the TVs without passing on the cost to
 customers”, Prankard said.
</p>
<p> 
 Panasonic worked with the Royal National Institute of Blind
 People to build the text-to-speech function, undertaking user-
 testing with a prototype before gathering feedback and making
 improvements to the final design.
</p>
<p> 
 Prankard said he hopes to further improve the functionality
 and add more features if there is positive feedback from the
 initial models, possibly looking at how text-to-speech could
 work for internet-connected TVs. “The W3C [World Wide
 Web Consortium] are trying to make more regulatory
 requirements for web accessibility, so we may have to think
 how TVs could handle [web accessibility requirements] if we
 give them the full ability to go to websites”, he said.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Call For Global Body To Boost Accessibilityprofessionalism.
</h3>
<p> 
 The accessibility field needs a new international community of
 experts to help it become a recognised profession, Microsoft’s
 Chief Accessibility Officer told a recent conference.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the sixth European Forum on e-Accessibility in
 Paris ( <a href="http://bit.ly/wHNjGf">http://bit.ly/wHNjGf</a>
 ), Rob Sinclair said: “The time has come for accessibility to transcend its origin and become an
 internationally recognised profession.”
</p>
<p> 
 Specialist expertise groups have helped the security and
 privacy sectors become valued fields of interest over the past
 decade, said Sinclair, and a similar group could perform
 equally important functions for accessibility, such as: creating
 and maintaining a globally-endorsed set of educational
 resources; training and certifying accessibility professionals;
 building a global community of experts; and helping related
 efforts around the world co-ordinate work.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite significant progress in accessibility over the past two
 decades, we are far from achieving digital inclusion, Sinclair
 said. There are various reasons for this, he said, including that
 most design or engineering educational programmes do not
 incorporate accessibility into their structure; and that there is a
 lack of formal qualifications available to evaluate and rate
 accessibility experts.
</p>
<p> 
 The ultimate goal should be for accessibility expertise to be
 disseminated throughout businesses, organisations and
 government, to provide customers with a proper support
 network, he said. “These outcomes are possible, but will
 require broad-reaching international collaboration and
 dedicated resources”.

<h3 id="i146-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Councils Still Struggling With Website Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Almost half of local authority websites remain inaccessible to
 disabled users, according to the annual ‘Better Connected’
 review of UK local authority sites, carried out by the Society of
 IT Management (Socitm).
</p>
<p> 
 Little has changed in the picture of council website
 accessibility since last year’s Better Connected, with only a 2%
 increase in the amount of councils achieving the assessment’s
 standard rating for accessibility – from 56% in 2011 to 58%
 (252 councils) this year. Within those 252 sites, only two
 (Kettering Borough Council and the London Borough of
 Merton) were rated as ‘Very Good’ under the scoring system,
 while 30% of websites (130 in total) were rated as having
 ‘Poor’ accessibility, and 12% (51 sites) were classed as
 ‘Inaccessible’.
</p>
<p> 
 “Accessibility should not be seen as an extra layer of usability
 to build into a site for a minority of users, however
 significant”, the report says. “Accessible websites are also
 easier to use for everyone.”
</p>
<p> 
 To rate accessibility in this year’s Better Connected, testers
 from the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB),
 assessed the home page and other key pages of a council’s
 website; and how easy it was to complete three ‘top tasks’ for
 users, such as finding out how to pay council tax, and applying
 for a council job.
</p>
<p> 
 When scoring these tasks, RNIB testers identified three
 potential website accessibility issues that would prevent them
 completely from carrying out the task: keyboard traps (when
 keyboard navigation of a webpage causes a user to become
 irreversibly stuck on an element of that page); auto-starting
 audio on a page (with no way of stopping the audio); and
 flashing content.
</p>
<p> 
 These elements are also flagged-up in the latest version of the
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0:
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/</a>
 ), which were used as part of the basis for assessment.
</p>
<p> 
 The report recommends that all councils should carry out user-
 testing with groups of disabled people; build accessibility
 checks into the website publishing process; and ensure that the
 entire web team understands and practices accessibility.

<p>  New software which suggests potential accessibility solutions to users while they work on a
 computer was demonstrated by staff from Loughborough and
 Dundee universities at a workshop by the Sus-IT project – a
 research initiative addressing ICT barriers faced by the elderly.
 The software – which is still in development – aims to help
 people who experience age-related changes in vision, dexterity
 and memory, and works by monitoring users’ computer
 behaviour and habits, and picking up on problems
 encountered. Solutions to these problems are then suggested to
 the user, either from pre-existing assistance in the computer’s
 operating system, or separate assistive technology.

<h3 id="i146-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Petitions Continued:</h3>
<p>  Reader John Sexton writes in to contribute to our ongoing debate on how the government’s
 electronic petitions website ( <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/</a>
 ) is hard for some people to use because a “captcha” audio anti-
 spam test can be hard to hear clearly.
</p>
<p> 
 “The use of so called CAPTCHAs is both not accessible and
 not effective!” says John. “They not only prevent most people
 who rely on assistive technology [from accessing petitions] but
 also many other people!
</p>
<p> 
 “The reason for such systems is to identify if it is a person or
 bot accessing the online resource. The fact is with
 advancements in OCR and Voice Recognition, many bots can
 get past these tests, making it non-effective. There are much
 better methods of determining if a person is accessing an
 online resource, such as email verification, timed response
 rates and server-side spam filters.”
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, CAPTCHAs are now a dated technology, like mouse-
 driven menu systems, which are inaccessible to a wide range of
 people, not just disabled people, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 “If the government can’t get it right online then they should
 offer alternative methods of petitioning. Otherwise they are
 failing their own Equality Act 2010 and it should be taken up
 with the EU and UN!”
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="i146-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Graphic Debate:</h3>
<p>  Last issue’s news story on a report which found that a lack of access to information graphics in tactile
 form is holding back blind people in the workplace, when the
 problem could be tackled by software adapting Braille printers
 to produce graphics, has generated lively debate on our blog.
</p>
<p> 
 John Gardner said his own company’s ViewPlus software and
 embossers can reproduce a wide range of charts and tables in
 Braille. “The Tiger Software Suite, bundled with every
 ViewPlus embosser can transform and emboss an Excel spread
 sheet or chart in Braille with one click”, he said. “More
 complex graphics, such as flow charts, can be made
 audio/touch accessible. These products have been on the
 market for years.”
</p>
<p> 
 However, the report’s author, John Ramm, replied: “Putting
 aside the abilities or otherwise of particular embossers to
 produce graphics, what my research shows is that blind people
 are not getting them. It surely doesn’t matter how much
 hardware and software is available if transcribers are taking a
 de facto position that when they come across a graphic in
 something they are transcribing they produce a verbal
 description, not an equivalent graphic.
</p>
<p> 
 “The blind people I interviewed should not need to know or
 care about how transcribed material is produced. All they want,
 overwhelmingly, is transcribed material which puts them on a
 par with their sighted colleagues.”

<h3 id="i146-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Standard Reference:</h3>
<p>  Finally, a correction to some terminology about standards used in our last issue, as pointed
 out by Dave Sawdon: we mentioned PAS78 as “the first British
 Standards Specification for web design” – in fact, as Dave
 points out, PAS78 was a “guide to good practice in
 commissioning accessible websites”, and was written by a team
 of volunteer experts, including himself and led by Julie
 Howell.
</p>
<p> 
 “The point is important because of the need for readers to
 understand that just about everyone has agreed to harmonise
 on the W3C web content accessibility guidelines as the
 specification for technical web accessibility, and that unique
 national requirements are not helpful or appropriate. This was
 recognised in PAS78, and in BS8878 which superseded it”, he
 says.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special ReportDigital books in Italy.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Reading Without Barriersby Michele Smargiassi.
</h3>
<p> 
 They can’t see their books: but maybe this is why blind people
 read with such an extraordinary passion. On average, a blind
 person in Italy reads 9.2 books a year, while among sighted
 Italians only two in ten people read so many. Six blind people
 out of ten read a few pages of a book at least once a week,
 while 53.2% of Italians never, ever, read. In other words, blind
 people read significantly more than sighted people.
</p>
<p> 
 “The thirst for knowledge is strongest where there is a barrier,”
 says Orlando Paladino, president of the Unione Italiana Ciechi
 (Italian Union of the Blind). Or perhaps, where a barrier falls.
 The data outlined above from a new survey by the Italian
 Publishers’ Association (Associazione Italiana Editori – AIE:
 <a href="http://www.aie.it">http://www.aie.it</a>
 ) would probably have been very different 15 years ago, when it was impossible to read books on a
 computer, or to have them translated into Braille on a tactile
 display.
</p>
<p> 
 In the recent past, books readable by blind people were very
 few in number and not very often updated. These were books
 printed in Braille, the characters formed out of dots that turned
 even the slim Italian Constitution into a kilo of paper that could
 only be crammed into an ordinary bag with difficulty. The
 digital age has radically changed the lives of enthusiastic blind
 readers. In the era of e-books, their library finally seems to be
 the same as everyone else’s, including new publications.
</p>
<p> 
 Has the problem been solved, then? Can blind people now read
 what they want? And what do they read?
</p>
<p> 
 “I have no preferences,” is the surprising response of some
 46.7% of respondents to a new survey, but this apparent
 indifference can be interpreted as: “There is so little stuff for
 us to read, I must content myself with what I find.” Clearly, the
 revolution of books without barriers remains unfinished.
</p>
<p> 
 “Most e-books on the market still can’t be read by speech-
 synthesis software or by Braille translators; some can be read
 only with enormous obstacles and difficulties, as they have no
 indexes and hypertext notes, no paratexts, catalogues or
 directories”, explains Cristina Mussinelli, coordinator of the
 LIA project (Libri Italiani Accessibili, Italian Accessible
 Books), which, with the cooperation of the major publishers,
 will produce and make available to blind and partially sighted
 people an initial package of three thousand titles within a year,
 designed to be easily readable by the special access software
 and hardware used by blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 Literature, essays, and handbooks: in fact, blind people do
 have specific preferences, and they are generally much more
 demanding than the average reader. AIE launched its survey,
 which yielded such astonishing results, to find the best way to
 compose its first specialist catalogue for blind readers.
</p>
<p> 
 Since then, much water has passed under the bridge. In 2000,
 three of the major Italian publishers threatened a legal action
 for copyright infringement against two pioneering institutions
 for the blind, the Istituto Cavazza of Bologna and the Galiano
 Foundation of Catanzaro. Tired of their empty shelves, these
 organisations had dared to fill them themselves, scanning and
 putting on the internet a thousand titles in electronic text
 format, to make them available to blind readers. This was a
 service that commercial publishing had not provided to what
 they considered “a small niche” of customers, though, in fact,
 it is not so small: in Italy, there are 362,000 blind people and
 one million visually impaired people, and on the whole they
 love to read, as we have seen.
</p>
<p> 
 The ensuing clamor and indignation eventually obliged the
 publishers to withdraw the complaint. So, eleven years ago it
 was already possible to fill the gap of access to the texts. Yet
 blind people had to wait a long time before anyone thought of
 them as normal readers, or even more devoted than normal. In
 2005 the Ministry for Cultural Heritage funded a project aimed
 at building a digital library for the blind, but in 2011 that
 project was assigned to UIC and AIE. “There have been
 incomprehensible bureaucratic delays, against which I raised
 my voice a year ago, at the Frankfurt exhibition”, says Mark
 Polillo, President of the publishers.
</p>
<p> 
 The trouble now is that due to the enormous delay, the project
 (conceived when the e-book did not exist) must quickly be
 updated; it can no longer replace digital publishing, if anything
 it must stimulate it. “The real goal is to force publishers to
 consider accessibility for the blind as a requirement of their
 normal e-books”, Polillo says. “Only then, at last, will the blind
 will be customers of a library, like everyone else”.
