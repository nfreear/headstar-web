<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Graphics Formats Holding Back Blind People Inworkplace.
</h3>
<p> 
 Lack of access to information graphics in tactile form is
 holding back blind people in the workplace, when the problem
 could be tackled by relatively simple software to adapt Braille
 printers to produce graphics, according to a report published
 this week.
</p>
<p> 
 The independent research report, “Touching the world”, is the
 product of a two-year specialist fellowship with the Clore
 Social Leadership Programme funded by RNIB. Based on
 interviews with 12 blind people, the study was carried out by
 accessible technology specialist John Ramm, with support from
 University of Sussex research fellow Frances Aldrich.
</p>
<p> 
 Blind people often come across data at work set in tables,
 graphics, charts and other graphical formats but it is extremely
 rare to receive such information in tactile form, the report
 finds. This means most often they rely on descriptions of
 graphics from colleagues or support workers, which creates a
 sense of dependency and inequality and are much harder to
 use.
</p>
<p> 
 “The de facto standard at the minute for anything graphical
 seems to be to write a description of it, which to me is a really
 feeble attempt at best, because the whole reason for putting it
 into a graphic in the first place is it makes it easier for people to
 grasp the big picture,” Ramm told E-Access Bulletin. “Then I
 have to reconstruct in my head, I can’t just read off
 information.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ironically, in the days before widespread computing when
 Braille materials were produced manually from steel embossing
 sheet, the situation for graphics was better because they could
 be embossed onto the same sheets, he said. More recently
 Braille production has become automated, with machines
 outputting it directly from software, but the issue of graphics
 appears to have been overlooked.
</p>
<p> 
 The answer is to develop new software and standards which
 use automated Braille dots in freer formats to build graphics
 alongside character cells, Ramm said. “If you have a pie chart
 and it is only a rudimentary circle shape, that’s fine. For the
 purposes of a pie chart, it doesn’t really matter, all your want to
 know is how things split up.”
</p>
<p> 
 He said tables could be produced more easily in Braille if there
 were better ways to abbreviate numbers and put the data into
 columns. “What most of these bits of software they don’t even
 try to do anything graphical with tables – they make each row
 as a new paragraph, with no attempt to recreate columns at all.
 It’s pointless.”
</p>
<p> 
 The study finds some blind people may currently be deterred
 from applying for some jobs altogether because of the
 difficulty in accessing tables and charts. One participant said:
 “I am very put off jobs where I think the content is going to be
 quite graphical... That would actually make a decision for me,
 probably, because I think it adds another layer of need for
 assistance.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately however, blind employees may have to resort to
 legal action to force through equal provision, the study says.
</p>
<p> 
 “It is quite possible that some test discrimination cases could be
 brought to show employers, universities, training institutions
 and others that the vague verbal descriptions are just not
 sufficient alternative provision when those who can see have a
 diagram in front of them,” it says.
</p>
<p> 
 “There is a serious disconnect between the colourful, varied,
 eye-catching, multimedia world of printed material and the
 bland, text-based, serial Braille material which blind people
 receive – if they get anything at all.”
</p>
<p>

 aspiring leaders in the social sector through fellowships of up
 to two years. To download a copy of the new report visit:

<h3 id="i145-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Trial In Spain For Accessible Medicines App.</h3>
<p> 
 A major new trial in Spain using mobile devices to make
 prescription medicine information more accessible has been
 approved by the project’s partners including charities,
 pharmaceutical industry representatives and government
 bodies.
</p>
<p> 
 The &quot;Accessible Medicine” project will use two-dimensional
 Data Matrix square barcodes placed on medicine boxes and
 packaging allowing people to use an application or “app”
 running on a smartphone or other mobile device with a camera
 to link to detailed medicine information online. The
 information can then be spoken aloud or conveyed in other
 formats on the mobile device according to user needs and
 preferences.
</p>
<p> 
 The project is being led by Vodafone Spain Foundation with a
 range of partners including Technosite, the trading and research
 arm of Spanish national blindness charity ONCE; and the
 Spanish Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and
 Associations (FARMAINDUSTRIA).
</p>
<p> 
 The partners say beneficiaries of the system will include not
 only blind people and people with impaired vision but also
 people who have difficulties handling the small folded leaflets
 currently issued with medicines.
</p>
<p> 
 The new trial has been approved following successful phase
 one trials ending last year. Developments for phase two include
 expansion of the online drug database from five to the 30 most
 commonly-used medicines; and improvements to the design
 interface.
</p>
<p> 
 Alongside the trials, ONCE is working with the Spanish Agency
 of Medicine and Health Products to create a database with
 accessible information on all available medicines.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the phase one report, the system has possible
 applications in other fields such as information about food and
 clothing. More information can be found in Spanish only at the
 project’s website:

<h3 id="i145-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Video Game Communities Could Boost Social Inclusion.</h3>
<p> 
 Online communities built around popular video games could
 help build social inclusion for disadvantaged groups including
 disabled people, a digital games expert involved in a new
 European research project told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion (DGEI)
 research project, funded by the European Commission, held its
 first meeting in Seville last month. The project aims to examine
 uses of digital games for social purposes such as health,
 training, education, social inclusion and other public services –
 so-called “serious games”. After the researching the current
 state of play it aims to develop an action plan to help realise
 games’ social potential.
</p>
<p> 
 However the use of games for social benefit is wider than
 simply the use of gaming techniques to create “serious games”
 with a social or educational purpose, says Scott Colfer, project
 manager of internet channel Young Dads TV (
 <a href="http://www.youngdads.tv/">http://www.youngdads.tv/</a>
 ) and participant in the Seville event.</p>
<p> 
 He told E-Access Bulletin there was big untapped potential in
 building support communities around existing popular games,
 which already feature online player communities.
</p>
<p> 
 “The big computer games have a budget bigger than a large
 motion picture,” Colfer said. “It’s hard to match that, so it
 might be better to see how communities around games can be
 used.” One model might be the UK-based group GamerDads, a
 group of young fathers who set up their own online community
 to play games online (<a href="http://www.gamerdads.co.uk/">http://www.gamerdads.co.uk/</a>
 ), Colfer said.
</p>
<p> 
 “They were tired of playing in normal gamer groups where if
 you leave during a game, it’s frowned on. But they may have
 to leave the game because they are looking after their kids.”
 From coming together as gamers, the group had developed into
 one of the largest online communities of fathers, and members
 were offering each other informal support outside the gaming
 sphere, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 “Now they work on other things together, they support a
 particular charity, and they do it all themselves, there’s no
 government input.” Similar communities could work well for
 disabled gamers, Colfer said.

<h3 id="i145-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Petition Protest:</h3>
<p>  In our last issue David Bates, of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) UK, wrote in to say the
 government’s official electronic petitions website
 (<a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/</a>
) was hard for him to use because a “captcha” audio anti-spam test was hard to hear
 clearly.
</p>
<p> 
 His message is strongly supported by Pat Onions, a registered
 blind person who with a group of disabled people and carers
 has launched a petition calling on the government to “Stop and
 review the cuts to benefits and services which are falling
 disproportionately on disabled people, their carers and
 families”:
 <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20968">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/20968</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Pat writes: “I am only too aware of the huge barriers faced by
 not only blind people but, many, many disabled people in
 lacking the ability to sign this petition. It is a petition for
 disabled people and yet they are excluded completely by their
 own disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “The sounds that I have to listen to are quite inaudible even
 with perfect hearing. Together with others with sight loss this
 has been taken up with those responsible for the site but their
 interest is nil.”
</p>
<p> 
 She continues: “I had an email telling me this is a problem
 which will be looked at ‘sometime in the future’. Disabled
 people are fighting for their lives, under the devastating
 destruction of the Welfare Reform Bill and are being totally
 denied a platform to show their feelings.
</p>
<p> 
 “We do not have time to wait for ‘sometime in the future’. I
 know there are tens of thousands who want to sign this
 petition. I have written to [Leader of the House of Commons]
 Sir George Young but as yet had no reply. Why aren't I
 surprised?”
</p>
<p> 
 Regular correspondent Brian Gaff, who is on the committee of
 the Kingston upon Thames Association for the Blind, writes in
 to say he has encountered problems with the same system:
 “The average older person with hearing loss as well stands no
 chance. I had 10 attempts and never found it would work. I
 suspect it’s not me, it’s their system.
</p>
<p> 
 “There is a growing problem of lip service as has been
 mentioned before. Nobody understands the issues and says
 they comply but who actually tests it with a real blind person?”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Is It Best To Go Mainstream?By Donna Jodhan.
</h3>
<p> 
 The topic of which is better – special access technology
 designed specifically for use by disabled people, or
 mainstream technology that is made accessible and used by
 everyone – is very near and dear to my heart.
</p>
<p> 
 To put things into perspective: access technology is generally
 much more expensive than its mainstream counterpart and
 much less available on the market. It can also be extremely
 challenging to have access technology repaired, compared with
 mainstream technology.
</p>
<p> 
 There are far fewer manufacturers of access technology
 hardware and far fewer developers of access technology
 software, than of mainstream products.
</p>
<p> 
 The profit to be made for those who develop and sell access
 technology is much less than for those who do the same for
 mainstream technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Access technology has to be developed in such a way as to
 adapt to the mainstream world.
</p>
<p> 
 Those are the key issues. Now, where do we go from here?
</p>
<p> 
 About 18 months ago, I bought a PDA (personal digital
 assistant) that was developed for blind people; a real find for
 me and one that I found to be really forward thinking because
 of its features. A few weeks ago, I was told that this PDA will
 no longer be manufactured and as of June 2012, no more
 hardware maintenance agreements would be available.
 Accessories will still be available as long as supplies last. That
 was quite a shock and now we are all left holding the bag, so to
 speak.
</p>
<p> 
 I am not going to identify the manufacturers of this wonderful
 product but suffice it to say that it has made me rethink how I
 go about choosing my mobile devices. Do I continue to buy
 access technology that is extremely expensive and one that I
 am not sure will be around for too long? Or do I move towards
 the mainstream world?
</p>
<p> 
 Do I expose myself to heartbreak if I continue to buy these
 pieces of access technology only to learn that in a short space
 of time they are off the market and no more supplies of
 accessories or support is no longer available? Should we as
 blind people continue to put up with such factors as
 unaffordability, unavailability, and inadequate support? Or is it
 time for us to start embracing the world of Apple and thank the
 late Steve Jobs for having taken that big step to make all of his
 devices like the iPad and iPhone accessible to us?
</p>
<p> 
 Android devices are also out there for the exploring, and of
 course there are other tablets and mobile devices out there that
 are becoming more accessible to us. There are ever more
 choices to help us join the mainstream technology world.
</p>
<p> 
 The landscape is rapidly changing and who knows for how
 long the manufacturers of JAWS Screen Reader, Window-Eyes
 and other types of access technology be able to hold on to their
 respective turfs? Only time will tell.
</p>
