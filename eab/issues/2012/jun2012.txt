++Section One: News.

+01: Launch for National Accessibility Awareness Campaign.

Go ON Gold, a new national campaign to raise awareness
about the barriers faced by disabled people in accessing
modern technologies, from the internet to smartphones and
digital TV, was launched this week by a consortium of partners
lead by Headstar, the publisher of E-Access Bulletin.

Running for a year from summer 2012 to summer 2013, Go
ON Gold is being launched ahead of the London Paralympics
to capitalise on a stronger- than-usual public focus on disability
issues.

At the project’s core is a partnership between the UK’s major
e-accessibility players including the new national digital
inclusion charity Go ON UK led by Martha Lane Fox, the UK
government’s Digital Champion. Other partners include
Headstar; AbilityNet, the UK’s leading charity on access to IT;
BCS; the UK’s national blindness charity RNIB; Disability
Rights UK (formerly RADAR), an umbrella group of other
major charities; and the Equality and Human Rights
Commission. The project is funded by Nominet Trust.

A series of video interviews with leading figures in the
disability community – including Paralympic athletes – are
being created for the campaign, about how access to new
technologies has transformed their lives. All organisations and
individuals invited to embed the videos in their own site. The
Go ON Gold website also intends to act as a signpost to all the
best accessibility resources elsewhere on the web.

Any organisation can sign up to become a Go ON Gold
partner. For more information, see:

+02: New Resources Promote Inclusive e-Learning.

Two free new learning resources have been released by JISC
TechDis, a education advisory service on accessible and
inclusive technology, to boost skills for learners with and
without disabilities.

The first resource will help learners who use text-to-speech
applications: two new voices for text-to-speech were
commissioned from specialists CereProc available for free to
learners and learning institutes.

The male and female voices – named “TechDis Jack” and
“TechDis Jill” – are designed to be easy to understand,
“youthful and modern”. TechDis Jill possesses a Northern
English accent, which its creators believe is a first in text-to-
speech.

According to the TechDis website, “all staff and learners over
16 in every publicly-funded learning provider in England
should be eligible for the TechDis Voices”, which can be
downloaded after registering: http://bit.ly/LfKoz3 .

The second project to be launched was the JISC TechDis
Toolbox ( http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/tbx/ ), with information
to help people use ICT and online technologies more
effectively in employment.

This information is divided into five main categories: ‘using
technology’, ‘planning and organisation’, ‘communicating’,
‘teamworking’, and ‘different needs?’ It includes guidance on
how to carry out effective Google searches; and how to operate
text-to-speech on some mobile devices.

The resources were launched at ND’12, the seventh national
digital inclusion conference, held in London last month. In a
launch video, Alistair McNaught of JISC TechDis said: “We
spent eight years working with learning providers from the top
down, helping to influence senior management teams,
librarians, learning support staff, tutors, etc, and telling them
about the kinds of tools and technology that could make a
difference to their learners.

“But while that was fantastic in some areas, in many places it
just wasn’t trickling down to the learner, so we decided to flip
it over and work form the learner upwards. The whole point of
the Toolbox is to take all the things you wish your tutor might
have told you about but never did, and take that to learners
directly.”

The work was funded by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills.

+03: Appeal Court Upholds Canadian Woman’s Web Access
Case.

A blind accessibility consultant who took the Canadian Federal
Government to court over the inaccessibility of its websites has
won a second victory, after the Canadian Federal Court of
Appeal upheld an initial decision in her favour.

Canadian citizen Donna Jodhan, who is blind, won her first
case against the government in 2010, after claiming that her
rights were breached when she could not apply for a
government job online or complete an online census form
using screen-reader technology. The government then appealed
the decision (see E-Access Bulletin issue 133:
http://bit.ly/hNcwT4 ), continuing a long legal battle.

In its defence, the Canadian Government had claimed the case
should be thrown out since the information was available to
Jodhan by other means – by telephone, post or in person.
However, the appeal court has now upheld Jodhan’s 2010
victory, which included a ruling that the Canadian Government
must make its websites accessible for blind and visually
impaired citizens within 15 months.

Jodhan told E-Access Bulletin she was “absolutely delighted,
humbled, and relieved that this decision has been handed
down.” She said: “It is my sincere hope that the Canadian
government will now take the initiative to work with our
community to ensure that the court’s ruling is adhered to in full
and in the spirit that it was meant to be. Now we need to build
on this and use this as a launching pad for creating more
awareness and to encourage all stake holders to work together
for a common goal.”

In a press statement about the ruling, a spokesperson for the
Federal Government said: “Our government is continuing to
implement the Federal Court decision from 2010. We are
committed to web accessibility and to date over 100
government institutions are converting their content in line with
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.”

++News in Brief:

+04: Case Resolved: A legal dispute between the Royal
National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and bmibaby over
the alleged inaccessibility of the low-cost airline’s website to
visually impaired customers has been settled. The legal action
was taken by RNIB earlier this year, after the organisation had
audited bmibaby’s websites following complaints from blind
and visually impaired customers and made recommendations
which were not acted on. In a statement approved by both
parties, bmibaby apologised to its blind and visually impaired
customers and said it is committed to rectifying remaining
accessibility issues on its website:

+06: Parliamentary Briefing: A briefing for UK
Parliamentarians on the barriers disabled people face in
accessing and using ICT, and what can be done to remove
some of these barriers, has been published by the
Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology. To support
the document a seminar, ‘ICT for Disabled People’, will take
place in the Houses of Parliament on 5 July, featuring field
experts talking about the transforming potential of technology,
and how ICT can be made more accessible. All are welcome:

+07: Inaccessibility Blacklist: A new Italian web portal is
naming and shaming websites and applications throughout the
country that are inaccessible to blind and visually impaired
computer users. The project, called ‘Titengodocchio’ in Italian
(translated as “I am keeping an eye on you”) has been created
by a 17-year-old blind technical student, Vincenzo Rubano,
who collects reports from users, verifies them and enters
upheld claims onto a ‘blacklist’ of inaccessible websites. Sites
featured so far include the Italian National Institute for
Statistics; the iPad version of Google Analytics; and the iPhone
version of Skype:

++Section Two: 'The Inbox'
- Readers' Forum.

Please email all contributions or responses to:
inbox@headstar.com .


+07: Commission Responds: Clive Lever, Diversity and
Equality Officer at Kent County Council, wrote in to bemoan
the apparent inaccessibility of aspects of an email newsletter
from an organisation that should be setting the standard:
“Please can you advise on the best way that we may be able to
persuade the Equality and Human Rights Commission (of all
people) to send out newsletters that conform to accessibility
standards? For instance, three links in a row that say "read
more" doesn't seem the best example to be setting.”

After receiving the query from E-Access Bulletin, Jean Irvine
OBE, Equality and Human Rights Commissioner, raised the
matter internally and writes back to inform us of progress.

She writes: “I have checked this with the web site manager who
has asked me to thank you for bringing this to our attention
[and we are] working to resolve this. We now provide an
alternative plain text version, as the e-newsletter is sent out as a
MIME message, in otherwords it contains a message sent in
both plain text and HTML. Recipients receive one version or
the other depending on how their mailbox is set up.

“We also publish the newsletter on our website in an accessible
format:
http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/publications/email-
newsletter/previous-editions/
Short link: http://bit.ly/KdvVEw .

“We are now looking at the links themselves, replacing the
‘read more’ description with more relevant and accurate link
text descriptions.”

+08: Television Continuation: Phil Smalley, a reader from
Leicestershire who is blind, writes in to add to last issue’s
comments from reader Nigel Timbrell on a move by Panasonic
to build text-to-speech functionality into 30 of its TV models.
Nigel had welcomed this move, but said: “My concern would
be how many people who need this facility are going to go out
and purchase a brand-new TV set?”

Phil replies: “While I appreciate Nigel’s comments about
existing users not having the resources to go out and purchase
£430+ TV sets in order to benefit from the new technology,
unfortunately, this is the way of technical advances – wouldn’t
it be good to have “start-stop” technology fitted to your old
banger rather than going out and purchasing a new model!

“No, the exciting thing about the Panasonic development is that
it’s mainstream. This means those who need to purchase a new
TV and require text to speech technology can go to the high
street for a demonstration or purchase the best price online.
Additionally, more exciting than a mere set-top box, the
Panasonic range can enable sight-impaired people to record
and retrieve programmes.

“Ideally, other manufacturers will follow suit and then when
you, as a sight-impaired person, want to purchase a TV with
text to speech, there will be far greater choice in facilities,
quality and price.”

Phil concludes: “So thank you, Panasonic, for taking the lead.
Sadly I won’t be rushing out and purchasing at the moment as
I’ve just given up on my speech-enabled Freeview box as
stuttering speech, automatic turning off of audio description
and freezing/locking up have finally got the better of me, and I
have switched to Freesat.”

Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, who is on the committee
of the Kingston upon Thames Association for the Blind, writes
in to add his perspective to the debate on talking TVs – and
talking home appliances in general.

“About talking domestic appliances: the history of these is not
a good one. I recall in the late 1970s or early 1980s, Sharp had
a talking video. Nobody seemed to buy it so they stopped
making it. Admittedly, the voice was rather robotic. And what
happened to the talking DAB radio by Pure?

“I'd like to see the same technology as on the Panasonics used
on stereo systems and so on. But in a few years’ time, will
anyone still be making voice-assisted units?”

++Section Three: Conference report
eAccess ’12.

+10: Time To Be Creative
by Tristan Parker.

A more creative, inclusive approach to accessibility is needed
than simply following technical guidelines, delegates heard at
the eAccess 12 conference co-hosted this week by E-Access
Bulletin publisher Headstar.

David Sloan of the Digital Media Access Group at Dundee
University said his university’s School of Computing had
integrated user feedback into all aspects of its work, from the
building’s open design to recruitment of local elderly people to
come in and participate in research.

“Involving people who benefit from the skills you’re teaching
is critical, rather than just presenting people with guidelines like
WCAG and using that in an assessment”, Sloan said.

Paul Edwards, programme manager for Channel 4’s online
coverage of the upcoming Paralympic Games, agreed that
sticking too rigidly to accessibility guidelines can have a
detrimental effect on your audience. Flexibility is crucial: “The
most important thing we’ve been trying to do is make sure our
process is flexible enough to react when a situation occurs.
When you’re looking at guidelines like WCAG, sticking too
closely to them actually blinkers you to what’s happening to
your users.”

Henny Swan, senior accessibility specialist for iPlayer and
mobile at BBC Technology, said modern developers should
ensure a website responds to the device it is being viewed on,
including smartphones and mobile devices: “responsive
design”.

However, designing accessible content for mobile devices is
still tough due to a lack of authoritative guidelines on the
subject, Swan said. This led to Swan and her team at the BBC
developing their own specialist guidelines for accessible BBC
mobile content: “We decided to write guidelines for HTML,
Android and iOS (the iPhone operating system), because those
are our three biggest areas. We needed ‘device-agnostic’
guidelines, rather than writing three different sets.”

The result is ‘Mobile and tablet accessibility guidelines and
techniques’ – an internal BBC guide for developers, designers
and project managers when creating mobile content. Guidance
includes ‘supporting device capabilities’, which states that
content must try not to break specific device accessibility. An
example of this is the ‘pinch’ zoom function on the iOS, said
Swan, which allows users to magnify content with a small
finger gesture on the screen. “If you’re coding in HTML you
can suppress ability for user to do that, immediately preventing
a lot of people being able to read content quickly and easily.
Don’t suppress what the device allows you to do.”
