<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Apps Risk Creating New World Of Exclusion, Reportfinds.
</h3>
<p> 
 Developers of mobile apps must build in “as much choice,
 adaptability and flexibility as possible” to their products to
 maximise accessibility for disabled people, or risk creating a
 whole new world of digital exclusion, a new report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Moving together: mobile apps for inclusion and assistance’ (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/yBTdwo">http://bit.ly/yBTdwo</a>
 ) was written by E-Access Bulletin editor Dan Jellinek with Peter Abrahams of Bloor Research, on
 behalf of the OneVoice for Accessible IT Coalition.
</p>
<p> 
 The report details a number of key issues facing elderly and
 disabled users of mobile apps, and makes recommendations
 for improving the accessibility of such apps.
</p>
<p> 
 One emerging area in the field is that of apps for assistance
 which use ‘crowdsourcing’ to assist users, the report found.
 These are apps which draw on the knowledge base of a group
 to provide information or help to other users, such as the
 iPhone app VizWiz, which allows users to take a photo of
 something, record a question about the picture, and then
 ‘crowdsource’ the answer from a team of online workers.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin, Peter Abrahams, co-author of
 the report, said accessible apps could enable disabled users “to
 be independent in ways they could not be in the non-digital
 environment.” However, “if the app is not accessible then the
 disabled person will be disenfranchised and marginalised. This
 is morally, ethically, financially and legally unacceptable”,
 Abrahams said.
</p>
<p> 
 Mobile device retailers should ensure sales staff have training
 in basic disability awareness and use of the Global
 Accessibility Reporting Initiative (GARI) database, run by the
 Mobile Manufacturers Forum ( <a href="http://bit.ly/reiCg">http://bit.ly/reiCg</a>
 ), to provide customers with accessibility information, the report says.
</p>
<p> 
 The report was launched last month at the inaugural Annual
 General Meeting of the One Voice for Accessible ICT
 Coalition, a collection of private, public and third sector groups
 committed to helping businesses and organisations improve
 their ICT accessibility. At the meeting, coalition members
 signed a set of principles detailing their commitment to
 promote and increase the uptake and delivery of accessible
 online and mobile services.
</p>
<p> 
 The coalition has also drawn-up a ‘Seven Steps’ guide to basic
 mobile app accessibility for app designers and implementers:
 <a href="http://bit.ly/yL8iaZ">http://bit.ly/yL8iaZ</a>

</p>
<p> 
 All these steps are designed to help overcome the idea that
 accessibility is too complicated, Abrahams said. “They also
 emphasise the fact that accessibility is not just about getting the
 technical coding right, but goes right through the cycle from
 commissioning to dealing with feedback.”

<h3 id="i147-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Publishers Call For Cohesion On Accessible E-Books.</h3>
<p> 
 A pledge on behalf of the publishing industry to work with all
 parts of the publishing supply chain to improve the
 accessibility of e-books has been launched by The Publishers
 Association (PA), with cross-sector support.
</p>
<p> 
 The joint statement ( <a href="http://bit.ly/HzaaBV">http://bit.ly/HzaaBV</a>
 ) was launched at this week’s London Book Fair 2012, and is supported by a range of
 organisations, including: the Royal National Institute of Blind
 People; and EDItEUR, the international trade standards body
 for the book industry.
</p>
<p> 
 While technological advancements have made it easier for
 publishers to produce material that is more accessible to those
 with print impairments, the whole supply chain now needs to
 work together to advance e-book accessibility, the statement
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 “The mechanisms by which an ebook is made accessible
 involve all the actors in the supply chain from author to reader;
 no single actor in that chain can solve the challenge of
 accessibility by itself. Publishers, ebook device manufacturers,
 platform developers, ebook wholesalers and retailers, and of
 course consumers themselves all have their part to play”, it
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 Publishers are now looking to work with: developers of e-book
 devices and platforms; e-book retailers; learning providers and
 libraries; and readers with print impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 The PA is asking organisations in all parts of the publishing
 supply chain, and others interested organisations, to pledge
 their support to the statement, which they can do through the
 PA’s website ( <a href="http://bit.ly/I7NIfZ">http://bit.ly/I7NIfZ</a>
 ). The association has also produced its own recommendations on accessible publishing
 and text-to-speech ( <a href="http://bit.ly/ApJbsd">http://bit.ly/ApJbsd</a>

<h3 id="i147-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Digital Exclusion For Older People 'Set To Continue'.</h3>
<p> 
 Today’s technologically-skilled young people are likely to face
 significant web accessibility problems as they grow older,
 similar to those faced by elderly computer users today, a
 professor of computing has said.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin ahead of his talk at this week’s
 W4A web accessibility conference in Lyon, France (
 <a href="http://www.w4a.info/2012/">http://www.w4a.info/2012/</a>
 ), Alan F. Newell, an emeritus professor at Dundee University’s School of Computing, said
 that he has “every expectation” that today’s young people will
 face problems using the web in the future, even if they
 currently have good computer skills. This will arise from their
 declining abilities (such as poorer eyesight, poorer cognition,
 poorer dexterity) struggling to cope with constant technological
 evolution, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 To counter these problems web designers must take into
 account the challenges that face elderly people – which they
 are not currently doing, Newell said. “Design is all about
 working to constraints, but web designers don’t see [challenges
 faced by elderly people] as a constraint they’re prepared to
 tackle.”
</p>
<p> 
 To help tackle the problem web designers should meet older
 computer users to find out more about the problems they face,
 Newell said. This would help designers to create sites that are
 used more easily by older people, which, in turn, would
 increase usability for everyone, following principles of
 universal design, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Although older people are commonly seen as technologically
 inept, it is, in fact, the design flaws of the web which make it
 unusable by elderly people and other digitally disadvantaged
 groups, Newell said.
</p>
<p> 
 Drawing on lessons from his book published last year, ‘Design
 and the digital divide’, Newell said the issues faced by older
 people are different from those faced by younger computer
 users with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “There has been significant work done on accessibility of
 websites for disabled people, but this tends to be focused on
 relatively young, highly motivated people with a single
 disability, but if you look at older people, they usually have
 multiple minor disabilities.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>A Comment Onto Our Eab Live Discussion Website Following
Our March Story “Uk’S First Inbuilt Text-To-Speech Tvs Hit
The Shelves”, Detailing A Move By Panasonic To Build Text-To-
Speech Functionality Into 30 Of Its Tv Models, Making Them The
First Such Tvs Available On The Uk General Market.
</h3>
<p> 
 “It can be only a step in the right direction from Panasonic in
 putting in text-to-speech software into their TV sets”, writes
 Timbrell. “My concern would be how many people who need
 this facility are going to go out and purchase a brand-new TV
 set? It would be interesting to see if Panasonic can fit a
 component into existing TV sets to enable text-to-speech in our
 own TV sets instead of going out to purchase a new one.”
</p>
<p> 
 The position is similar with the release of a new talking
 Freeview set-top box from RNIB, he says – those people who
 have already bought a Freeview box which is not accessible
 will be at a disadvantage. “It seems discrimination to those
 disabled people who had no choice [but] to make do what was
 available at that time, but [are] not allowed to have what is
 available today under the similar system.”
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile another reader, Luca Davanzo, comments on the
 same story: “Great news! I wonder if text to speech will be
 available for other languages than English, and when... and [it]
 would be useful to know the exact TV models with [text to
 speech] enabled... any hint?”
</p>
<p> 
 [Editor’s note: Nigel Prankard from Panasonic has kindly listed
 the Panasonic model ranges which include the text-to-speech
 functionality in a comment on the web version of our story –

 .
</p>
<p> 
 With regard to text-to-speech TVs being available in other
 languages, Prankard said: “There is no plan to add any
 additional languages for our 2012 model range. The problem
 with additional languages is the memory required to support the
 language library. Panasonic is considering if this can be
 addressed in future models. We would like to receive input on
 European languages that we should consider for future models.
 In addition, we would like to understand if the user would
 consider it a problem if they had to download a language via
 an SD card into the TV set to replace a default language.”]

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Do People With Chronic Conditions Make Greatentrepreneurs?
By Julie Howell
</h3>
<p> 
 Consider this: does having a long-term illness have any
 advantages?
</p>
<p> 
 I’ve been living with multiple sclerosis since age 19. Until
 recently, I worked for other people, evangelising about the
 many benefits of web accessibility. Following redundancy in
 2010, I found myself at another of life’s crossroads. Should I
 find another job, or take the road less travelled and start my
 own business? I plumped for the latter and I haven’t looked
 back.
</p>
<p> 
 Recently, I was asked to address a networking meeting
 attended by local entrepreneurs. Never having had the desire to
 scale a mountain or swim with sharks, some ‘thinking outside
 of the box’ was required.
</p>
<p> 
 What is ‘good’ about have a chronic condition and are there
 any reasons why having a long-term illness might make a
 person a good entrepreneur? I came up with seven of them.
</p>
<p> 
 1: Illness sets parameters.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the hardest things about working for yourself is
 learning to focus on your goals without a boss standing over
 you. Living with a long-term illness is all about focus –
 focusing on what you can do, not what you can’t. Having
 periods of ‘down time’ when I cannot work places a premium
 on the time when I can work and ‘good time’ is never wasted.
</p>
<p> 
 2: We’ve learned to forgive ourselves.
</p>
<p> 
 It surprises me how difficult some people find it to forgive
 themselves for their mistakes. Business is all about learning
 from mistakes and moving on, so if you struggle to forgive
 yourself for making a mistake, the chances are you will also
 struggle in business. When you live with a chronic condition, a
 major feature of which is crippling fatigue, you learn pretty
 fast that time and energy spent feeling guilty about it is time
 and energy wasted.
</p>
<p> 
 3: The 4-hour week is no longer just a dream.
</p>
<p> 
 ‘Work smarter, not harder’ is the entrepreneurs’ mantra and
 they dream of achieving the elusive ‘four-hour working week’.
 I joke a little here – many of us with chronic conditions can
 only manage four hours of work a week... and you’d be
 amazed how much you can pack in when that’s all the time
 you have (Parkinson’s Law)! I call this ‘living the dream’.
</p>
<p> 
 4: We never waste time.
</p>
<p> 
 People procrastinate. I’m sure you’ve worked with someone
 who can’t make a decision. Making decisions is something I
 find very easy. They may not always be the right decisions but
 in business, that’s not what’s important. If you get something
 wrong, dust yourself down and try again. Time is a precious
 commodity – don’t waste it through indecision.
</p>
<p> 
 5: We work hours others won’t.
</p>
<p> 
 I work when I’m at my most lucid and alert, which tends to be
 in the afternoon and evening. Being happy to work evenings
 means I can pick up work others find less convenient.
</p>
<p> 
 6: We deflect hurtful remarks.
</p>
<p> 
 People let things other people say get to them far too often.
 Everyone with a chronic condition has had to deal with stupid
 remarks. Learning to deflect crass comments without being
 negatively affected by them is important, as time spent
 ruminating would be better spent doing just about anything
 else.
</p>
<p> 
 7: We say ‘no’ without guilt.
</p>
<p> 
 Guilt is exhausting. Learning to accept our limitations and say
 ‘no’, so we can say ‘yes’ more often to the important things, is
 just good business sense. If every entrepreneur did the same I
 reckon they would be more successful for it.
</p>
<p> 
 I bet there are more reasons why people with chronic
 conditions can make great entrepreneurs. Isn’t it time to
 celebrate what we’re good at and remind ourselves of our
 numerous strengths, even – or maybe especially - in the face of
 adversity? The entrepreneurs I spoke to seemed inspired: job
 done.
