<h3 id="i151-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Internet Use Cuts Depression In Elderly, Study Finds.</h3>
<p> 
 Elderly people who regularly use the internet are less likely to
 suffer from depression, new research from a US university has
 found.
</p>
<p> 
 The research, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham,
 found that regular internet usage in retired Americans aged 50
 and older reduced depression by 20-28% and helped promote
 mental well-being among this group.
</p>
<p> 
 The definition of regular internet use was based on people’s
 own answers to the question: “Do you regularly use the World
 Wide Web, or the Internet, for sending and receiving e-mail or
 for any other purpose…?”) and depression was classified by
 the ‘eight-item version’ of the Center for Epidemiologic
 Studies’ Depression Scale – a commonly used method for
 measuring depression.
</p>
<p> 
 “Internet use and depression among older adults” was
 compiled by Shelia Cotten, George Ford, Sherry Ford and
 Timothy Hale using existing data from a survey covering both
 internet usage and health among US adults aged 50 and older,
 conducted as part of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
 an ongoing study into ageing by the University of Michigan.
</p>
<p> 
 The University of Alabama at Birmingham study notes that
 much prior research on the relationship between internet use
 and depression among older adults has been based “on small
 samples, which limit the statistical sophistication and the
 robustness of the findings”. The HRS sample was larger,
 surveying 7,839 older adults who are retired and not living in a
 nursing home.
</p>
<p> 
 The new research concludes: “Internet use reduces the
 probability of a depression categorization for older adults by
 about 20%–28%. The effects of Internet use on depression are
 large and positive, resolving, at least to some extent, the lack of
 evidence supporting the Internet’s impact on depression among
 older adults.”
</p>
<p> 
 Dr Cotten told E-Access Bulletin that the most important
 finding of this study is that “there is a strong and robust effect
 of Internet usage on depression. What this means is that
 regardless of the statistical analysis techniques used, internet
 users were 20%-28% less likely to be classified as depressed.
 This suggests that we should be encouraging more older adults
 to become Internet users.”
</p>
<p> 
 Dr Cotten said other research she has conducted in this area
 shows that “using the internet provides a way for older adults
 to find information, garner resources, and communicate with
 members of their social networks. The ability to stay in touch
 with others and find support when needed are likely
 responsible for the beneficial impacts of Internet use on mental
 health among older adults.”

<h3 id="i151-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Dotcom Maps Out European Disability Laws.</h3>
<p> 
 A searchable online database of laws, policies, strategies and
 initiatives upholding the rights of people with disabilities has
 been launched to measure how well European nations are
 implementing the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons
 with Disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 “DOTCOM: the Disability Online Tool of the Commission” (
 <a href="http://www.disability-europe.net/dotcom">http://www.disability-europe.net/dotcom</a>
 ) has been developed by the Academic Network of European
 Disability Experts (ANED) – in collaboration with the
 European Commission and EU Member States – building on
 the commission’s European Disability Strategy 2010-20.
</p>
<p> 
 The information, taken from 34 countries, is organised into
 eight themes: UN convention status; general legal framework;
 accessibility; independent living; education; employment;
 statistics and data collection; and awareness and external
 action.
</p>
<p> 
 Data can be searched by country, group of countries, theme or
 sub-category – for example the three sub-categories of
 accessibility law are transport accessibility; built environment
 accessibility; ICT and web accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Searching for the UK’s ICT accessibility laws and policies
 brings up the following results, including information on the
 Equality Act 2010 and the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines:

<h3 id="i151-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: “Smart Tvs” To Be Scrutinised For Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility features for “connected TVs” or “smart TVs” –
 television sets which can access internet content – are being
 examined by a working group from the Digital TV Group
 (DTG), the UK’s industry association for digital television.
</p>
<p> 
 The work will include an updating of guidelines first published
 in a 2011 TV usability document from the DTG usability
 group, which has been renamed the accessibility group to
 incorporate wider interests.
</p>
<p> 
 “The UK Digital TV Usability and Accessibility Guidelines” –
 nicknamed the U-Book – offer advice for manufacturers of
 digital TV receiving equipment on how to incorporate
 accessibility features into their products, including audio
 description services and text-to-speech conversion. The DTG
 accessibility group will be updating the U-Book in the autumn
 to include internet content on TVs.
</p>
<p> 
 “The guidelines are intended to document the best practice for
 supporting accessibility and are there to provide a reference
 tool for industry”, Simon Gauntlett, Technology Director at
 DTG, told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 “Increasingly, we will see the integration of TV services and
 web-based content, and it is essential that, in the development
 of new types of services, accessibility is not compromised.”
</p>
<p> 
 The U-Book is available by email on request from the DTG

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Profile Feature:- Simon Stevens.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: A High Flyer In Two Worldsby Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 Simon Stevens is a high achiever. A manufacturing and
 business graduate of Coventry University, he now works as an
 independent disability consultant, trainer and activist and has
 provided accessibility consultancy to eBay, lectured to students
 at universities, and helped organise and run European youth
 seminars.
</p>
<p> 
 He has even appeared in a Channel 4 TV comedy series, ‘I’m
 Spazticus’ – a new take on the hidden camera prank show –
 which ran in August during the run-up to the Paralympic
 Games and can still be viewed on the channel’s “4oD” online
 catch-up service.
</p>
<p> 
 Stevens, who has cerebral palsy affecting his speech, mobility,
 hand control and balance, is also a techno-wizard. He uses a
 PC, iPad and Lightwriter text to speech communication aid, and
 says such advances have benefited him hugely in day-to-day
 life.
</p>
<p> 
 “Technology enables me to do so many things and to be an
 independent, active citizen”, he says. “Without computers,
 email and internet... I would not be able to work from home, I
 would be more socially isolated, and it would be harder to do
 my banking, my shopping and order takeaways to be delivered.
 Most importantly it would be much harder to have a voice in
 society as a contributing citizen and be able to be heard in the
 way I believe I am.”
</p>
<p> 
 As long-term readers of E-Access Bulletin will also be aware,
 Stevens is also a pioneer in the popular online virtual world
 Second Life, becoming its first full-time virtual wheelchair user
 – meaning his online character or “avatar” is also in a
 wheelchair – when he joined in 2006. “While this felt very
 normal for me, I was unaware of the impact my decision to use
 a wheelchair made on others,” says Simon. “I have been
 interviewed in top mainstream media, like BBC World Service,
 about the issue, and it has been studied and researched by
 people all over the world.”
</p>
<p> 
 Soon after joining, Simon opened ‘Wheelies’, the world’s first
 disability-themed virtual nightclub in Second Life, with the aim
 of it being a friendly and inclusive place for disabled and non-
 disabled people from around the world to meet and have a
 virtual dance to the club’s music. In 2008, Simon was awarded
 the UK Catalyst ‘Revolutionary’ Award by then-Prime Minister
 Gordon Brown for his work on Wheelies.
</p>
<p> 
 Simon believes it is important for people with impairments to
 recognise the solutions that technology can provide, although
 he is aware that cost can be a significant barrier. It can
 expensive to replace a computer or tablet computer that may
 only last several years, with the added difficulty of finding
 reliable repair services when needed, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite this, Simon believes that technology can be a key
 factor for increasing the ability of disabled people to become
 “modern, contributing citizens.” He says: “The internet gives
 everyone direct power over their lives and the ability to express
 themselves… in a way no previous generation has had. The
 technology has its practical difficulties, but it is far more
 accessible in comparison with other methods of
 communication, and therefore is an equaliser for so many
 disabled people.”
</p>
<p> 
 The achievement of which Simon is proudest is his 2004 award
 in the ‘Community’ category of the first Enterprising Young
 Brits Award. “The reason it was my greatest achievement was
 that it was a mainstream competition where I was the only
 disabled finalist, and as someone with a speech impairment
 who has faced a lot of prejudices in my life, it is a true
 recognition of how far technology has enabled me to make a
 difference.”
</p>
<p> 
 As for the future, he says: “I would like to continue to make a
 difference and demonstrate what someone with a significant
 impairment can achieve with the assistance of technology. I
 also look forward to the continuing improvement of
 technology, where we can achieve more and more in a way
 that is easier and easier.”
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Simon is a video champion for Go ON Gold, a new
 national campaign to promote awareness of the barriers
 disabled people face in accessing technology, and help people
 overcome those barriers. The campaign is supported by E-
 Access Bulletin, To find out more, including an exclusive
