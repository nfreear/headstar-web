<h3 id="i144-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Tesco Pledges Action Over Inaccessible App.</h3>
<p> 
 The UK’s largest supermarket chain Tesco has said it is taking
 seriously concerns raised about the inaccessibility of its new
 smartphone app, and is to work with the RNIB to improve the
 situation.
</p>
<p> 
 The statement was issued after E-Access Bulletin raised
 questions with the company about the experiences of Steph
 Cutler, a small business adviser and personal coach who has
 impaired vision. Cutler approached EAB after becoming
 dissatisfied with the new Tesco shopping app and with the
 retailer’s initial response to her complaints.
</p>
<p> 
 “I love the iPhone – it has really changed my life, and on the
 whole, the apps I’ve got are pretty usable,” she said. “So when
 I downloaded the Tesco app I was excited to think I could use
 it to shop – although their website is accessible, I find it very
 time-consuming. But it turns out that the app is totally
 inaccessible with [the iPhone’s screenreader] VoiceOver.
 Basically, the app says the same thing whatever product you
 touch.”
</p>
<p> 
 After Cutler asked the RNIB to take a look and they had
 supported her assessment, she contacted Tesco to complain,
 but says the company’s initial response was unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p> 
 “I emailed them and they rang me back very quickly, but the
 poor lad from customer services just said ‘we know it’s
 inaccessible’, though he didn’t seem to know what that meant.
 He had obviously just been told to call, and he was trying to
 say he accepted it didn’t work, but that it was OK. He also
 categorically refused to let me talk to someone else.
</p>
<p> 
 “I emailed again, and another email came back saying they
 care about accessibility – but with no details of any remedial
 plan.”
</p>
<p> 
 Subsequently, after E-Access Bulletin had made its own
 enquiries into the case, Tesco did produce a fuller response. A
 spokesperson for Tesco said: “The software used in the iPhone
 application is cutting edge technology and we will be always
 aiming to improve the functionality of the application.
</p>
<p> 
 “We have taken the concerns raised seriously and recently
 contacted the RNIB to work with them in identifying features
 that will improve accessibility for the product.
</p>
<p> 
 “At this time, we are unable to give any timescales as to when
 this will be completed. Any amendments to the application will
 need to be built and tested, and will therefore take time to
 complete.”
</p>
<p> 
 Tesco has now also been back in touch with Cutler to relay the
 same message, which she welcomes. “I am hoping they will be
 true to their word, and I do intend to monitor this one,” she
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, she says she still fails to understand why such a large
 company in the 21st century is failing to design in accessibility
 from the first release of a technology offering such as their
 new app.
</p>
<p> 
 “One argument about whether accessibility can be included is
 often resources, and rightly sometimes – but you just can’t say
 that about Tesco,” Cutler says. “We are talking about a massive
 retailer for whom resources aren’t a problem. They understand
 some of it, because they do some of it. It made me, as a
 visually impaired shopper, feel a little bit second class.
</p>
<p> 
 “I do accept apps are new, and the accessibility might change
 in future, but as a user I’m discriminated against.
</p>
<p> 
 “The point I put to them is that at the start of anything, you
 have a choice – you can choose to put accessibility into how it
 will function. But this time, either they briefed a developer and
 they didn’t put any emphasis on accessibility, or the developer
 just didn’t do it. It is far harder for them now – they will have
 to change code, which will be a biggish job. But it wouldn’t be
 a big job if they thought about it as a matter of course and
 didn’t put anything out that most of our customers can’t
 access.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, she says, it is a question of leadership. ““The
 bottom line is I feel as if I’ve been treated less favourably for
 reasons of my disability. It doesn’t feel like it’s been taken
 seriously from the top down – it doesn’t feel like the decision-
 maker has taken an inclusive approach, so why should
 customer service?”

<h3 id="i144-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Global Investment Plan For Cheaper Braille Displays.</h3>
<p> 
 An international plan for disability organisations and others to
 invest in producing a refreshable Braille device hugely cheaper
 than current systems on sale has obtained initial approval from
 the international DAISY consortium for information standards,
 E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The project is being led by the RNIB, which now has until the
 next DAISY board meeting in June to flesh out the plan. If this
 “charter” is passed, investors will be sought to identify and
 back a new device.
</p>
<p> 
 Refreshable Braille devices are made up of individual plastic
 “cells” with a grid of tiny holes through which a small rod rises
 and falls, triggered by an electronic current. A line of cells
 forms into a line of Braille as a computer reads across text.
</p>
<p> 
 As their production process is complex, cells currently cost
 around 100 US Dollars each, and mark-ups are high among the
 few firms which manufacture displays. With typical displays
 carrying 32, 40 and even 80 cells, overall costs soon spiral into
 thousands of dollars.
</p>
<p> 
 Kevin Carey, chair of RNIB, said this month there are already
 currently as many as 34 technical ideas in outline or prototype
 format at universities worldwide, any of which might lead to
 the desired goal of a cheap Braille display roughly the size of a
 stick of rock that could plug into the side of an e-book player.
</p>
<p> 
 “We need to narrow these 34 down to two or three – and
 ideally go down to one - and get massive investment in to bring
 prices down below 25 US Dollars per cell”, Carey said. At the
 moment, no business model had been ruled in or out for
 investment, production and sales, including models requiring
 mass pre-ordering and the involvement of existing major
 incumbent players in the Braille display market.
</p>
<p> 
 Carey first floated the plan in an address to last year’s
 “Braille21” congress hosted by the World Blind Union in
 Leipzig, Germany.
</p>
<p> 
 He told the congress a cheap display would “save massive
 amounts from hard copy Braille production which can be
 ploughed back into expanding the range of files on offer and
 into providing displays cheap or free to individuals.”
</p>
<p> 
 Anticipating complaints about market interference, Carey told
 the Leipzig conference the high prices operated in a similar
 way to a cartel, requiring intervention. “There are some who
 say that organisations of and for the blind should not become
 involved in the access technology market but the current cartel
 does not have an automatic right to exist. For the last 30 years
 of its operations the price of Braille displays has fallen slowly
 when most other consumer electronics prices have plunged.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the very survival of Braille as a language could be
 at stake, he warned. “If Braille is to survive into the 21st
 Century, it will have to re-invent itself as a mass medium,
 simpler, cheaper and easier to render... unless we face up to
 these challenges, Braille will die”.

<h3 id="i144-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Age Alliance Plans Digital Inclusion Knowledge Base.</h3>
<p> 
 A plan to create an online “knowledge base” of resources
 relating to digital inclusion for older people is being drawn up
 by Age Action Alliance, an umbrella group of companies and
 charities led by the Department for Work and Pensions.
</p>
<p> 
 The alliance ( <a href="http://ageactionalliance.org/">http://ageactionalliance.org/</a>
 ), whose members include the BBC, Microsoft, mobile network Three, Age UK
 and the digital inclusion charity for older people Digital Unite,
 has tasked a working group with drawing up a “starter strategy”
 for the knowledge base covering its potential usefulness,
 purpose and viability. It will then make a final decision on
 whether to go ahead with the project at the next meeting of its
 digital inclusion group in February.
</p>
<p> 
 “The aim of the knowledge base is to gather in one place the
 mass of extensive and varied research, analysis and evaluation
 data on activities and projects that have, and still are, delivering
 and facilitating digital literacy for older people”, Emma
 Solomon, managing director of Digital Unite and the groups’
 chair, said this month. “The aim is also to gather – or at least
 signpost – practitioners to a variety of tools and resources that
 can help them deliver or facilitate digital inclusion for older
 people.”
</p>
<p> 
 The knowledge base will be aimed at all practitioners and
 promoters of digital inclusion for older people, Solomon said.
 “These may be formal intermediaries, informal intermediaries
 and individuals as well as organisations and businesses from
 third, private and public sectors.”
</p>
<p> 
 As a separate project, the group also hopes to help co-ordinate
 the promotion of all actions, events and activities that promote
 digital inclusion to older people by creating a searchable
 national database of all campaigns, outreach projects, learning
 and engagement activities in which older people are being
 encouraged and supported to embrace digital technologies, she
 said.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i144-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: European Question:</h3>
<p>  Consultation on the possible creation of a European Accessibility Act has been launched by the
 European Commission. In an accompanying communication,
 the commission defines accessibility as meaning that “people
 with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to
 the physical environment, transportation, information and
 communications including technologies and systems (ICT), and
 other facilities and services in line with Article 9 of the UN
 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities”. It seeks
 to identify which goods and services that should be covered,
 suggesting key areas could include bank cash machines
 (ATMs); health and emergency services; and online services to
 buy public transport services or book tickets for cultural or
 sport events. Provisions of any eventual act could include
 harmonising accessibility requirements across Europe, it says.
 Consultation runs to 29 February 2012, including an online
 questionnaire:

<p>  A new accessible version of the Adobe Digital Editions e-book software reader has been released in a
 trial format. The preview release of Adobe Digital Editions
 1.8.1, which reads e-books created in the popular EPUB open
 standard, works for the first time with the JAWS and NVDA
 screenreaders for Windows and VoiceOver on Mac. It is also
 able to access book content character by character and  word
 by word, and is designed to work with other Windows and
 Apple accessibility features including high contrast. The new
 reader currently lacks some features of its previous version
 1.7, however, such as printing and hardware device support.
 Adobe says future releases will incorporate more of the old
 features while maintaining accessibility improvements:

<p>  David Bates, executive officer at the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) UK, writes in with a
 tale of democratic barriers for screen-reader users.
</p>
<p> 
 “A few weeks ago I received an email from a blind colleague
 inviting me to sign a petition on the UK government e-petitions
 website (<a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/">http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/</a>
)”, Bates says.</p>
<p> 
 “I read the petition, filled in my name and details and was then
 instructed to ‘type in the two words below’. I realised that this
 referred to a graphic ‘captcha’ test which my screen-reader
 could not see, but below was an invitation to open an audio
 challenge instead.
</p>
<p> 
 “Pressing enter started an audio playback with a group of
 people talking overlaid by a voice reading out several words. I
 selected the two clearest words and typed them into the
 required field, but my entry was rejected, as were my 10
 subsequent attempts. I then tried both the “Help” and
 “Accessibility” links and was told how wonderfully accessible
 the website was, but this information didn’t help.
</p>
<p> 
 “I later repeated this story to a sighted colleague who opened
 the site while we were talking on the phone. She said the
 ‘captcha’ text was easy to read but found the audio much more
 difficult to decipher. But she also said that on the page there
 were two links to either replay the audio file or to download it.
 This sounded very useful, but unfortunately my screen-reader
 could not detect these links, so I reluctantly left the site without
 recording my signature.
</p>
<p> 
 “I understand that less than 20% of blind people in the UK are
 able to use a computer, or to visit a national or local
 government website. I wonder what percentage of the general
 public who visit a government website need to use an audio
 captcha, and what percentage of these visually disabled people
 are actually successful?”
</p>
<p>

<p>  Reader G F Mueden from New York, New York writes in to add to our recent discussions about the
 accessibility of Adobe pdf files.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have read about pdf and accessibility, but it is all from the
 creator's point of view,” he writes. “They are not specific about
 what I can do to have the copy suit my eyes.
</p>
<p> 
 “In charity websites I have been offered annual reports in pdf
 and have been unable to read them because I need 2X
 magnification with word wrap for my poor acuity, and choice
 of font for my poor contrast sensitivity. How can the reader tell
 if a file is accessible? If accessible, how do you approach it to
 use the adjustments he needs? As normally presented, what
 you see is not what you would see if you were in the full
 Adobe Reader, it is bare bones with no suggestion of
 accessibility adjustments. My guess is that you save it, leave
 the website, open Reader, then open the pdf. But before doing
 that I want to know if it will be worth the effort. Are they
 marked? Would the copy have to say?
</p>
<p> 
 “I believe that the alternative is to save it and use a file
 converter. I would love to read user experience on this. I don't
 want to complain to the charities, I want to be helpful and let
 them know what they can do to help me without it being a
 burden to them.”

</h3>
<p> 
 On the face of it, Dr Norman Waddington – the holder of not
 just one, but two PhDs – should have what it takes to be
 offered a job interview. But like many disabled people – he is
 blind – this is not proving to be the case.
</p>
<p> 
 Early last year the government launched a programme of
 Incapacity Benefit reassessment, under which recipients of the
 benefit as well – as well as those in receipt of Severe
 Disablement Allowance or Income Support paid on the
 grounds of incapacity – were required to have their eligibility
 reassessed by undergoing a new &quot;Work Capability
 Assessment&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Anyone assessed as capable of working were moved on to Job
 Seekers’ Allowance or - for those with limited capability for
 work - Employment Support Allowance.
</p>
<p> 
 While Waddington accepts this is fair, he says the way the
 system has worked for disabled people is in danger of swinging
 from one extreme to another – from a situation where people
 were left isolated on benefits with no options, to one where
 they are being moved off benefits when the work may not be
 there.
</p>
<p> 
 “When I was pushed onto it at the age of 34, it was a bitter pill
 to swallow to be told you weren’t fit to work, when you knew
 you were. Now the tables have turned – they want people off
 incapacity benefit and back onto Employment Support
 Allowance and back into work. If you look at the small print in
 the DWP stuff, it seems you are likely to get benefit cuts after
 six months, but it’s not clear. The Jobcentre people don’t know
 what’s going on.”
</p>
<p> 
 Waddington has not worked since 1993, when he was made
 redundant from a white collar post at the Sellafield nuclear
 plant. Since then he has done some voluntary work, and
 looked for other jobs sporadically but since the benefit changes
 in Easter has been searching intensively.
</p>
<p> 
 “I must receive 1,000 job list emails a week now, people don’t
 realise the time it takes to plough through them with a screen
 reader,” he says. But despite having applied for some 800 jobs
 in that time, and despite his PHDs – in biodiversity science and
 clinical animal behaviour – he is yet to be shortlisted for any
 post.
</p>
<p> 
 “You get a bog-standard letter, saying you’re not successful on
 this occasion – they don’t say why. It’s soul-destroying. These
 email lists with jobs – sighted people can scan down them
 quickly, but we’ve got to go down it and read it all – people
 have no knowledge of the time it takes. And the time it takes to
 do an application, to use a screen-reader, cutting and pasting –
 for someone who didn’t have the computer knowledge I do it
 would be impossible.
</p>
<p> 
 “It’s as if they’re not aware of the time and effort it takes.
 They don’t want to know or they don’t want to know. And if
 you put it all in a covering letter, explaining about Access to
 Work, it’s as if they just throw your application out – though I
 can’t prove that’s the case.”
</p>
<p> 
 It is now up to the government to work out how to make the
 system fairer, he said.”They need to close the loopholes. The
 classic is the two-tick system, by which if an applicant meets
 the job criteria and is disabled, they are bound by law to give
 you an interview. So they just don’t shortlist you, they say you
 don’t meet criteria. Something needs to be done.”
</p>
<p> 
 The problems don’t stop there –applying for jobs in the first
 place can be made all but impossible by inaccessible online
 forms for job applications, he says. Recently he encountered a
 problem with an online application form on a local authority
 site, for example, which featured a visual icon to call up an
 interactive calendar for applicants to select dates such as start
 dates and end dates of previous jobs.
</p>
<p> 
 “Using JAWS for windows, you can’t access it. They very
 grudgingly sent me a word copy of an application form, but
 how accessible that will be, I’m not sure. They say they can’t
 accept a CV and a covering letter for application, even though
 under the Disability Discrimination Act you have an obligation
 to find an alternative method. The Jobcentre people say this is
 wrong, but I think half the forms I send are not getting to the
 people they should be. If they’re not meeting the admin
 criteria, they’re just scrapped.”
</p>
<p> 
 The Jobcentre itself is not providing enough information in
 accessible formats either, Waddington says. “People could
 possibly lose benefit, because it says in the small print you can
 lose &pound;26 a week after six months. I went on it in September, so
 after March I could lose benefit if I don't turn up for the
 Jobcentre interviews, or take up any placements they offer. But
 you don’t get this information in a format you can read.
</p>
<p> 
 “After my last Jobcentre interview, they said do I want a typed
 transcript – I said I couldn’t see it, can you email it to me?
 They said no, their computer system doesn’t talk to the
 internet. Then they gave me a whole load of leaflets I can't see
 – I had asked for Braille, but it’s not available.”
</p>
<p> 
 Undeterred, Waddington says he will carry on trying to find
 work. “Obviously if I can get back into work I will get back
 into work. You can't let it get to you – you’ve just got to keep
 on trying.”

 The site has recently been redesigned and the forum system
 improved. This is still ongoing and you can join in the
 discussions.
</p>
