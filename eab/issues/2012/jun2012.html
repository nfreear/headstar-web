<h3 id="i149-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Launch For National Accessibility Awareness Campaign.</h3>
<p> 
 Go ON Gold, a new national campaign to raise awareness
 about the barriers faced by disabled people in accessing
 modern technologies, from the internet to smartphones and
 digital TV, was launched this week by a consortium of partners
 lead by Headstar, the publisher of E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Running for a year from summer 2012 to summer 2013, Go
 ON Gold is being launched ahead of the London Paralympics
 to capitalise on a stronger- than-usual public focus on disability
 issues.
</p>
<p> 
 At the project’s core is a partnership between the UK’s major
 e-accessibility players including the new national digital
 inclusion charity Go ON UK led by Martha Lane Fox, the UK
 government’s Digital Champion. Other partners include
 Headstar; AbilityNet, the UK’s leading charity on access to IT;
 BCS; the UK’s national blindness charity RNIB; Disability
 Rights UK (formerly RADAR), an umbrella group of other
 major charities; and the Equality and Human Rights
 Commission. The project is funded by Nominet Trust.
</p>
<p> 
 A series of video interviews with leading figures in the
 disability community – including Paralympic athletes – are
 being created for the campaign, about how access to new
 technologies has transformed their lives. All organisations and
 individuals invited to embed the videos in their own site. The
 Go ON Gold website also intends to act as a signpost to all the
 best accessibility resources elsewhere on the web.
</p>
<p> 
 Any organisation can sign up to become a Go ON Gold
 partner. For more information, see:

<h3 id="i149-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Resources Promote Inclusive E-Learning.</h3>
<p> 
 Two free new learning resources have been released by JISC
 TechDis, a education advisory service on accessible and
 inclusive technology, to boost skills for learners with and
 without disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The first resource will help learners who use text-to-speech
 applications: two new voices for text-to-speech were
 commissioned from specialists CereProc available for free to
 learners and learning institutes.
</p>
<p> 
 The male and female voices – named “TechDis Jack” and
 “TechDis Jill” – are designed to be easy to understand,
 “youthful and modern”. TechDis Jill possesses a Northern
 English accent, which its creators believe is a first in text-to-
 speech.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the TechDis website, “all staff and learners over
 16 in every publicly-funded learning provider in England
 should be eligible for the TechDis Voices”, which can be
 downloaded after registering: <a href="http://bit.ly/LfKoz3">http://bit.ly/LfKoz3</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 The second project to be launched was the JISC TechDis
 Toolbox ( <a href="http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/tbx/">http://www.jisctechdis.ac.uk/tbx/</a>
 ), with information to help people use ICT and online technologies more
 effectively in employment.
</p>
<p> 
 This information is divided into five main categories: ‘using
 technology’, ‘planning and organisation’, ‘communicating’,
 ‘teamworking’, and ‘different needs?’ It includes guidance on
 how to carry out effective Google searches; and how to operate
 text-to-speech on some mobile devices.
</p>
<p> 
 The resources were launched at ND’12, the seventh national
 digital inclusion conference, held in London last month. In a
 launch video, Alistair McNaught of JISC TechDis said: “We
 spent eight years working with learning providers from the top
 down, helping to influence senior management teams,
 librarians, learning support staff, tutors, etc, and telling them
 about the kinds of tools and technology that could make a
 difference to their learners.
</p>
<p> 
 “But while that was fantastic in some areas, in many places it
 just wasn’t trickling down to the learner, so we decided to flip
 it over and work form the learner upwards. The whole point of
 the Toolbox is to take all the things you wish your tutor might
 have told you about but never did, and take that to learners
 directly.”
</p>
<p> 
 The work was funded by the Department for Business,
 Innovation and Skills.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Appeal Court Upholds Canadian Woman’S Web Accesscase.
</h3>
<p> 
 A blind accessibility consultant who took the Canadian Federal
 Government to court over the inaccessibility of its websites has
 won a second victory, after the Canadian Federal Court of
 Appeal upheld an initial decision in her favour.
</p>
<p> 
 Canadian citizen Donna Jodhan, who is blind, won her first
 case against the government in 2010, after claiming that her
 rights were breached when she could not apply for a
 government job online or complete an online census form
 using screen-reader technology. The government then appealed
 the decision (see E-Access Bulletin issue 133:
 <a href="http://bit.ly/hNcwT4">http://bit.ly/hNcwT4</a>
 ), continuing a long legal battle.</p>
<p> 
 In its defence, the Canadian Government had claimed the case
 should be thrown out since the information was available to
 Jodhan by other means – by telephone, post or in person.
 However, the appeal court has now upheld Jodhan’s 2010
 victory, which included a ruling that the Canadian Government
 must make its websites accessible for blind and visually
 impaired citizens within 15 months.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan told E-Access Bulletin she was “absolutely delighted,
 humbled, and relieved that this decision has been handed
 down.” She said: “It is my sincere hope that the Canadian
 government will now take the initiative to work with our
 community to ensure that the court’s ruling is adhered to in full
 and in the spirit that it was meant to be. Now we need to build
 on this and use this as a launching pad for creating more
 awareness and to encourage all stake holders to work together
 for a common goal.”
</p>
<p> 
 In a press statement about the ruling, a spokesperson for the
 Federal Government said: “Our government is continuing to
 implement the Federal Court decision from 2010. We are
 committed to web accessibility and to date over 100
 government institutions are converting their content in line with
 the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.”

<h3 id="i149-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Case Resolved:</h3>
<p>  A legal dispute between the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and bmibaby over
 the alleged inaccessibility of the low-cost airline’s website to
 visually impaired customers has been settled. The legal action
 was taken by RNIB earlier this year, after the organisation had
 audited bmibaby’s websites following complaints from blind
 and visually impaired customers and made recommendations
 which were not acted on. In a statement approved by both
 parties, bmibaby apologised to its blind and visually impaired
 customers and said it is committed to rectifying remaining
 accessibility issues on its website:

<p>  A new Italian web portal is naming and shaming websites and applications throughout the
 country that are inaccessible to blind and visually impaired
 computer users. The project, called ‘Titengodocchio’ in Italian
 (translated as “I am keeping an eye on you”) has been created
 by a 17-year-old blind technical student, Vincenzo Rubano,
 who collects reports from users, verifies them and enters
 upheld claims onto a ‘blacklist’ of inaccessible websites. Sites
 featured so far include the Italian National Institute for
 Statistics; the iPad version of Google Analytics; and the iPhone
 version of Skype:

<p>  Our recent discussion of talking TV sets from Panasonic has raised further response. Debbie Payne, customer
 services officer at Herefordshire Council, says: “I'm very
 encouraged by Panasonic's move to introduce the new talking
 TVs. However, I think their longevity will depend on supply
 and demand.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have a Pure DAB radio and I was disappointed to learn that
 it's no longer available. Unfortunately, it's a sad fact of life that
 these accessible products are usually costly and, despite
 extensive publicity by the RNIB, the majority of blind and
 visually impaired consumers are on low incomes and unable to
 afford them.”
</p>
<p> 
 Further to the issue of affordability Tara Alexander, Senior
 Manager – Innovation at RNIB, writes in to promote an
 alternative product created by TVonics, a British manufacturer
 of set top boxes with Ivona, a text-to-speech developer. The
 two have collaborated with RNIB to launch a fully accessible
 Freeview+ digital TV HD recorder usable by blind and partially
 sighted people which retails for &pound;179.95 including VAT.
</p>
<p> 
 “This product might be the answer to some of your readers'
 concerns about the cost of replacing their television with one
 of the Panasonic range of talking televisions”, Alexander
 writes.

<h3 id="i149-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Political Problems:</h3>
<p>  Wendy Sharpe, a reader from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, writes in to relate a problem
 she encountered in receiving information from her MP, David
 Lidington, when she wrote to him with an enquiry about the
 government’s recent draft Communications Data Bill.
</p>
<p> 
 “I recently received an email from my MP with two
 attachments which are “.png” files [an image rather than a text
 format]”, writes Sharpe. “These files are apparently two pages
 of a letter which he sent me in response to my query, but of
 course, they are totally inaccessible to a blind user. I think you
 should know that Parliament is not providing documents which
 everyone can access, thus breaching the Equality Act 2010.”
</p>
<p> 
 After raising the issue with David Lidington’s office, however,
 she received a response which clarified that the MP had simply
 been forwarding a hard copy of a letter he had obtained from
 the minister overseeing the draft Bill, James Brokenshire.
</p>
<p> 
 The note from Victoria Blane, a caseworker for Mr Lidington,
 read: “I am sorry that you were not able to decipher the letter
 that I forwarded to you from James Brokenshire MP regarding
 the government's communication data proposals.
</p>
<p> 
 “A number of constituents contacted Mr Lidington about this
 issue, and he subsequently wrote to the relevant Minister to
 pass on their concerns. He received a hard copy response in
 the post and, as is usual practice, constituents were forwarded a
 scanned version for their reference... I contacted the Home
 Office to request a text only version of the letter which I have
 now received. I have attached a copy and hope it will be of use
 to you.”
</p>
<p> 
 This response was satisfactory so far as the MP is concerned,
 said Sharpe: “It clearly isn't my MP's fault that scanned
 documents are distributed in this way.”
</p>
<p> 
 Ironically, when Sharpe tried to access the draft Bill itself, she
 was directed to a .pdf file which, when she attempted to open
 it, simply read: &quot;empty file&quot;. The link was:
 <a href="http://www.official-">http://www.official-</a>

 documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8359/8359.pdf
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;This is clearly a paper which has been scanned in as images,
 again inaccessible to a blind person,&quot; she said.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Conference reporteAccess ’12.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Time To Be Creativeby Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 A more creative, inclusive approach to accessibility is needed
 than simply following technical guidelines, delegates heard at
 the eAccess 12 conference co-hosted this week by E-Access
 Bulletin publisher Headstar.
</p>
<p> 
 David Sloan of the Digital Media Access Group at Dundee
 University said his university’s School of Computing had
 integrated user feedback into all aspects of its work, from the
 building’s open design to recruitment of local elderly people to
 come in and participate in research.
</p>
<p> 
 “Involving people who benefit from the skills you’re teaching
 is critical, rather than just presenting people with guidelines like
 WCAG and using that in an assessment”, Sloan said.
</p>
<p> 
 Paul Edwards, programme manager for Channel 4’s online
 coverage of the upcoming Paralympic Games, agreed that
 sticking too rigidly to accessibility guidelines can have a
 detrimental effect on your audience. Flexibility is crucial: “The
 most important thing we’ve been trying to do is make sure our
 process is flexible enough to react when a situation occurs.
 When you’re looking at guidelines like WCAG, sticking too
 closely to them actually blinkers you to what’s happening to
 your users.”
</p>
<p> 
 Henny Swan, senior accessibility specialist for iPlayer and
 mobile at BBC Technology, said modern developers should
 ensure a website responds to the device it is being viewed on,
 including smartphones and mobile devices: “responsive
 design”.
</p>
<p> 
 However, designing accessible content for mobile devices is
 still tough due to a lack of authoritative guidelines on the
 subject, Swan said. This led to Swan and her team at the BBC
 developing their own specialist guidelines for accessible BBC
 mobile content: “We decided to write guidelines for HTML,
 Android and iOS (the iPhone operating system), because those
 are our three biggest areas. We needed ‘device-agnostic’
 guidelines, rather than writing three different sets.”
</p>
<p> 
 The result is ‘Mobile and tablet accessibility guidelines and
 techniques’ – an internal BBC guide for developers, designers
 and project managers when creating mobile content. Guidance
 includes ‘supporting device capabilities’, which states that
 content must try not to break specific device accessibility. An
 example of this is the ‘pinch’ zoom function on the iOS, said
 Swan, which allows users to magnify content with a small
 finger gesture on the screen. “If you’re coding in HTML you
 can suppress ability for user to do that, immediately preventing
 a lot of people being able to read content quickly and easily.
 Don’t suppress what the device allows you to do.”
