<h3 id="i153-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessible Design Event Fuels User-Focused Innovation.</h3>
<p> 
 Sensors to help people secure their home and an accessible
 kettle were the winning entries in a recent event that
 encouraged participants to design and build products that are
 usable by everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 Created by accessible design social business and community
 Enabled by Design ( <a href="http://enabledbydesign.org/">http://enabledbydesign.org/</a>

 ), the “Enabled by Design-athon” featured 13 teams designing
 and modifying innovative items.
</p>
<p> 
 “If you have design-for-all as your starting point, it was about
 asking how we can modify things and customise things – how
 can we take advantage of new technology, materials and new
 ways of working to make things more accessible to people?”
 Denise Stephens, Founder of Enabled by Design, told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Running over two days, the event began with sessions to help
 participants understand some of the challenges faced by people
 living with particular impairments, and how they might account
 for these challenges when designing a product.
</p>
<p> 
 Given access to a range of materials and equipment, including
 3D printers, the teams then set about designing their own
 products. Two winners were picked. The first was
 ‘SafeHouse’, a project which tells homeowners if all their
 windows and doors are closed using sensors to complete
 circuits. “Rather than having to go round your whole house and
 check that everything is secure and closed, you could have a
 central panel, which can tell you if there’s a window or door
 open”, said Stephens. “Although SafeHouse could be used by
 anyone as a security feature, it may be particularly useful for
 older people or those with memory difficulties”, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The second winner was ‘Paul’s Kettle’, a device designed for
 an attendee at the event who was born without lower limbs. A
 team designed a lightweight kettle with a jug shape, modified
 handle and pivot, allowing someone with limited mobility to
 easily pick up and pour the kettle.
</p>
<p> 
 The design consultancy and event partner IDEO, will now run
 a session to help the winning groups develop their ideas and
 examine possible methods of acquiring funding for their
 designs. Other partners included: the government’s Technology
 Strategy Board; Ravensbourne, a digital media and design
 higher education institution and the location of the event; the
 public service consultancy FutureGov; and sugru – a self-
 setting rubber which can be moulded and added to items to fix,
 modify and make them easier to use.
</p>
<p> 
 Stephens said that the event had proved particularly useful for
 designers, who found it useful to speak directly to people
 about potential ideas and developing their products. “A
 message [from the Design-athon] would be to really involve
 people from the beginning of the design process. Rather than
 retrofitting something for somebody, why not speak to people
 throughout and use that information to help inspire and
 influence your design?”

<h3 id="i153-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Call For New Task-Based Approach To Digital Inclusion.</h3>
<p> 
 A “change in mind set” on digital inclusion is needed by
 organisations in all sectors after a general failure to create
 accessible digital systems – particularly for those with a
 disability or the elderly – a new report by technology access
 charity AbilityNet says.
</p>
<p> 
 “Mind the Digital Gap: It’s bigger than you think” says that
 although there has been much discussion on accessibility and
 inclusive digital systems over the past 15 years, this has not
 yielded significant results. “The reality is … that apart from a
 small number of good examples, many digital systems and
 content are inaccessible to the majority of disabled and older
 people. The current methodology … has failed and we need a
 change in mind set on how we approach digital inclusion,” it
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 The paper proposes a six-part strategy to help organisations
 develop a more inclusive digital environment and economy.
 This includes the creation of a “support service” to help
 disabled and older people use technology effectively; and
 encouraging business, government and the third sector to work
 toward digital inclusion together through a new forum.
</p>
<p> 
 The paper also stresses the importance of task-based testing –
 examining the achievability of individual tasks – in designing
 inclusive digital services. As an example of how not to do this,
 the report uses the example of an airline website where a user
 is sent back to the beginning of the ticket-buying process if the
 required information is not completed in a certain time. This
 security feature may make it difficult for someone with a
 learning or cognitive impairment to complete the process, and
 an adjustment to the cut-off time would increase usability for
 these groups, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 “We have to recognise that people use technology to complete
 a task, whether that is filling in an online form, buying
 something, looking for information and so on,” Nigel Lewis,
 chief executive of AbilityNet, told E-Access Bulletin. “The
 approach to inclusion and accessibility has [so far] focused on
 piecemeal elements such as alternative text for images rather
 than thinking of what the user is actually trying to achieve”, he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 The new report builds on suggestions made by Kevin Carey,
 chairman of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, in a
 separate discussion paper commissioned by AbilityNet on
 improved consumer access to digital information, “Universal
 citizen and customer access”. Both papers can be downloaded

<h3 id="i153-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Personalisation Is Key To Draft E-Learning Standard.</h3>
<p> 
 Public comment is being invited on a newly updated
 accessibility standard for students and learners, which focuses
 on personalising digital learning resources as a method of
 maximising accessibility for each learner.
</p>
<p> 
 The standard, Access for All version 3.0 (AfA v3.0), is
 produced by IMS Global Learning Consortium, a non-profit
 body whose members include more than 180 leading
 universities, educational organisations and technology
 companies worldwide. It aims to give a personalised
 experience for learners through use of a “common language”
 which describes a learner’s needs and preferences.
</p>
<p> 
 This information is not based around specifics of a learner’s
 medical condition or history, but how the learner interacts with
 digital resources, such as computers. Any specific needs of a
 user – if someone can only operate a computer using a
 keyboard, for example – are recorded, so resources can be
 adapted accordingly.
</p>
<p> 
 Although AfA v3.0 states that “no single resource has to be
 100% accessible to all learners”, flexibility and the potential to
 alter a resource are important to the standard, as they increase
 the chances for personalisation.
</p>
<p> 
 The constituent sections of AfA v3.0 can be viewed on the
 IMS Global website: <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/">http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/</a>
 . Comments about the standard can be left in an IMS public
 forum: <a href="http://bit.ly/QvdjGb">http://bit.ly/QvdjGb</a>

</p>
<p> 
 A free webinar on AfA v3.0, hosted by EASI (Equal Access to
 Software and Information), an organisation that provides
 online training on accessible IT, will take place on 17
 December. To register, visit: <a href="http://easi.cc/clinic.htm#december">http://easi.cc/clinic.htm#december</a>

<h3 id="i153-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Nudge Online:</h3>
<p>  A new report has made a number of suggestions for tackling the digital exclusion of elderly people,
 including for government and the private sector to put more
 emphasis on “co-design” in the technology sector – that is,
 involving older people in the design of online services. The
 report, “Nudge or compel: can behavioural economics tackle
 the digital exclusion of older people?” was produced by the
 International Longevity Centre, a think-tank specialising in
 ageing and population change:

<p>  Our regular correspondent Clive Lever, Diversity and Equality Officer at Kent County Council,
 writes in to respond to the online comment published in our
 last issue from a reader using the pseudonym “Deaf”.
 Following our earlier piece commenting on Channel 4’s failure
 to caption paralympic TV coverage, “Deaf” had written in to
 point out: “There are many qualified stenographers who can
 type at the minimum of 200-220 words per minutes with at
 least 98% accuracy.”
</p>
<p> 
 Now Clive writes in to add: “In the days before word
 processors, many of those stenographers would have been
 blind audiotypists.
</p>
<p> 
 “In these times, when only half of disabled people of working
 age, and only one-fifth of people with visual impairments of
 working age have jobs, is there not potential for a career
 opportunity for blind typists?”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Profile FeatureRo O’Shay
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: The World At My Fingertips</h3>
<p> 
 After training as a clinical support worker, US-based blogger
 Ro O’Shay was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2006,
 before losing her sight in 2008. Since then, the internet and
 new communications technologies have gradually become a
 lifeline for her, and she is now a keen writer and technology-
 user. Tristan Parker talks to her about her passion for
 technology.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Please give us some background on yourself.
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: I grew up sighted in Arizona, without the kinds of
 technology young people grow up with today. I lived at home
 and went to college and eventually decided on phlebotomy [the
 process of collecting blood from patients for examination] as a
 career. In 2006 my right eye went blind and I was diagnosed
 with multiple sclerosis. The internet and my PC quickly
 became my link to the world as I adjusted to suddenly being
 disabled. I became a moderator on a mental health forum and
 that was a huge sense of pride and accomplishment for me.
 When I suddenly became completely blind in 2008, all that
 was taken from me.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: How do you use technology and how does it benefit you?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: I was without technology for eight months when a friend
 gave me an iPod nano. It had spoken menus! I called Apple,
 wondering what else they might have. It was explained to me
 that all their computers had built-in screen readers. I had heard
 about screen readers for Windows but the cost made me ill. I
 went to the Apple store and was able to log in and post on the
 mental health forum using the Mac screen reader, Voiceover. I
 could just afford the least expensive MacBook and began to
 painstakingly teach myself how to use it.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Do you use other technologies - online tools, screen-
 readers, anything else?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: I have an iPhone 4 that, next to my MacBook, is the most
 important piece of technology in my life. I have a typing app
 called Fleksy that really made using my iPhone all the easier
 and I have since gotten an app that scans and reads text, an app
 that scans barcodes and gives me product information, I am
 able to access my bank account with an app, I can listen to
 baseball games when I’m out of the house, I have a GPS app
 that helps me know where I am – the list goes on.
</p>
<p> 
 I’m able to read books with iBooks and I keep audio books
 with me as well, and the calendar app has been a lifesaver. Just
 about every app that comes with an iPhone is accessible and
 even most third party apps are. App developers are becoming
 more and more familiar with Voiceover on all iDevices and a
 lot of them are receptive when the blind and low vision users
 have suggestions for accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: You seem a very prolific writer on your blog. Is this one of
 your main activities when you’re online?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: Blogging used to be one of my main activities online. I
 started my blog after I decided to begin the journey of getting a
 guide dog and that was just another way I began meeting
 people. I met one of the close friends I mentioned earlier
 because of the blog.
</p>
<p> 
 I found other blogs written by people who had lost their vision
 later in life and it helped me feel connected and find others
 like me. I was also helping people without even knowing it,
 and I had this entire fellowship of blind and low-vision people
 grow up around me, as well as puppy raisers and other dog
 people who helped me prepare for my life with a guide dog.
 My blog is very important to me and I recently had to move it
 to WordPress because Blogger made some changes that deeply
 impacted accessibility negatively. I was resistant to the move
 but am now grateful for it.
</p>
<p> 
 While my blog is still active I spend most of my online time on
 Twitter using an accessible Mac client called YoruFukurou. It
 has become another hugely important window to the world for
 me. Twitter leads me to websites I want to read and my blog
 friends link their new posts there. It has become a sort of one-
 stop-shop for the internet, putting all my interests into one
 easy-to-access place. One of my fears is that Twitter will
 change things so that my client will no longer work and then
 Twitter will not be nearly as easy to use as it is now.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: What are the main usability aspects you look for in a
 computer, and on a website?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: I’m spoiled since the only computer I’ve used since
 going blind is a Mac. If it’s not a Mac, I’m not interested. The
 built-in screen reader and the fact that it works so well with
 Mac software has me a loyal customer. When it comes to
 websites, I like a nice headings structure I can use to quickly
 “glance” at the page and get an idea of the layout. Plain text is
 my friend since obviously image-based content is something
 Voiceover can’t read to me. Image descriptions are nice and
 clearly labelled buttons and links are a must.
</p>
<p> 
 Embedded media is a problem, since Voiceover and Flash
 aren’t always friends, so I like direct links. YouTube is great
 since content plays automatically, though I don’t like content
 that plays automatically on a page I’m not expecting. It drowns
 out my screen reader and makes it difficult to navigate. Pages
 that are pretty for the sighted might be completely inaccessible
 to screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: Do you think that more organisations are now making their
 websites accessible to blind and visually impaired computer
 users?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: Yes. I think screen reading technology information is
 becoming more widespread, but technology changes so
 incredibly quickly that one site I visit today might go through
 an overhaul and be completely inaccessible the next. Here in
 the States it is law that government sites be accessible, which is
 great, but those laws haven’t expanded beyond government,
 that I know of.
</p>
<p> 
 Commercial sites such as Amazon are fairly accessible now
 and have been open to suggestions. I use Amazon a lot, and so
 I worry that one day when I visit, something will suddenly
 have changed. Lately, I have found that restaurants pose the
 biggest problem, either using images for their menus or putting
 the menus into a jumbled PDF file. It can be infuriating but it
 seems to me to be rarer and rarer that I am turned away from a
 website due to inaccessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 TP: What benefits can using technology and getting online
 bring to people with disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 ROS: The benefits are endless. For me, the biggest benefit is
 the fellowship. The fact that I never have to be alone is huge. I
 can just jump on Twitter or read blogs or carry on a
 conversation with someone clear across the pond over email.
 For me, information is secondary to the people I get to interact
 with. From blind friends in Canada or Texas or New York or
 Ireland to fellow Tampa Bay Rays baseball fans in Florida, I
 am never alone. The world is at my fingertips, just like it was
 when I could see.
