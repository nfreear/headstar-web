<h3 id="i148-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Launch For New National Disability It Network.</h3>
<p> 
 A new network of 51 specialist organisations across England
 have been funded to help local computer users with a disability
 or learning difficulty to get online and use government
 services.
</p>
<p> 
 The Disability Network initiative has been launched by the
 national technology access body UK Online Centres (
 <a href="http://www.ukonlinecentres.com/">http://www.ukonlinecentres.com/</a>
 ), with specialist learning providers across England receiving funding of &pound;7,500 each to
 provide training and support to disabled computer users.
</p>
<p> 
 Sarah Stabler, network manager at UK Online Centres, told E-
 Access Bulletin that the learning centres will introduce learners
 to basic ICT equipment and online resources, and show them
 what online government services are available which could be
 of use to them. “For example, a disabled person could register
 for a blue disability badge online, find out about benefits and
 support available to them, or use the part of the NHS Choices
 website with information for people with long-term health
 problems”, Stabler said.
</p>
<p> 
 Some learning providers have used the grant, which runs from
 1 April 2012-31 March 2013, to invest in new equipment, such
 as iPad tablet computers, which allows the organisations to take
 the technology out to disabled learners, sometimes in their own
 homes. “The idea is for learners to use the iPad to give them an
 initial hook on the internet, and then progress on from there.
 Individuals may choose to then come into a learning centre and
 take up training on a more formal basis”, said Stabler.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as basic ICT skills such as using a mouse and sending
 emails, some learning centres offer programmes on areas such
 as using Facebook, studying family history, and digital
 photography.
</p>
<p> 
 “Once we’ve got people online, we can find what the personal
 hook might be to keep them online. It could be about
 communication, like using Skype to keep in touch with friends
 and family”, said Stabler. “What we’re hoping is that the
 Disability Network makes the end user a little more
 independent, and opens up access to a range of resources to
 things that might not otherwise have.”
</p>
<p> 
 The learning providers that make up the Disability Network
 include a range of community and training centres and
 grassroots organisations, and are all specialists in their field,
 including several organisations from mental health charity
 Mind, and centres that focus on assisting deaf learners and
 learners with mobility issues.
</p>
<p> 
 As part of their bid to UK Online Centres, each provider was
 required to demonstrate their specialist skills and estimate the
 number of learners they hoped to engage with during the
 funding period, and how many of those would complete an
 online basic skills programme, and how many of these learners
 would progress to using online government services.
</p>
<p> 
 UK Online Centres is in the process of looking for new
 specialist learning providers for the network, as there are still
 funds available. Interested organisations can email

<h3 id="i148-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Price Comparison Sites Excluding Millions, Report Finds.</h3>
<p> 
 Four out of five leading price comparison websites surveyed
 are inaccessible to disabled and elderly users, potentially
 putting them in breach of the Equality Act 2010, a new report
 has found.
</p>
<p> 
 Conducted by ICT access charity AbilityNet, the research
 presents a dismal picture of accessibility by disabled and
 elderly users for the websites, which allow people to compare
 prices of goods and services including online shopping and
 insurance prices.
</p>
<p> 
 A wide range of accessibility issues and barriers were found,
 including images without alternative text, rendering these
 images inaccessible to screen-readers; keyboard traps;
 inconsistent navigation of pages; colour contrasts which may
 be difficult for visually impaired users; and fixed text sizes.
</p>
<p> 
 Fixing these basic issues would be a relatively simple process,
 and “would benefit millions of potential customers”, Robin
 Christopherson, Head of Digital Inclusion at AbilityNet, told E-
 Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Four out of the five comparison websites surveyed
 (comparethemarket.com, gocompare.com
 mysupermarket.co.uk and confused.com) scored just one star
 out of five, and failed to achieve the minimum standard for
 estimated legal compliance, as set out by AbilityNet’s rating
 system – based partially on checkpoints set out in the widely-
 used international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 (WCAG).
</p>
<p> 
 The fifth site, kelkoo.co.uk, scored two stars out of a possible
 five, achieving some of the legal requirements set out in the
 testing.
</p>
<p> 
 The sites were audited by AbilityNet using a mix of manual
 checks, an independent accessibility testing tool (the
 HiSoftware Compliance Sheriff: <a href="http://bit.ly/ITVZqz">http://bit.ly/ITVZqz</a>
 ), and testing by disabled computer users.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, price comparison websites are far from unique
 in their lack of accessibility, Christopherson said: “In our
 estimation, around 90%-95% of websites out there don’t meet
 a base level of accessibility and don’t comply with legal and
 moral requirements. There is also a very significant business
 case to making websites inclusive.”
</p>
<p> 
 The report is the latest in AbilityNet’s bi-monthly ‘State of the
 eNation’ reports, each examining the accessibility of websites
 in a particular sector. It is available as a Word document:

<h3 id="i148-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Campaigners Urge Further Changes To Copyright Law.</h3>
<p> 
 The British Assistive Technology Association (BATA) and
 RNIB are calling for changes to the copyright law to allow
 disabled people to copy all legally owned digital books or
 multimedia into more accessible formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The calls come as part of the organisation’s response to
 consultation on proposed changes to copyright law from the
 UK Intellectual Property Office in a report by Professor Ian
 Hargreaves – chair of digital economy at the Cardiff School of
 Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies – which would allow
 wider and easier access to a range of materials for disabled
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 The independent report, entitled ‘Digital Opportunity: A review
 of Intellectual Property and Growth’ (available here as a PDF:
 <a href="http://bit.ly/e7jPxQ">http://bit.ly/e7jPxQ</a>
 ), proposes changes which would ease restrictions on individuals copying material that they own, such
 as music, films and documents that an individual has
 purchased, allowing copying to more accessible formats for
 personal use. For example, a PDF file could be converted to an
 audio file, or a document could be scanned in order to increase
 the font size.
</p>
<p> 
 However, BATA – which campaigns for the rights of AT users
 – is calling for stronger freedoms allowing individuals to copy
 any material that they have legal access to, and not just material
 that they own. This would include library books and
 information on public websites.
</p>
<p> 
 In its own consultation response, the RNIB said it too supports
 a copyright exception to allow all private copying, and
 “breaking” of digital rights management (DRM) systems that
 prevent this.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall however, the charity – like BATA – welcomed the
 proposed changes. “These changes alone will not end the book
 famine, or problems with access to magazines, news and
 multimedia materials”, the RNIB said. “However, they will
 contribute towards that goal, and with just 7% of published
 works being accessible at present, all reasonable measures that
 can alleviate the book famine should be taken.”

<p>  Clive Lever, Diversity and Equality Officer at Kent County Council, wrote in to bemoan
 the apparent inaccessibility of aspects of an email newsletter
 from an organisation that should be setting the standard:
 “Please can you advise on the best way that we may be able to
 persuade the Equality and Human Rights Commission (of all
 people) to send out newsletters that conform to accessibility
 standards? For instance, three links in a row that say &quot;read
 more&quot; doesn't seem the best example to be setting.”

<p> 
 After receiving the query from E-Access Bulletin, Jean Irvine
 OBE, Equality and Human Rights Commissioner, raised the
 matter internally and writes back to inform us of progress.
</p>
<p> 
 She writes: “I have checked this with the web site manager who
 has asked me to thank you for bringing this to our attention
 [and we are] working to resolve this. We now provide an
 alternative plain text version, as the e-newsletter is sent out as a
 MIME message, in otherwords it contains a message sent in
 both plain text and HTML. Recipients receive one version or

<p>  Phil Smalley, a reader from Leicestershire who is blind, writes in to add to last issue’s
 comments from reader Nigel Timbrell on a move by Panasonic
 to build text-to-speech functionality into 30 of its TV models.
 Nigel had welcomed this move, but said: “My concern would
 be how many people who need this facility are going to go out
 and purchase a brand-new TV set?”
</p>
<p> 
 Phil replies: “While I appreciate Nigel’s comments about
 existing users not having the resources to go out and purchase
 &pound;430+ TV sets in order to benefit from the new technology,
 unfortunately, this is the way of technical advances – wouldn’t
 it be good to have “start-stop” technology fitted to your old
 banger rather than going out and purchasing a new model!
</p>
<p> 
 “No, the exciting thing about the Panasonic development is that
 it’s mainstream. This means those who need to purchase a new
 TV and require text to speech technology can go to the high
 street for a demonstration or purchase the best price online.
 Additionally, more exciting than a mere set-top box, the
 Panasonic range can enable sight-impaired people to record
 and retrieve programmes.
</p>
<p> 
 “Ideally, other manufacturers will follow suit and then when
 you, as a sight-impaired person, want to purchase a TV with
 text to speech, there will be far greater choice in facilities,
 quality and price.”
</p>
<p> 
 Phil concludes: “So thank you, Panasonic, for taking the lead.
 Sadly I won’t be rushing out and purchasing at the moment as
 I’ve just given up on my speech-enabled Freeview box as
 stuttering speech, automatic turning off of audio description
 and freezing/locking up have finally got the better of me, and I
 have switched to Freesat.”
</p>
<p> 
 Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, who is on the committee
 of the Kingston upon Thames Association for the Blind, writes
 in to add his perspective to the debate on talking TVs – and
 talking home appliances in general.
</p>
<p> 
 “About talking domestic appliances: the history of these is not
 a good one. I recall in the late 1970s or early 1980s, Sharp had
 a talking video. Nobody seemed to buy it so they stopped
 making it. Admittedly, the voice was rather robotic. And what
 happened to the talking DAB radio by Pure?
</p>
<p> 
 “I'd like to see the same technology as on the Panasonics used
 on stereo systems and so on. But in a few years’ time, will
 anyone still be making voice-assisted units?”

<p> 
 09: Putting People and Processes First
 By Brian Kelly.
</p>
<p> 
 For many web authors, developers and policy makers, the issue
 of accessibility to disabled people is addressed mainly by
 trying to ensure that their sites conform with the international
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) maintained by
 the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web
 Consortium.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, the UK Government’s ‘Delivering inclusive
 websites guidelines’ ( <a href="http://bit.ly/3lCReg">http://bit.ly/3lCReg</a>
 ), published in 2009, said: “The minimum standard of accessibility for all public
 sector websites is Level Double-A of the W3C Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines. All new websites must conform to
 these guidelines from the point of publication.”
</p>
<p> 
 However, as recently described in a blog post I have written
 (entitled ‘Aversive Disablism, Web Accessibility and the Web
 Developer’: <a href="http://bit.ly/ISdAhh">http://bit.ly/ISdAhh</a>
 ) which details the seventh annual Blogging Against Disablism Day, there is a need to ask:
 “Are web developers and web authors who have embraced
 WCAG guidelines unknowingly creating barriers for people
 with disabilities?” This question could also be asked of
 government policy makers. There is a need for an alternative
 approach which caters for the limitations of policy based solely
 on WCAG conformance.
</p>
<p> 
 The web’s inventor Tim Berners-Lee has said that “The power
 of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless
 of disability is an essential aspect.” However, although this is a
 laudable goal, implementation of WCAG guidelines is not
 necessarily a way of achieving it. For example, WCAG 2.0
 guidelines which state that “content must be understandable”
 would mean that the famous UK newspaper football headline
 from 2003 – “Super Cally Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious” –
 would not be allowed, since this wordplay will only be
 appreciated by those who are familiar with the song from the
 film ‘Mary Poppins’, and the football teams in question. In a
 more general context, while we can understand that people
 with Asperger’s syndrome may have difficulties interpreting
 common phrases such as “it’s raining cats and dogs”, it is
 unlikely that organisations will ban such usage in order to
 ensure that the content is “accessible by everyone regardless of
 disability”.
</p>
<p> 
 A more comprehensive critique of the limitations of the
 WCAG guidelines and the WAI model for addressing web
 accessibility issues is given in my papers on ‘Forcing
 standardization or accommodating diversity? A framework for
 applying the WCAG in the real world’ ( <a href="http://bit.ly/9BHyiH">http://bit.ly/9BHyiH</a>
 ) and ‘Accessibility 2.0: people, policies and processes’ (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/LohYBA">http://bit.ly/LohYBA</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 We can agree that the WAI approach, developed in the late
 1990s, has been valuable in raising awareness of ways in
 which web resources can enhance experiences for people with
 disabilities. But rather than regarding WCAG conformance as
 definitive solution, we should regard it as a useful set of
 guidelines, whose use and relevance needs to be considered in
 light of a variety of factors including the needs of the target
 audience and the resources available for the development of
 the service.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition, there will be the need to consider risks in failing to
 provide a service, even if it does not conform with WCAG
 guidelines. For example, should resources for an ‘amplified
 event’, in which the talks are made available by a live video
 stream and afterwards for downloading, be deleted if resources
 for captioning the videos are not available? Common sense
 would seem to suggest that deleting resources, particularly
 videos of talks which might be particularly valuable to some
 people, is not a great way of enhancing accessibility!
</p>
<p> 
 The BS 8878 Web Accessibility Code of Practise, which is
 summarised by Jonathan Hassell, the BS 8878 editor, on his
 Hassell Inclusion blog ( <a href="http://bit.ly/ugpXgp">http://bit.ly/ugpXgp</a>
 ) provides an agreed mechanism which allows guidelines such as WCAG to
 be used when they are fit for purpose.
</p>
<p> 
 The value of this approach is that it understands the importance
 of the context of usage.
</p>
<p> 
 In the past, criticisms of WAI’s limitations were met by the
 response of “WAI may be flawed, but there is no alternative”.
 We are now in a position whereby there is an alternative
 approach, which has been developed not as a competitor to
 WCAG, but as an overarching framework which enables the
 balanced application of guidelines such as WCAG.
</p>
<p> 
 The development of web services and web applications is a
 process. Accessibility considerations therefore need to be built
 into the everyday practices across the full web development
 life-cycle, from conception and specification through
 development to delivery and maintenance. BS 8878 has been
 developed to document the key stages in the life-cycle.
</p>
<p> 
 Section 6 is the core of the standard. It makes
 recommendations for accessibility being addressed across a 16-
 step model of the web product development and maintenance
 process (described below). These steps span initial conception
 and requirements analysis such as defining the target audiences
 for the web product, and defining the user goals and tasks it
 needs to provide. (steps 1 to 6); strategic choices based on that
 research (steps 7 to 11); the decision to procure or develop the
 web product either in-house or contracted out (step 11);
 production of the web product (steps 12 and 13); evaluation
 (step14); the launch, where it will be important to communicate
 the web product’s accessibility decisions (step 15); and post-
 launch maintenance (step 16).
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, users’ experiences are pre-eminent in assessing the
 accessibility of any web resource. This follows from the
 understanding of accessibility as a property of the relationship
 between the users and the resource, and that context is
 important. In seeking to ensure good experiences for disabled
 people in interacting with web resources, it is essential to
 consider their needs throughout the development cycle, and the
 value of systems that collect and respond to user-provided
 feedback on accessibility, in their own terms.

 Accessify Forum has been the number one destination for
 accessibility
 discussion on the web for nearly six years. Celebrating our
 sixth birthday next month, you’ll find discussion of
 accessibility at all levels, from beginner to guru.
</p>
<p> 
 The site has recently been redesigned and the forum system
 improved. This is still ongoing and you can join in the
 discussions.
</p>
<p>

 want to help others and improve on your own knowledge, or
 just to browse the archives, come and join us at:
