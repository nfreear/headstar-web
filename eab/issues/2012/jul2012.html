<h3 id="i150-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Final Draft Of Mandate 376 Set For Review.</h3>
<p> 
 The latest and final draft of a new European Standard for the
 accessibility of ICT products and services procured by the
 public sector – known as “Mandate 376” – is to be placed
 online next week, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Users, developers, manufacturers, public bodies and procurers
 will have until October to offer feedback on the standard and
 associated documents before formal work begins on legislation
 this autumn.
</p>
<p> 
 The work, co-funded by the European Commission, is being
 carried out by European standards organisations. It aims to
 harmonise accessibility requirements for public procurement of
 ICT across Europe, and to provide a set of tools for the use of
 procurers.
</p>
<p> 
 “Informal feedback on the draft standard is urgently needed
 before it is submitted to the formal – and lengthy – standards-
 making process”, said Dave Sawdon of TRE Projects, who is
 working on the project for the European Telecommunications
 Standards Institute (ETSI).
</p>
<p> 
 Sawdon said the commission hopes the finished standard will
 “promote the procurement of accessible ICT products and
 services by public bodies and hence promote the general
 development and adoption of more accessible ICT.
</p>
<p> 
 “In support of this and to build a coherent EU-US market it is
 hoped to maximise commonality between the emerging EU
 standard and the ongoing refresh of Section 508 of the US
 Rehabilitation Act.” Section 508 is a US law requiring public
 bodies to ensure the ICT systems they buy are accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The new draft will be published at:

<h3 id="i150-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: “Georgie” Apps Make Smartphones Smarter.</h3>
<p> 
 A new series of apps has been developed to enhance
 accessibility features for Android-enabled smartphones for
 blind and visually impaired users.
</p>
<p> 
 The “Georgie” apps allow blind and visually impaired users to
 perform a number of functions additional to ‘standard’ phone
 features, including recording and broadcasting audio blogs;
 photographing text and having it read out to them, using an
 optical character recognition feature; and audio tagging images
 with sound clips. It will also read aloud screen text when users
 touch the screen, and voice recognition software enables users
 to speak the content for text messages into the phone.
</p>
<p> 
 Although all these features are already available from other
 providers, Georgie collects them into one place for the first
 time. It was designed by husband and wife founders of
 assistive technology company Screenreader, Roger and
 Margaret Wilson-Hinds, who are themselves blind, alongside
 software architect Alan Kemp.
</p>
<p> 
 The fact the system was developed by blind users is key to its
 power, Roger Wilson-Hinds told E-Access Bulletin. “We’re not
 second guessing what blind users want. Georgie is not
 retrofitted to software that’s been designed for sighted users.
 Apple and Google both have accessibility settings that are a
 great start, but the intricate and cluttered screens are very
 difficult to navigate around and find the correct button, even if
 it’s being read out.”
</p>
<p> 
 The software is available ready to use and pre-installed on a
 Samsung Galaxy Y smartphone handset for &pound;299, or can be
 downloaded separately onto any existing Android-based phone
 for &pound;149.
</p>
<p> 
 Georgie’s core features help users send text messages; scroll
 through phone book contacts; make phone calls; and configure
 the phone. Three additional bundles of apps (at &pound;24.99 each)
 cover ‘travel’; ‘lifestyle’; and ‘communicate’.
</p>
<p> 
 These additional bundles feature apps that can, for example,
 help users navigate around hazards on a daily route, by
 allowing users to mark known dangers – such as potholes and
 low-hanging branches – on a map, which then reminds the user
 of the obstacle during their journey.
</p>
<p> 
 Georgie is being distributed through Sight and Sound
 Technology: <a href="http://bit.ly/NwA1Lp">http://bit.ly/NwA1Lp</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this year, the One Voice for Accessible ICT Coalition –
 an umbrella group of organisations promoting access to
 technology – published a report on apps that can help disabled
 people, and access to apps and smartphones in general. See:

<h3 id="i150-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Dyslexia Spelling Checker Wins Techology4good Award.</h3>
<p> 
 A piece of software that can correct spelling as the user types
 into any programme – hugely valuable for people with dyslexia
 – has won the accessibility award at the second annual
 Technology4Good awards, presented in London this month.
</p>
<p> 
 “Global AutoCorrect” (
 <a href="http://www.lexable.com/GlobalAutoCorrect">http://www.lexable.com/GlobalAutoCorrect</a>
 ) is the brainchild of Neil Cottrell, a 24-year-old graduate who is
 himself severely dyslexic.
</p>
<p> 
 Other finalists for the accessibility award were Panasonic
 Corporation, for a range of “talking TVs” designed with the
 RNIB (as discussed in recent issues of this newsletter – see:
 <a href="http://bit.ly/HmjoAD">http://bit.ly/HmjoAD</a>
 ); Therapy Box, for a range of of apps supporting people with communication disabilities; and satellite
 TV company BSkyB, for embedding accessibility across its
 products and services, including a talking electronic
 programme guide.
</p>
<p> 
 Also shortlisted for an innovation award was MyChoicePad, a
 Makaton language app for the iPad making Makaton signs and
 symbols much easier and cheaper to use for children and
 adults with special communication needs.
</p>
<p> 
 An AbilityNet Excellence in Accessibility Award went to the
 celebrated physicist Professor Stephen Hawking, who has
 motor neurone disease. Professor Hawking was not able to
 attend the awards ceremony but recorded a message using his
 electronic voice synthesiser, which he operates by twitching his
 cheek.
</p>
<p> 
 He said: “I am delighted to accept this award as recognition for
 all the truly great things that disabled people can achieve when
 technology has given them the chance to shine.
</p>
<p> 
 “I was lucky to be born in the computer age. Without
 computers my life would have been miserable, and my
 scientific career impossible.
</p>
<p> 
 “...the Technology4Good awards remind us that technology is
 a vital part of human existence. They show us that the right
 tools, in the right hands, can help everyone, regardless of our
 frailties, to achieve our true potential and advance as a
 civilisation. And I hope that the Technology4Good awards will
 inspire people to think about the needs of everyone around
 them and make sure they can all benefit from the power of
 computers and the internet to change their lives for the better.”

<p>  Businesses are being asked to pledge their commitment to a minimum standard of accessibility for
 their company website and smartphone apps, by following five
 key design criteria. The 180-Day WebSight Pledge campaign,
 launched by the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB) and PC Pro magazine, will ask companies to adjust
 their site or app over a period of six months to make it easier to
 use for blind and visually impaired users. The five elements of
 the pledge include: avoiding fixed-size fonts; making sites/apps
 screen-reader compatible; using a constant interface; ensuring
 keyboard-alone accessibility; and testing the site/app with blind
 and visually impaired users. RNIB will offer advice and

<h3 id="i150-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: TV Trouble:</h3>
<p>  Following our mention last issue of accessible TV set top boxes manufactured by British firm
 TVonics, our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, who is on the
 committee of the Kingston upon Thames Association for the
 Blind, writes in to say: “Are you aware that TVonics has been
 in administration since 12 June? Though the RNIB say the box
 is still available they won’t be drawn on whether it will
 continue to be produced. I guess we must hope that the
 software is generic enough to run on other makes of box in the
 future with minimal conversion.”
</p>
<p> 
 In response Tara Alexander, Senior Manager – Innovation at
 RNIB who had initially written in about TVonics,
 acknowledged this “unfortunate situation”, and said: “I can
 confirm that we still have stock of the DTR-HD500 set top box
 and are still selling and supporting that box.”
</p>
<p> 
 She also forwarded a holding statement on TVonics going into
 administration from Steve Tyler, Head of Innovation and
 Development at RNIB, which said: “We learned today that
 TVonics has gone into administration. The company has been a
 great support in our bid to bring about a sea change in
 accessibility in the area of TV and related products and
 services.
</p>
<p> 
 “We are unable to comment further until we receive more
 information from TVonics; however the set top box is still
 available via the RNIB shop and our customers are able to call
 our Helpline if they need support.”

<p>  The same reader Brian Gaff has also corrected a claim made in our last issue by the makers of the
 “TechDis Jill”, who thought the voice was the first text-to-
 speech tool to possess a Northern English accent.
</p>
<p> 
 Brian notes that the voice synthesiser software eSpeak, as used
 by the free open source screenreader software NVDA, has had
 a Northern English voice “for ages” alongside its main English
 and American English voices, as well as a West Midlands voice
 and an old-fashioned Received Pronunciation (RP) voice!

<p>  Further to our reporting last issue of a legal settlement between the budget airline bmibaby and RNIB
 over the inaccessibility of the airline’s website, regular reader
 Gustaw Kon writes in to say the settlement was: “Doubtless a
 kind of success but since bmibaby is in some kind of terminal
 state (as it looks), not very useful.
</p>
<p> 
 “Much more useful would be if RNIB ensured that Ryanair
 and Easyjet were more accessible. I used to find Easyjet easy
 to access but they have changed their layout and their website
 is unsatisfactorily accessible. Ryanair are a waste of time.
</p>
<p> 
 “And, while we are about it, what about the big boys... British
 Airways are totally inaccessible. Like practically every airline,
 they use the wonderful idea of presenting a map from which
 you can find and book flights, together with splendid graphical
 representations of timetables. Try hammering them into shape.”

<h3 id="i150-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Opera Blocked:</h3>
<p>  Reader Stephanie Leven has contacted E- Access Bulletin to describe an experience she had recently in
 attempting to receive a digital text copy of English translation
 “supertitles” due to be displayed during a performance of
 Puccini's Italian language opera la bohème she was due to
 attend at Glyndebourne opera house in Sussex.
</p>
<p> 
 As she knew her sight is not good enough to follow these
 surtitles live, Leven contacted Glyndebourne to ask for an
 electronic copy to be emailed her so she could access it in
 advance or convert it into a better format.
</p>
<p> 
 Glyndebourne Productions replied that it was unable to send
 her the supertitle script as it is copyrighted material, but
 suggested an alternative free English language libretto to the
 opera which she could access online.
</p>
<p> 
 Leven says she does appreciate staff were trying to help, but
 feels the copyright law must be changed as soon as possible to
 allow access to this kind of material for disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 She has since written to the Minister for Disabled People, Maria
 Miller MP, to say: “Management should by now be able to
 circumvent the ‘copyright’ excuse, when it is clear of the
 purpose of the request.
</p>
<p> 
 “Although it is now too late for me for Glyndebourne I hope
 we can find a way to move forward so that this does not
 happen to the next visually impaired person. After all, a ticket
 of &pound;215 should include access to the words of the opera in a
 suitable format.”

<p> 
 12: Winning The Accessible Games, Live and Online.
</p>
<p> 
 For Channel 4, being the official broadcaster of the 2012
 Paralympic Games comes with a lot of prestige, but there are
 also significant accessibility challenges. If the website and
 other digital services of this event were not accessible to
 disabled people, it would be absurd – not to mention
 catastrophic from a PR perspective.
</p>
<p> 
 However, rising to these challenges have helped improve the
 overall standard and awareness of digital accessibility within
 the channel, says Paul Edwards, Channel 4’s online programme
 manager for the Paralympics 2012.
</p>
<p> 
 “The fact that we’ve got the Paralympics means that the
 importance of accessibility internally, within the company, has
 been raised. So, people who previously didn’t have much
 knowledge of the challenges of different accessibility needs
 are now learning about it”, Edwards told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Edwards explained to the recent eAccess ’12 conference in
 London ( <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eaccess12/">http://www.headstar.com/eaccess12/</a>
 ) how the Paralympics have provided a driver for a number of Channel
 4’s separate divisions to come together to improve
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Although Channel 4 did already have a corporate accessibility
 programme including role-specific training, and a requirement
 that all its projects be independently reviewed before going live
 to ensure they meet accessibility requirements, one of the
 initial challenges of the Paralympics project was considering
 the different levels of accessibility experience within different
 parts of the organisation, said Edwards.
</p>
<p> 
 “In TV, the whole issue of accessibility is often something
 commissioners and producers don’t have to worry about,” he
 said. “It’s something that’s done once a programme is made,
 and they can then get it subtitled or add audio description.
 That’s obviously not case with the web, where accessibility has
 to be considered from day one.”
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, for Channel 4’s online operations, a significant
 number of external agencies are used for development work,
 which presents a further challenge dealing with varying levels
 of understanding about creating accessible content.
</p>
<p> 
 “In the past, we’ve discovered that there’s a big difference
 between people saying ‘Yes, we understand accessibility’, and
 having their knowledge properly questioned during a selection
 process,” Edwards said. “Now, all prospective suppliers have
 to provide their understanding of accessibility requirements as
 part of the selection process.”
</p>
<p> 
 In broadcasting the Paralympics, Channel 4 will be providing
 more than 400 hours of live sports coverage – more than ever
 before in the channel’s history. As part of this task, Edwards
 and his team have created a number of online platforms
 specifically for Paralympic content.
</p>
<p> 
 Firstly, a Channel 4 Paralympics website has been designed (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/lhBGdx">http://bit.ly/lhBGdx</a>
 ) featuring schedules, results and live video throughout the
 Games. The site is supported by mobile apps on iOS and
 Android systems, all of which have been reviewed by the
 Digital Accessibility Centre, a non-profit accessibility
 consultancy, alongside testing by disabled users.
</p>
<p> 
 A series of short video features have also been created,
 including over 200 video diaries from Paralympic athletes and
 individuals involved with the games, showing their build-up to
 the event and “60-second guides” to Paralympic sports. Both
 of these video series are available with closed captions and
 subtitles.
</p>
<p> 
 Several accessible online game-simulations of Paralympic
 sports have been developed for the site, including boccia, an
 event which sees players in wheelchairs competing to throw
 leather balls as close as possible to a ‘jack’ ball on a court, and
 wheelchair rugby.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, the online video player used to broadcast live sporting
 events has presented a major challenge for text access. “Live
 video for sport is a real challenge when it comes to
 commentary and subtitles, and the accuracy of live captions in
 this area has been derided for some time”, said Edwards. “The
 speed at which live sport moves often means it’s unfeasible to
 produce accurate captions. People have suggested putting a
 delay in the broadcast, but this is often not acceptable to many
 viewers, particularly if there’s an equivalent radio broadcast
 going on at same time.”
</p>
<p> 
 To tackle the problem, Edwards and his team have created an
 online video platform to support text commentary on the right-
 hand side of the screen. “This won’t necessarily be as
 comprehensive as full subtitles, but we’re trying to provide a
 context for what’s happening within the games, while at the
 same time trying to provide a really good viewer experience”,
 said Edwards. “I’ll hold my hands up and say that it’s an
 experiment, but I think it works better than live subtitles for a
 very fast sport like wheelchair rugby. The challenge is to
 balance reporting of every piece of action in a sport with the
 pace of the narrative. We’ve done a lot of tests on that, and
 we’re getting pretty close.”

 Accessify Forum has been the number one destination for
 accessibility
 discussion on the web for nearly six years. Celebrating our
 sixth birthday next month, you’ll find discussion of
 accessibility at all levels, from beginner to guru.
</p>
<p> 
 The site has recently been redesigned and the forum system
 improved. This is still ongoing and you can join in the
 discussions.
</p>
<p> 
 So whether you’re looking to learn more about accessibility,
 want to help others and improve on your own knowledge, or
 just to browse the archives, come and join us at:
