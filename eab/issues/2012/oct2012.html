<h3 id="i152-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: “Finish Line In Sight” For Accessible Copyright Treaty.</h3>
<p> 
 After what will have been five years of negotiations, an
 international treaty to allow the sharing of accessible
 copyrighted material across borders for use by blind and
 visually impaired people could finally be signed in 2013, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 A “roadmap” for formalising a treaty, which would increase
 book access for disabled people including blind and visually
 impaired people, has finally been approved at this month’s
 World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) general
 assembly in Geneva ( <a href="http://bit.ly/OqkKxp">http://bit.ly/OqkKxp</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The roadmap was first presented to a WIPO Copyright
 Committee meeting in July, but general assembly support was
 not a foregone conclusion after earlier interventions by the
 European Union delegation threatened to block progress. Last
 December, EU negotiators attempted to add clauses requiring
 rights-holders to pre-approve all copyright exceptions, a
 condition the World Blind Union (WBU) – a key player in
 WIPO negotiations – had warned would render the whole
 exercise “close to pointless” (see E-Access Bulletin, December
 2011: <a href="http://bit.ly/rWAIrV">http://bit.ly/rWAIrV</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Speaking to E-Access Bulletin about the latest developments
 WBU Vice Chair Dan Pescod said: “[This] points to a clear
 finish line and provides the means to get there, and we’ve
 never had that before. This is fairly significant in terms of the
 seriousness that it demonstrates from pretty much all WIPO
 member states in saying, ‘all right, let’s now get this done.’”
</p>
<p> 
 Crucially, the roadmap identifies a timeline for finalising a
 treaty, with further work set to take place at WIPO’s Standing
 Committee on Copyright and Related Rights session in
 November and an extraordinary meeting of the general
 assembly set for December, as needed to call a diplomatic
 conference in 2013.
</p>
<p> 
 The next step is to create a text that can become an effective
 full treaty, said Pescod. “We don’t want a ‘trophy treaty’ which
 we couldn’t use on the ground. When all of this is said and
 done, the point wasn’t to have lots of negotiations, it was to get
 a law which allows more books to get into the hands of blind
 and other print-disabled people”, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Two issues are now key, Pescod said. “One, that it should be a
 binding treaty; and two, that the content of the treaty we get is
 simple and workable, so that we can actually get people to
 receive more books, otherwise the whole thing is futile. We’ll
 be working really hard with member states to try and make sure
 we get the right provisions in this text, so we can really use it
 meaningfully.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Go On Gold Supporter Diane Mulligan Elected To Uncommittee.
</h3>
<p> 
 Diane Mulligan OBE, one of the UK’s leading national and
 international disability rights campaigners and advisors, has
 been elected to the United Nations Expert Committee on the
 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The committee, of 18 independent experts, monitors
 implementation of the convention by “states parties” –
 countries who have signed up to it. Its work includes assessing
 individual country’s reports on how they have implemented the
 measures of the convention, taking into account what
 improvements have been made and difficulties faced since the
 last report.
</p>
<p> 
 The 2012 committee elections for the term 2013-16 took place
 in New York on 12 September at the fifth conference of states
 parties to the convention. Mulligan was elected with 84 votes
 as one of nine members newly elected or re-elected to the
 body, and will sit as the only UK member.
</p>
<p> 
 In a written statement on Mulligan’s appointment, Maria Miller
 MP, formerly Minister for Disabled People and more recently
 appointed as Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport
 and Minister for Women and Equality, said: “Diane is in every
 respect an outstanding candidate: experienced in advocating
 for disability rights, familiar with the expert committee, and a
 consummate professional who has advised more than 20 states
 on disability and human rights issues.”
</p>
<p> 
 This is not the first time Mulligan has been involved with the
 UN, as she currently co-chairs the organisation’s Task Group
 with the International Disability and Development Consortium,
 and is a member of the Task Force on Accessibility for the UN
 Human Rights Council. She is also a member of the UK
 Equality and Human Rights Commission’s Disability
 Committee, and of Equality 2025, an independent non-
 governmental body which advises the UK government on
 disability issues.
</p>
<p> 
 Mulligan was the subject of a recent video interview for the Go
 ON Gold campaign ( <a href="http://bit.ly/L88fjB">http://bit.ly/L88fjB</a>
 ), a national awareness-raising campaign on access to new technologies by
 disabled people led by E-Access Bulletin publisher Headstar.
 In a previous interview with the bulletin, she spoke about how
 technology has assisted her in both working and personal life:

<h3 id="i152-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Long Legal Battle Ends For Blind Accessibility Advocate.</h3>
<p> 
 The long legal battle between Donna Jodhan, a blind
 accessibility advocate from Canada, over the inaccessibility of
 government websites – as chronicled by E-Access Bulletin over
 several years – is over. With the Canadian government having
 now taken satisfactory remedial action, Jodhan has decided not
 to take any further legal action, declaring her victory “an
 opportunity to create a more accessible environment for all
 Canadians”.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan first noticed that she was unable to use government
 websites due to her impairment in 2006. She sued, with a judge
 initially ruling in her favour, stating that the Government had
 infringed the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and
 giving a time period for the government to make its websites
 accessible to blind and visually impaired users. The
 government appealed this decision in 2011, but in May 2012
 the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal upheld Jodhan’s initial
 victory
 (see E-Access Bulletin issue 138: <a href="http://bit.ly/QHacrm">http://bit.ly/QHacrm</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The appeal court also ruled that the judge who had required the
 government to improve its website accessibility was not in a
 position to oversee this task. This meant it was left to Jodhan to
 determine whether the government had complied with its order
 to improve its websites – a difficult, time-consuming and
 expensive task, requiring auditing of millions of website pages
 – and then decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court of
 Canada if she felt the government had fallen short.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan sought the help of the Canadian National Institute for
 the Blind (CNIB), who agreed to conduct a full accessibility
 audit. CNIB concluded that the Canadian government had
 “done well in remediating and addressing many of the issues”,
 and “has largely met compliance obligations.” After several
 other smaller-scale audits which revealed similar findings,
 Jodhan has now decided not to take any further action.
</p>
<p> 
 Jodhan, who is president of the Alliance for Equality of Blind
 Canadians, told E-Access Bulletin she was “delighted and
 humbled” that the case could finally be closed, but also said
 that this signals the beginning of a further drive towards
 accessibility. “The real work begins now, because we now
 need to monitor the Canadian Government to ensure that they
 do indeed live up to what they have been mandated to do”, she
 said. “As I have said in the past and continue to say, this is not
 just my victory but one for all blind Canadians, and one for
 our kids of the future. It is my cherished hope that the
 Canadian Government would look at this as an opportunity to
 create a more accessible environment for all Canadians.”

<p>  James Semple, a reader from Devon, has posted a comment online to follow up a story originally
 published in our sister newsletter E-Government Bulletin,
 “Accessible Apps More Usable by Everyone”, which reported
 an analyst’s view that mobile apps that are designed to be
 accessible to people with disabilities are more usable by
 everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 “On the issue of accessible app displays, one point not covered
 here - or elsewhere to my knowledge - is the misuse of dark
 blue or purple text,” James writes.
</p>
<p> 
 “Like many old people (I am 72) the lenses of my eyes have
 yellowed, so blue light transmission is reduced. Also, I have
 macular degeneration - the most common visual disability in
 the developed world - and this further reduces the number and
 activity of the blue-sensitive cones in the retina.
</p>
<p> 
 “The end result is that text in dark blue, indigo or violet,
 however bright, is almost the same as black to me. On a dark
 background it is virtually invisible. Even my favourite Twitter
 client, Plume, is sometimes guilty of this.
</p>
<p> 
 “Please can this point be more widely disseminated among
 interface designers.”

<p>  Another reader, writing under the pseudonym “Deaf”, has responded online to an article back in

 Accessible Games, Live and Online&quot;, about the accessibility
 challenges faced by Channel 4 in being the official broadcaster
 of the 2012 Paralympic Games.
</p>
<p> 
 The reader writes: “There’s no excuse not to provide good
 quality real time captioning for online streaming videos. There
 are many qualified stenographers who can type at the
 minimum of 200-220 words per minutes with at least 98%
 accuracy.
</p>
<p> 
 “Unfortunately, Paralympics streaming video on YouTube did
 not offer any captioning at all and left out many millions of
 deaf and hard of hearing around the world. The games were
 not broadcast on TV in all countries.”

Section Three: Profile
Martyn Sibley, Co-Editor, Disability Horizons.

</p>
<p>  Travels Around Technology by Tristan Parker.
</p>
<p> 
 Co-founder and co-editor of the online disability lifestyle
 magazine Disability Horizons, Martyn Sibley has become an
 influential voice in the disability community. A keen
 technology user and advocate, Martyn has run his own social
 media consultancy, is a frequent blogger, and has developed a
 number of e-learning and e- campaigning projects alongside his
 journalism. Here, he talks to E-Access Bulletin about the
 opportunities new technologies have given him over the years.
</p>
<p> 
 E-Access Bulletin: Please give us some background on
 yourself:
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn Sibley: Without getting too hung-up on medical
 conditions, I have spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore,
 since day one I’ve relied on a wheelchair, personal care
 assistants and other adaptations. Despite the physical
 limitations and external barriers such as stairs and stereotypes, I
 went to the local school, played football with friends, gained a
 masters degree and travelled to Australia before starting work
 and have enjoyed six years of various work.
</p>
<p> 
 My first role was at the disability charity Scope. I worked in
 HR administration and gained valuable skills and experience. I
 then completed my dream move to London and began working
 in their fundraising team. After working my way to a strategic
 role it was time for a change. Compounded with bad health in
 winter and a desire to work for myself, I started my own
 business.
</p>
<p> 
 From my blog ( www.martynsibley.com ), I’ve built a vibrant
 online community of people interested in changing the world
 for disabled people. I co-founded the Disability Horizons
 website ( www.disabilityhorizons.com ), run e-learning projects
 (webinars, e-courses and e-conferences on a host of
 independent living tips), speak frequently in the media and
 meet with politicians.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: How have the internet and online tools benefited you
 over the years?
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: First and foremost, online tools helped me personally.
 Google has become my best friend in searching for
 information and contact details for general and disability-
 specific information. More recently, social and new media
 tools underpin my projects on disability issues. Not only does
 this enable the projects, but it also suits my health. Working
 online means I can be in warmer climates during the tougher
 winter time.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: How have you used social media and e-campaigning
 over the years? And how easy is it for people who are new to
 the internet to use these tools?
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: My blog is free on WordPress with a cool design
 “skinned” to it. I used Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to
 connect with people and share my posts. I now have 5,000
 people on my accounts. Disability Horizons used the same
 strategy and receives 20,000 monthly visits.
</p>
<p> 
 I’ve also used webinars to bring together professionals and
 people with direct experience of disability. They log in, as do
 the delegates, deliver their PowerPoint presentation and answer
 questions. I chair the sessions, create the interactive polls and
 also promote them to ensure high attendance.
</p>
<p> 
 More recently, I’ve launched an e-course on employment and
 an e-conference on use of the internet. You can find all of
 these at: www.martynsibley.com/get-involved . I’ve also
 written an e-campaigning guide for the DisLib project. Online
 campaigning is simple and effective. With free tools and the
 right approach, anything is possible.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: Tell us about Disability Horizons, and why you set up
 the website:
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: Having blogged for two years, seen the power of
 sharing positive stories and engaging with cool people, I was
 being asked to guest-post articles. Chatting with my good friend
 Srin on an LA beach for our California road trip, as you do, we
 discussed a platform for others to write about themselves.
 After a basic WordPress theme and a cool name, we launched
 it on a shoestring. Using social media we launched with a bang.
</p>
<p> 
 We were inundated with requests from writers. Covering travel,
 relationships and business, we are the publication for the
 progress of disabled people. We know we have to maintain
 equipment and social care funding and support campaigns to
 do so. However, we are the lifestyle magazine for disabled
 people in the modern world.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: You’ve recently finished your ‘European disability road
 trip’. What was the aim behind the trip, and how did it go?
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: I’ve travelled a lot already to Australia, the US,
 Mexico, Singapore and some of western Europe. I’ve also
 worked a lot on disability issues. So I decided to combine my
 two passions and raise awareness. By taking my adapted car,
 personal care assistant and a lot of courage; we took the boat to
 Amsterdam, Leipzig, Gdansk, Vilnius (my grandfather’s birth
 place), Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, Saarbrucken, Luxembourg
 and Brussels.
</p>
<p> 
 I blogged about transport and access, interviewed disabled
 people and disability organisations to understand attitudes and
 government policy, met media and politicians too. Despite
 great coverage, I am writing a book to share it all properly –
 stay tuned!
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: What kinds of barriers do people with disabilities face in
 accessing and using technology and getting online? What can
 be done to remove these barriers?
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: The main barriers are cost and education. Firstly, if a
 person, their family or school can’t afford specific equipment
 and software, access is denied. Sometimes, simple information
 from government and charitable funding can unlock this
 problem. Scope Response can provide great information on
 this.
</p>
<p> 
 Secondly, disabled people need to be taught how technology
 can enable them. My Dconference [disability e-conference]
 addresses some of this, but larger-scale work is needed with
 disability professionals.
</p>
<p> 
 EAB: And what kinds of benefits can this kind of technology
 access and getting online bring to people with disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn: With the right support, from wheelchairs to personal
 care assistants to technology, disabled people can achieve so
 much. My work began by sharing my very personal learning
 and successes. Whilst no-one should copy another’s goal,
 Disability Horizons instils a belief and a guide to how much
 disabled people can do.
</p>
<p> 
 To access transport, buildings, work, leisure and relationships
 is everyone’s right. Technology is a huge game-changer in
 making this all possible.
