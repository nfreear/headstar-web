<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>STILL TIME FOR EDUCATION BILL.</strong></p>
<p>New government legislation to improve<br />
access to education is set to scrape though before parliament is
dissolved for a General Election.</p>
<p>The Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill had its second
reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday 20 March. It has now
proceeded to committee stage, where final amendments can be
made.</p>
<p>According to Olga Miller, head of the<br />
children's policy unit at RNIB, the committee is likely to push the
legislation through as quickly as possible. Throughout its passage
compromises have been made on both sides to speed its progress,
according to Miller.</p>
<p>The bill is widely criticised by representatives of the disabled
for not requiring schools to buy equipment and not containing
any<br />
reference to accessible information. However, RNIB parliamentary
officer Caroline Ellis says it establishes guidelines for schools
to follow to provide disabled students "access to the curriculum",
which may in some cases mean access to technology.</p>
<p>Such requirements do have "real teeth", Ellis says. Different
modes of redress are open to students or parents who feel adequate
access has not been provided, though its form depends on the age of
the student. A new local-authority run tribunal process is planned
for students under sixteen.</p>
<p>Litigation will be another means of seeking redress, but it will
remain an expensive process. But, according to Ellis, the
Disability Rights Commission would have the power to support some
cases. Ellis said that<br />
compensation awards made under the new legislation are likely to be
practical rather than financial.</p>
<p>As the Bill reached committee this week, the government
announced a separate package of 10 million UK Pounds in new funding
for communication aids for children with special educational needs,
including voice<br />
recognition systems and hand-held spellcheckers.</p>

<p><strong>TELECOMS REPORT LAYS DOWN THE</strong><br />
<strong>LAW.</strong></p>
<p>A report explaining the new rights disabled people have when
they deal with telephone companies has been released by Ricability,
an organisation specialising in providing research for disabled
people.</p>
<p>The new rights will apply from October 2001, having been put
forward in the<br />
Telecommunications (Services for Disabled Persons) Regulations late
last year.</p>
<p>New telecoms access rights include free priority repair
services; the option to nominate someone that can deal with phone
bills for them; and customer information in a form that can be read
by the visually<br />
impaired. The report also touches on issues surrounding access to
digital telecoms devices.</p>
<p>Bob Twitchin, recently appointed chairman of the
Telecommunications for Disabled and Elderly People (DIEL), a
committee set up by parliament to advise the telecoms regulator
Oftel, said: "DIEL commends Ricability for it's work along with the
network operators that helped fund the project with DIEL and
Oftel." For more information about on DIEL see: <a href=
"http://www.acts.org.uk/diel">http://www.acts.org.uk/diel</a></p>
<p>The government is currently considering the nature of a single
regulator for telecoms and media services called Ofcom into which
Oftel will be merged. The RNIB recently made a response to these
proposals: see section three of this issue of E-Access
Bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>NEW ACROBAT LIMBERS UP.</strong></p>
<p>A new version of Acrobat is due for release in April, with much
being made of its enhanced access capabilities.</p>
<p>The most significant addition is the addition of an automated
function that can assess the accessibility of pages it produces.
Other new functions include keyboard shortcuts, high contrast
viewing, zoom capabilities and the generation of a summary of a
document's structure when imported from Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>Of course, the decision to produce an<br />
accessible document will continue to rest entirely with the authors
of PDF files. Authors are under no legal obligation to provide
accessible versions of their file (see section two, this
issue).</p>

which is due for release in April, see: <a href=

<p><strong>RESEARCHERS LOOK INTO TONGUE</strong><br />
<strong>VISION.</strong></p>
<p>Scientists at the University of WisconsinMadison in the US are
working on a device to<br />
allow a person to 'see' using their tongue.</p>
<p>The device works by sending electrical signals from a video
camera to a matrix of minute electrode 'stimulators' lying on the
surface of the tongue. The concept was devised by Professor Paul
Bach-y-Rita who discovered people could feel shapes with their
tongue with a similar resolution as they can with their
fingers.</p>
<p>To learn more about the tongue display device see the home page
of on of the tactile tongue device's developers Kurt Kaczmarek:

<p><strong>GUIDE DOGS WIN TECHNOLOGY</strong><br />
<strong>AWARD.</strong></p>
<p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association's website at <a href=
"http://www.guidedogs.org.uk">http://www.guidedogs.org.uk</a> (see
also e-access bulletin October 2000) has won the 'Charity Website
of the Year' award or organised by publishing companies Popular
Communication and Charity Times. Among the seven nominees for the
award were nonprofit organisations including Action for<br />
Blind People.</p>
<p>Katy Roberts of Guide Dogs for the Blind Association believes
the prize was won thanks to its easy navigation, accessibility and
its unwillingness to compromise on visual appeal.</p>
<p>Treea Cracknell, a web producer at Synergy, the site's designer,
said, "Our brief was it had to be visually exciting and we didn't
realise that not all visually impaired people weren't blind and
preferred graphical sites."</p>
<p>Roberts said that she thinks at least one of the judges was
particularly impressed by its adaptability to the needs of the user
including sighted ones.</p>
<p><strong>GLOVES FOR SIGNING � PART TWO</strong></p>
<p>Following our appeal for information on a glove used for
deafblind signing (E-Access Bulletin, February 2001) Jim Valk,
an<br />
Adjustment Counselor at the Rehabilitation Center for the Blind,
Daytona Beach, Florida writes in with some personal recollections
of the method.</p>
<p>"I recall that in the 1960s I worked with a deaf-blind gentleman
who used that method", Valk says. "I do not know where he learned
it but I vividly remember the glove he used. It was a fairly light
cotton glove, and the letters had been inscribed by hand with a
pen. It appeared that the positions of the letters related to the
knuckled and finger bones and to some extent also the palm of his
hand.</p>
<p>"Walter was not deaf from birth, thus he was able to respond
vocally. I have had virtually no experience communicating
with<br />
congenitally deaf-blind folks, but believe that the glove method,
as I described it, might be less satisfactory unless they had
mastered speech.</p>
<p>"I have no idea if these gloves are sold, but it appears that
plain cotton gloves (white, to allow for visible lettering) are
perfectly practical for adaptation. I believe that accomplished
communicators using this<br />
method would not need to use the glove, and such communication
would afford a really intimate sense of communication.<br />
Communicating experiences and ideas by touch directly with another
human is beyond the range of most people's experience, but it
surely made me feel very close and very loyal to Walter."</p>
<p><strong>BROWSER LAUNCHES THROUGH</strong><br />
<strong>PORTAL.</strong></p>
<p>A free talking Internet browser for visually impaired people has
been launched by<br />
WeMedia, a US company that runs a portal for disabled people.</p>
<p>Though recognising that it is an admirable first effort, people
who have tried it complain it is too verbose and the speech is too
slow for someone who needs to use voice synthesis regularly. Among
its more irritating foibles is to say, "I will now read the title
for you," before reading a title.</p>

<p><strong>BLIND COPYING.</strong><br />
By David Mann <a href=
"mailto:david.mann@rnib.org.uk">david.mann@rnib.org.uk</a></p>
<p>In March, the UK government's Patent<br />
Office, part of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), finally
published its longawaited consultation paper called
'Exception<br />
to copyright for the benefit of visually impaired people'.</p>
<p>The document explores options for changes in the law affecting
the production of alternative formats such as digital files for
copyright works in all situations - at home, in the workplace, in
school or library. It covers activities by individuals and
small<br />
organisations as well as by larger agencies.</p>
<p>Currently, under the Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988 blind
and visually impaired people are in a doubtful legal position when
downloading information from the Internet and turning it into
braille and other alternative format media, even when the
information is in the public domain and even when it is provided by
public bodies and utilities. The very act of digital capture of the
material, even for the sole purpose of making it accessible, could
be deemed illegal unless the rights holders specifically allows
it.</p>
<p>The government appears to be proposing a two-pronged solution
under which nobody would need to seek permission for the<br />
creation of single accessible format versions for identifiable
individuals. Where a multiple copy licence is not available, the
consultation paper recommends that people should not be prevented
from making multiple copies.</p>
<p>The initial response of the RNIB is to decry any reliance on
licences. It feels that not only is it inappropriate to license
what should be a basic right, but the fact that a licence might be
available does not mean it would be on satisfactory terms.</p>
<p>As E-Access Bulletin went to press, the Publishers' Licensing
Society<br />
(<a href="http://www.pls.org.uk">http://www.pls.org.uk</a>) and a
number of other groups moved to partially pre-empt any ultimate
legislation on copyright access by releasing the 'VIP guidelines',
which waive their right to be asked for permission when single
accessible format versions of<br />
copyrighted material are being produced for identifiable
individuals.</p>
<p>This is an extremely positive development, and will be of
particular benefit to small voluntary groups and libraries, even
though it has as yet no statutory backing and individual rights
owners retain the right to opt out.</p>
<p>The digital access charity HumanITy<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.humanity.org.uk">http://www.humanity.org.uk</a>) has
welcomed the government consultation process as "eminently superior
to reliance on agreements with individual authors and
publishers".</p>
<p>However, HumanITy's director Kevin Carey said it was "a matter
of deep regret that such access has not been included in the
European Union Copyright Directive still under<br />
discussion". And he added: "As they<br />
currently stand, discussions between<br />
alternative format producers and the licensing regime have produced
a proposed protocol more onerous than that which currently operates
and so the consultation paper is unduly optimistic".</p>
<p>Carey says that much confusion has arisen between the
fundamental right to access information and the occasional
discretionary privilege of accessing it for free.</p>
<p>The essence of the latter point is that, where sighted people
must pay to access<br />
information, there is no reason why visually impaired people should
not pay as well, although they should perhaps pay less, since some
of a work's value (for example book illustrations) is lost in
translation to other formats.</p>
<p>To avoid endless discussions over every copyright work, Carey
says the government should establish guidelines on the price to be
paid for access via alternative formats. Authors could waive this
if they wished.</p>
<p>Carey says fears among copyright holders that alternative format
production will lead to an increase in pirating of material are not
backed up by evidence. "On this basis, technical blocks [to
alternative format files] are a tedious, injurious and insulting
irrelevance," he says.</p>
<p>Developments in the UK are set against an equally confused
international background.</p>
<p>In December 2000, a delegation representing the World Blind
Union approached the World Intellectual Property Organisation to
ask it to encourage the introduction of provisions for blind and
partially sighted people into the copyright legislation of all
countries. The representatives also explained that an accumulation
of national provisions was in itself inadequate, and an
international arrangement needed to be reached if the electronic
age was to bring its full potential to all.</p>
<p>On the first of these points, some progress was made, with WIPO
pledging to examine ways of encouraging countries, particularly
developing countries, to introduce appropriate measures into their
national legislation.</p>
<p>Less comfort was offered on the international front. WIPO
treaties do not enshrine access rights, and any change to this
approach would have to be agreed unanimously by all<br />
signatories. This would clearly be an<br />
extremely tall order, and the delegation's leaders concluded that
the best way forward would be to prepare proposals for new<br />
international 'understandings' for WIPO to consider backing as a
starting-point.</p>
<p>The delegation also drew attention to the importance of
audio-description of films and television programmes for blind and
visually impaired people, and of ensuring that<br />
provisions on moral rights did not allow performers to object to
this practice per se, while retaining the right to object to low
standard audio-description if it distorted their performance.</p>
<p>WIPO is currently negotiating a treaty on audio-visual rights,
which includes an 'agreed statement' on what could constitute
distortion of a performer's work. The organisation claims this
means artists cannot object to an audio-described version of their
work. However, the World Blind Union regards it as a fudged outcome
which will disappoint those fighting for the rights of blind and
visually impaired people in a rapidlychanging<br />
technological environment.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: ADVENTURE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>POLAR EXPLORATION.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JOURNEY TO THE EDGE OF THE WEB.</strong><br />
By Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Zimbabwe-born Miles Hilton-Barber's recent bid to be the first
blind man to reach the South Pole showed how the Internet could be
used to involve people in one man's<br />
adventure. But his journey also showed how old-fashioned
technologies, ranging from two-way radio to cosmetic mirrors, were
still very much needed to push the boundary of the Internet to ends
of the earth.</p>
<p>Challenging Horizons<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.rnib.org.uk/horizons/">http://www.rnib.org.uk/horizons/</a>),
a section of the RNIB site dedicated to derring-do, provided news
and background information and a place to email the expedition
team. During the expedition itself around 5,000 people a month
tracked Hilton-Barber's southerly progress online.</p>
<p>The usage levels were given a helping hand by strong traditional
media interest in the expedition, which the site's organisers tried
to foster. Among the eclectic range of<br />
organisations to cover the story were The Sun, The Mirror, The
Guardian, Channel Five and Christian World, together with a host of
web sites dedicated to exploration. According to the expedition's
PR manager the media campaign was helped by the ability to send
weekly interview questions to Hilton-Barber.</p>
<p>The site also offered the chance to donate cash to the
expedition online, a feature an unusually high proportion of
visitors people used. Most sites find it extremely difficult to
instil enough confidence to enter credit card details online.
Puttick believes visitors to the RNIB site were particularly
willing to give because of the relatively high level of trust
instilled by the RNIB and the extreme nature of Hilton-Barber's
challenge.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising, given the slick Internet publicity,
was that the technology used by the explorers themselves was<br />
relatively crude. Hilton-Barber said that the most useful piece of
guidance equipment were the ends of his ski-tips, which he could
use to sense the nature of the terrain immediately ahead of him. He
also has stories of an aircraft landing system relying on local
women marking the edge of a blue-ice<br />
runway with cosmetic mirrors while a man on a skidoo shouted wind
speeds to a radio operator in a tent.</p>
<p>The team had originally hoped to be able to communicate directly
with home base using a satellite link-up, but unfortunately the
Inmarsat satellite service they planned to use was not in service.
So unlike sailors, like Hilton-Barber's brother who recently became
the first blind man to sail solo from the US to Australia or
round-the-world yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur, the team was unable to
stream live video footage of the trip.</p>
<p>Also, without a direct satellite linkup, emails submitted to the
web site could not be sent to the Antarctic team directly. Instead
they had to be forwarded to the expedition's coastal base in
Patriot Hills where they were relayed over short wave radio. The
radios were also used to send back temperature and mileage updates
for navigation purposes and for inclusion on the site.</p>
<p>Hilton-Barber said they had also looked at various pieces of
hardware to make<br />
communication between team members<br />
easier, among them an avalanche detector and a miniaturised
microphone and earpiece system. In the end, though, they all turned
out to be "too finicky", so the team turned back to large
old-fashioned two-way radios.</p>
<p>In the end Hilton-Barber was forced to abandon his attempt on
the pole before he made it because he succumbed to frost bite of
the fingers. But this has not stopped people sending hundreds of
emails of congratulations through the web site, Puttick says.</p>
<p>Ultimately the plan is to replace the polar expedition
information featured on the Challenging Horizon's portion of the
RNIB web site with other exploits of this nature. Hilton-Barber
looks set to take centre stage once again, with plans to take part
in the 200 kilometre Silk Run in China, a marathon following the
course of the Silk Road. That is unless someone can come up with
any more daring ideas.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: MEDIA REGULATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CONVERGENCE.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMMUNICATIONS WHITE PAPER.</strong><br />
By Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>The UK government's recent communications white paper "fails to
deliver adequate consideration to the needs and interests of blind
and partially sighted people, and of older and disabled people in
general," according to an official response published by the
RNIB.</p>
<p>Though it supports the general idea of a single regulatory body,
the RNIB concludes that the regulator proposed in the bill, Ofcom,
would not have the clout to make sure the necessary level of access
is available. The institute criticises the bill's failure to employ
primary legislation and licence conditions to ensure access
compliance, saying this<br />
weakness would mean universal access to post-switchover public
service broadcasting and the Internet will not be met.</p>
<p>Disappointment was also expressed that the bill did not contain
the means to enforce Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) standards
even on the government's own web sites. The RNIB recommends
government sites be<br />
required to meet at least level one of WAI web content
accessibility, the lowest grade handed out by WAI. It also says
the<br />
government should legislate to ensure all communications companies
with web<br />
presences to do the same.</p>
<p>Another criticism levelled at the bill is that it has a limited
view of access difficulties. Section 5.2.1 of the bill says
"everyone now has access to radio and television<br />
programmes," a statement the RNIB believes is untrue. To help
improve the situation it is recommending that a future bill
requires digital television providers to dedicate a channel to
audio descriptions.</p>
<p>The RNIB also takes exception to the bill's propagation of "the
myth that the cheapness of ICT technology equates currently to full
accessibility and usability". It points out that the
inaccessibility of mobile phones and settop boxes means those they
exclude miss out on subsidised access. The RNIB suggests Ofcom
helps visually impaired and blind people make better choices of
technology by encouraging ISPs and digital television providers to
promote their services<br />
specifically to these people.</p>
<p>According to the RNIB it is economically or legally tenable to
exclude people from voting on-line or receiving medical advice or
vital health information through an interactive digital television.
It would ultimately be cheaper to provide these services online. It
would also be unfair, says the RNIB, if sighted people registering
tax returns or civic licences on-line receive financial rewards
denied to other who cannot access these online facilities.</p>
<p>The proposed powers for Ofcom over<br />
electronic programme guides, which help people navigate digital
television services with hundreds of channels, was said to ignore
problems they cause for visually impaired people. Ofcom must
enforce clear guidelines on how such information is presented for
visually impaired people. The white paper also ignores the fact
that radio receivers will become more complex and more inaccessible
to visually impaired people too. The RNIB called on Ofcom to ensure
they were<br />
accessible to the visually impaired.</p>
