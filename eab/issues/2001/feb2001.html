<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUSH USES E-ACCESS AS OLIVE BRANCH.</strong></p>
<p>Newly inaugurated US President George W Bush has said he will
increase the Federal support given to research into technology for
the disabled and provide financial help to disabled people to gain
access to assistive technologies and the Internet.</p>
<p>The rate of computer and Internet usage among US citizens with
disabilities is half that of people without disabilities.</p>
<p>Bush hopes to reinvigorate research into assistive technologies
by injecting funds into the Interagency Committee on Disibilities
Research, which will coordinate Federal research efforts and
encourage collaboration with the private sector.</p>
<p>The Federal administration proposes to guarantee any
low-interest loans given by state administrations to disabled
people to equip themselves for telework. Bush also proposed relief
from corporation tax for cash spent on equipping disabled employees
to work at home.</p>
<p>The proposals were part of the 'Freedom Initiative', a one
billion US dollar spending programme that also attempts to remedy
problems faced by disabled people in education, work, homeownership
and transportation. While 71% of people without disabilities own
homes, less than 10% of people with disabilities do.</p>
<p>Political correspondents in Washington interpreted the
initiative as way for Bush to build bridges with members of the
Democratic Party. Senator Edward Kennedy, a Democratic elder
statesman, was present at the White House presentation. More

<p><strong>UK GOVERNMENT BEEFS UP</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES.</strong></p>
<p>A draft of 'version 2.0' of the guidelines for UK government web
sites contains an e-access chapter some five times longer than the
one in the previous, first version issued last year.</p>
<p>The new guidelines, currently issued for consultation among
government webmasters and due to be posted on the web in early
March, strengthens recommendations to improve web site access to
people with a wide range of disabilities including visual
impairment, hearing impairment, motor disability, 'technophobia',
'economic disability', cognitive disability, and 'selective
disturbances' such as epilepsy.</p>
<p>They include a 23-point accessibility checklist for government
agencies, drawing heavily on recommendations published by the Web
Access Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (see
following news story, 'New W3C standards released').</p>
<p>Though there is currently no legal requirement for government
departments to comply with the guidelines, the draft states that
all web pages "must comply with the WAI 'A' standard", the lowest
of three WAI access grades. The draft also sanctions the use of WAI
logos to advertise its level of accessibility and recommends the
use of the accessibility checker software Bobby (<a href=
"http://www.cast.org/bobby">http://www.cast.org/bobby</a>)</p>
<p>The Version 1.0 guidelines are at:<br />
<a href="http://www.eenvoy">http://www.eenvoy</a>.<br />
gov.uk/egovernment/iagc/guidelines/webs ites/websites.htm</p>
<p><strong>NEW W3C STANDARDS RELEASED.</strong></p>
<p>The second version of the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines � the widely-used international
standards for ensuring web sites are accessible to people with
disabilities including visually impaired people � have been
published.</p>
<p>A working draft of version 2.0 of the guidelines was unveiled on
25 January. Once completed, they aim to broaden accessibility
standards beyond the basic language of the web, HTML, to scripting
languages like Java and other technologies like WAP for mobile
devices.</p>
<p>For a point-by-point comparison between version 1.0 and the new
working draft, see <a href=

<p><strong>WORKING TOWARDS ACCESSIBLE JOB</strong><br />
<strong>SITES.</strong></p>
<p>An online resource to help visually impaired people to gain and
retain jobs is to be launched shortly as part of 'Out of Sight �
Out of Work', a campaign instigated by Opsis, an association of
eight charities providing education, training and support to the
visually impaired.</p>
<p>The site, which is due to launch at the end of spring 2001, will
include information relevant to blind employees and employers, case
studies and links to participating organisations. Action for Blind
People, RNIB, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Royal Federation for the
Blind and Blind in Business are involved in the web project, in
addition to Opsis members.</p>
<p>The eight regular members of Opsis are: Action for Blind People,
Catholic Blind Institute, Henshaws Society for Blind People, Queen
Alexandra College, Royal London Society for Blind, Royal National
College, Royal School for the Blind (Liverpool) and West of England
School and College. For further information about Opsis call Chris
Gregory on 0121 428 5037.</p>
<p>The government, meanwhile, is inviting comments about the
accessibility of its nascent one-stop government jobs web site,
'Worktrain'. The site provides an online equivalent of a job centre
with information about benefits, training programmes, career
guidance and national job vacancy notice boards.</p>

Department for Education and Employment, can be viewed at<br />

<p><strong>GLOVE FOR DEAFBLIND SIGNING.</strong></p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin reader Ed Meskys has submitted an open query
following our January article on communications methods and<br />
technologies used by deafblind people. He says: "About 20 years ago
I read the book<br />
'Independent living without sight and hearing' by the late
president of the Hadley School for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.hadley-school.org">http://www.hadley-school.org</a>),
Dr Richard Kinney (the book was published by Gray Dove, Illinois,
1972).</p>
<p>"Kinney mentioned one other communication technique not
mentioned in your article, a glove with letters of the alphabet
printed in specific places, which are memorised by the user. The
user can then communicate with people<br />
unfamiliar to him or her, such as a flight attendant on an
aeroplane, using tactile signing. The deafblind person can point to
letters to give a message to the other person, and the other person
can touch the letters which the deafblind person will feel.</p>
<p>"Is this glove still made and used?" Answers to the editor
please � Dan Jellinek on<br />
<a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> - we will
forward anything received to Ed and print it in a future issue.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIBE-ONLINE ENGINEERING WORKS</strong><br />
<strong>ON TRACK.</strong></p>
<p>Describe-online, the planned online database of
audio-descriptions of railway stations and other public spaces, is
inviting individuals or organisations to submit their own
descriptions of national rail stations anywhere outside the M25
London motorway area.</p>
<p>Since its launch last year (see E-Access Bulletin, June 2000)
the experimental service has expanded its initial database of
London Underground stations and an audio version of the National
Rail Map.</p>
<p>The service includes descriptions of platforms and concourses;
which train lines a station is on; and the location of facilities
such as telephone booths. It is at:<br />

<p><strong>MYIVAN � CORRECTION.</strong></p>
<p>In our January issue we mentioned a voiceactivated web navigator
agent called 'IVAN',<br />
and said it was free to download from<br />
<a href="http://www.myivan.com">http://www.myivan.com</a></p>
<p>A Bulletin reader, Barry Harvey, has since pointed out it is
only the upgrade that is free: all that appears to be on offer for
the first-time user is a 'starter kit' containing headset,
microphone and software CD for 49.95 US Dollars.</p>
<p>We apologise for suggesting the service was free, although some
confusion seems to remain, since in one place the IVAN web site
talks about downloading the software, not buying it on CD, and it
also has specifications for headsets it will work with, which seems
puzzling if you have to buy their headset anyway. We have emailed
the manufacturer for further clarification and will keep you
posted.</p>
<p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF:</strong></p>
<p>IRISH DISCUSSION: A new un-moderated<br />
discussion group is being formed for people interested in sharing
news, information and opinion on Irish IT access issues. According
to Frontend.com, the Dublin-based computer interface design company
that is initiating the project, the discussion may ultimately
become a formal special interest group allowing the Irish
government, industry and lobbyists to interact:

<p>TECHNOLOGY IN SCHOOLS: The<br />
Technology in Learning and Education (TiLE) programme is looking
into the impact of technology on the education of young people with
visual impairment. TiLE's research into the impact of the
technology used by 10 local authorities will be presented in
case-study form. Previous TiLE reports are at:<br />

<p>BEACON ISSUES: The Department of the<br />
Environment, Transport and the Regions has announced the 11 new
'beacon' themes by which local authorities can apply to have their
services judged. Among this year's themes were the improvement of
access to council amenities through improved mobility and the<br />
transformation of libraries into community resources that can be
both in person or electronically. See: <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: TECHNOLOGY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AUDIOBOOKS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TAPES DOMINATE DESPITE SNAGS.</strong></p>
<p>When E-Access Bulletin subscriber Carl Wooten from the US
complained he was fed up with the unreliability of audiobooks on
magnetic cassette tape and said he couldn't understand why there
weren't more available in CD or other digital formats, we thought
we'd investigate.</p>
<p>With 'MP3' and other downloadable digital audio formats
constantly in the news, you'd think that by now you could simply
switch on the computer, pay a small fee and download the latest
novels to a miniature audio player. Unfortunately, this is not yet
the case.</p>
<p>Certainly in the US there are various<br />
subscription-based 'audiobook clubs', which will supply by mail
order a set number of audiobooks on CD, depending on the level of
your monthly subscription. RecordedBooks<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.recordedbooks.com">http://www.recordedbooks.com</a>)
and<br />
Audiobookclub<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.audiobookclub.com">http://www.audiobookclub.com</a>)
are just two US companies that offer books on CD for rental or
purchase. But many visually impaired people may have limited
finances and find it undesirable to pay for an audiobook they might
listen to only once. The real problem is that few lending
libraries, particularly those for the blind, don't stock audiobooks
on CD.</p>
<p>Helen Brazier, deputy chief executive of the National Library
for the Blind UK, explains: "For various historical reasons, we
don't hold audiobooks at all at present. But we might consider
distributing new formats of audiobooks in future if a convergence
of technologies and agencies is realisable."</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is that just about everyone has access
to a tape player, so the traditional audio cassette continues to be
the favoured format for audiobooks. The most recent figures
available for the US show that it's a major growth area, with 60
million books on tape sold in a year.</p>
<p>But there are many problems with audio tapes, as our reader Carl
Wooten relates: "I have a cassette reader which is heavy and bulky.
CDs would be a lot easier to play and carry, when you travel as
much as I do. One of my main problems with books on tape is some
are broken or have been stretched, or you might get a missing tape,
and the person who uses them before you often doesn't tell the
library. Also tape machines often break down: I have worn out three
so far."</p>
<p>John Palmer, from Calibre<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.calibre.org.uk">http://www.calibre.org.uk</a>), a
library that offers 5,000 titles free on cassette to visually
impaired people, says, "The main impediment to getting audiobooks
into other formats, such as digital, is that publishers are nervous
about copyright issues. There's no doubt that our type of service
will become a virtual one eventually, but until there is
copyright-protected software for digital versions and cheaper
access to improved bandwidth technology, we're sticking with
cassettes. They have stood the test of time so far and in 30 years
have not yet been completely superseded by anything else.</p>
<p>"The next step in technological developments will probably
leapfrog 'moving parts'<br />
technology (ie cassettes and CDs) once we have achieved faster
download times and improved solid-state storage technology. Most of
our members are elderly � average age 78 � so the technology needs
to be user-friendly and financially accessible. If this PC-based
and portable audio technology doesn't improve, the next step may
even be to receive audiobooks via digital TV."</p>
<p>Some books are available on CD, but even this format has its
limitations. A CD can hold only 74 minutes of audio, compared with
a standard 90- minute cassette, and most CD players cannot
'remember' where the recording was last stopped. The possibilities
of DVDs are greater, but there are still only a small number of DVD
players and recorders in circulation.</p>
<p>At the moment, says Kevin Carey, director of HumanITy and
vice-chairman of the RNIB, music CD format is best for abridged
books. "It's simple and it's tracklisted. But there is a lot of
work being done on the DAISY (digital audio information system)
standard<br />
(<a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>), which
can be indexed and listened to via a player or PC software."</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Netread<br />
(<a href="http://www.netread.com">http://www.netread.com</a>), a
company that aims to exploit the latest web-based software to
address problems in publishing, says: "Just as the new downloadable
digital formats, such as MP3, are shaking up the music industry, it
is almost certain that audio publishing will see a shift in format
in the near future. Digital reproduction of spoken audio requires
less dynamic range and fidelity than a musical recording. Put in
the right format, a spoken audio file potentially could be much
smaller than a music file. This would translate into faster
download times and a higher storage capacity for portable
players."</p>
<p>"The advantage of downloadable audio files is the elimination of
manufacturing costs and retail prices reflect the savings � a
recent novel by Stephen King would cost 40 US Dollars on tape and
18 Dollars in a digital format." Also, the production time is
crucial. There can be a six to eight-month lead-time to manufacture
and distribute a cassette version of a best selling book, whereas a
company such as Audible.com can record and release an audio book in
a matter of days.</p>
<p>Digital audio files can be played back on a PC, using free
downloadable software, or on a portable device. And just as few
people would choose to read a book on their computer, few audiobook
listeners would like to be tied to their PC. So the future of
digital audiobooks must lie in portable devices and there are a
number these on the market, such as the Diamond Rio.</p>
<p>US-based Audible.com<br />
(<a href="http://www.audible.com">http://www.audible.com</a>)
currently leads the way in producing a downloadable format
optimised for speech. MediaBay.com also allows subscribers to
download books in digital format or to audiostream them to a PC,
offering "20 hours of listening for 9.95 Dollars per month".</p>
<p>It seems that as with all innovative technology, for now we will
have to second-guess which formats � and hardware � will end up as
the standard. And certainly in the UK, with the high cost of
Internet access as it currently stands, downloading hours of
audiobooks is still prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: CONFERENCE PREVIEW.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CSUN.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SURFING IN CSUN.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the star items among the hundreds of presentations due
to take place at the giant annual California State University
Centre on Disabilities' 'Technology and persons with disabilities'
conference in Los Angeles are new ideas to help visually impaired
people get more from the Internet.</p>
<p>The conference, known as 'CSUN', will be held in Los Angeles
between 19 and 24 March 2001. See: <a href=
"http://www.csun.edu/cod/">http://www.csun.edu/cod/</a></p>
<p>A method of using the Internet to deliver real time information
to disabled people will be outlined by the Trace Research and
Development Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (<a href=
"http://www.trace.wisc.edu/">http://www.trace.wisc.edu/</a>).
According to researchers, the system could be used to deliver
descriptions-on-demand. In one possible set up, verbal descriptions
of images sent from a wireless Internet device linked to a camera
in the end of a blind person's cane would be sent to an
earpiece.</p>
<p>SSB Technologies<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/">http://www.ssbtechnologies.com/</a>)
will unveil a suite of programs designed to cut the cost of making
existing web sites accessible. SSB claims its accessibility
checking tool, 'InSight', can reduce the time spent spotting
accessibility problems by 90 per cent and 'InFocus', which suggests
solutions to access problems, can cut the time spent correcting
them by 75 per cent.</p>
<p>Some of the first commercially produced 'Tiger' tactile graphics
embossers from ViewPlus Technologies (<a href=
"http://www.viewplustech.com">http://www.viewplustech.com</a>) will
be on show. The embossers are able to render computer images in a
way that can be felt at a resolution of 20 dots per square inch,
which is sufficient to reproduce of charts and tables. ViewPlus
shipped the first batch of hand-built Tigers in March 2000, before
commercial production began in December 2000. The University of
Hertfordshire's National Centre for Tactile Diagrams (<a href=
"http://www.nctd.org.uk">http://www.nctd.org.uk</a>) has had Tiger
on loan since July 2000.</p>
<p>The Tiger embosser was developed by Oregon State University
Science Access Project (<a href=
"http://dots.physics.orst.edu/">http://dots.physics.orst.edu/</a>)
before being put into commercial production by ViewPlus
Technologies. The Oregon researchers will present two applications
which can operated using Tiger and a touch sensitive graphics pad,
or using tactile devices like a haptic mouse. Haptic mice can guide
a users hand and relay different sensations depending on their
location within a graphic image.</p>
<p>In another development from the same team, a new application can
identify the fundamental geometric elements of images even when
they are not originally labelled by the creator. The prototype
program can be instructed to give voice or Braille descriptions of
each element as a user 'browses' the image. Alternatively, a user
can instruct the program to guide them to a particular element of
the image. The software package can provide tactile images at
different levels of magnification, a particularly useful facility
when using a haptic mouse.</p>
<p>The Oregon research team does not expect its smart-graphics
package to move out of the lab for over a year, but an accessible
graphing calculator is expected to be available within weeks. The
calculator program will cost 75 Dollars and will be available for a
30-day free trial from the ViewPlus Technologies web site.</p>
<p>Finally, a team from the Assistive Technology Centre of the
University of Sussex hopes to show programmers how to get
accessibility right first time by presenting a paper on the<br />
implementation of the National Internet Accessibility Database
(NIAD).</p>
<p>The online database (<a href=
"http://niad.disinhe.ac.uk">http://niad.disinhe.ac.uk</a>) aims to
provide a product guide to technology which can help people study.
It covers six product categories: audio equipment; ergonomic
equipment; hardware products; miscellaneous equipment; software
products and visual equipment.</p>
<p>NIAD is funded by the Disability and<br />
Information Systems in Higher Education (DISinHE), an access
project funded by the UK Higher Education Funding Councils (see
EAccess Bulletin, March 2000).</p>
<p>[Section three ends.]</p>
<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: BUSINESS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BLIND BUSINESS ASSOCIATION.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REVITALISED BBA MEANS BUSINESS.</strong></p>
<p>After a two-year 'fallow period' and a membership crisis the
Blind Business<br />
Association (BBA), which supports visually impaired people who are
self-employed, is being relaunched under "new and energetic"<br />
management. The BBA assists its members through networking,
business mentoring, conferences, seminars and other events.</p>
<p>New president Brendan Magill, a self-employed business and
information technology consultant and researcher, says: "Changes in
the workplace are making it increasingly difficult for visually
impaired people to compete with sighted colleagues, so
self-employment will play an increasingly important role for these
people."</p>
<p>Though visually impaired himself, Magill only became involved
with blind organisations in 1996 after becoming a part time
lecturer at the Royal National College for the Blind following an
attempt to acquire some college<br />
administration business. Magill became a consultant in 1991 after
selling the six-person business he built after leaving a job as a
computer programmer at a local authority in 1986.</p>
<p>Since the BBA's 1998 conference there has been a period of
relative inactivity, which led to a dramatic fall in membership.
"The members of the organisation are both self-employed and
visually impaired, which is not always a mixture that lends itself
easily to smooth operation," says Magill. "This was compounded by
the fact that the officers and directors of the BBA give their time
voluntarily, while having to run their businesses."</p>
<p>However, the process of rebuilding the membership, which at its
peak was 130, is already underway. The BBA is undertaking a
campaign of advertising on the Internet and in specialist
publications and is promoting itself through the national network
of people working in the visual impairment field. Work has also
begun on developing a BBA website.</p>
<p>"In particular," says Magill, "we want to encourage young people
who are visually impaired and wish to start new businesses. To do
this, the BBA is promoting itself via specialist further education
colleges. But we also want to encourage and support older members
and people who may have become visually impaired at any point in
their lives."</p>
<p>Working through its separate charitable arm, the Blind Business
Association Charitable Trust, the BBA also offers start-up grants
to people setting up new businesses. But Magill is cautious about
the immediate benefits of new technology. "Information and
communications technology is overrated as a solution to the
problems faced by visually impaired people. Indeed, it often poses
barriers. Consider websites that use different colours, fonts,
character weights and graphics � most of these attributes are
meaningless to most visually impaired people. Email, however, is
important because it is universally accessible.</p>
<p>"The two major areas of ICT that could help our membership would
be improved accounts and business contact information software,
most of which is totally inaccessible to visually impaired people.
We would hope to promote the<br />
development of improved software or<br />
adaptations in this area," said Magill.</p>
<p>The BBA is hoping to organise a conference in late summer, which
it will market via its newsletter, internet mailing lists and
specialist publications. For further information email: <a href=
