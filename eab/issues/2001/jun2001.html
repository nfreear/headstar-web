<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>'CHAOS' AS US GOVERNMENT</strong><br />
<strong>SCRAMBLES FOR ACCESSIBILITY.</strong></p>
<p>Late action and a lack of awareness of technology access issues
across many US government agencies is resulting in "chaos" as they
scramble to hit Monday's deadline for tighter federal software and
hardware standards, according to one leading US expert.</p>
<p>New 'Federal Acquisition Regulations' made under Section 508 of
the US Rehabilitation Act 1973 stipulate that all development,
procurement, maintenance and general use of electronic and
information technology has to be accessible to those with
disabilities (see E-Access Bulletin, January issue 2001).</p>
<p>The new law applies to all new IT systems purchased by the US
government from desktop computers and software to office equipment.
Companies that fail to meet accessibility standards may no longer
be allowed to sell to federal agencies.</p>
<p>Implementation of the law has been shrouded in confusion, as
public bodies are unsure of how the rules will apply to existing
web sites and services. On the face of it, the law will not be
retrospective, but under conditions applying to 'indefinite
quantity contracts' new work on existing projects could be
vulnerable to legal action. Accordingly, some bodies are preparing
to shut down existing sites as they seek clarification.</p>
<p>Mike Paciello, founder of the technology accessibility group
WebABLE<br />
(<a href="http://www.webable.com">http://www.webable.com</a>) says
one of the key problems for US government agencies is a lack of
expertise. "There are not enough experts available to help federal
agencies achieve the accessibility goals. Several agencies just did
not prepare well for this mandate. As a result, many are scrambling
and panicking. That causes chaos, stress, and usually results in
poor quality product development."</p>
<p>Companies are being forced to take the issue of accessibility
seriously as they fear losing federal contracts. It's not just
about the web, it's everything - hardware, software, networks,
documentation, and help systems.</p>
<p>The picture is not all bleak, however: "Section 508 is building
awareness of accessibility issues for the blind at unprecedented
levels. I believe it will encourage greater collaboration between
the blind, government agencies, and industry to achieve optimal
accessibility performance and productivity. Web designers are
beginning to realize that the more they test their sites with blind
co-workers and clients, they can develop truly accessible web
interfaces".</p>
<p>The regulations allow individuals with disabilities to file a
complaint against any federal agency that has not complied with the
standards. For more information see:<br />

<p><strong>UK GOVERNMENT GATEWAY MAY</strong><br />
<strong>OVERSTEP THE LAW.</strong></p>
<p>The UK government Gateway, a Microsoftdesigned web site where
people can sign up for egovernment services, may be in breach of
law<br />
protecting disabled people from discrimination.</p>
<p>According to Australian access consultant Tom Worthington design
faults in the Gateway (<a href=
"http://www.gateway.gov.uk">http://www.gateway.gov.uk</a>) may mean
it contravenes a law that requires government bodies to provide the
same standard of service to all.</p>
<p>Worthington was speaking at a seminar in London last week
organised by the RNIB. Last year he contributed to a court case
that found that the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic
Games breached Australian law by providing a web site largely
inaccessible to the blind (see E-Access Bulletin, May 2001).</p>
<p>This week another leading accessibility commentator, Kevin Carey
of HumanITy, urged all major software suppliers including Microsoft
to build accessibility into all their products from the outset,
since the fragmented specialist access software marketplace was not
a proper solution for most people's needs.</p>
<p>Writing in this month's E-Access Bulletin Carey said if the
current Disability Discrimination Act was not strong enough to
force the software and hardware giants to comply, the law should be
tightened up further (see section three, this issue).</p>
<p><strong>BALLOT BOX ACCESS IMPROVES.</strong></p>
<p>Scope, a disability charity focusing on cerebral palsy, has
recognised a "marked improvement" in access to voting for blind and
visually impaired people following a survey of disabled people's
experiences in the recent UK general election.</p>
<p>The election was the first since the Representation of the
People Act made new tactile voting devices mandatory. "The overall
picture was somewhat different from what we had expected", a
spokesperson for the charity said. "Cases of bad access were more
isolated."</p>
<p>The conclusion was based on a preliminary review of responses to
Polls Apart 3<br />
(<a href="http://www.pa3.org.uk">http://www.pa3.org.uk</a>), a
survey of access problems at polling stations led by Scope. So far
volunteers have sent in around 1,000 responses from over 400
constituencies, or 61% of the total.</p>
<p><strong>TECHSHARE 2001 OPENS ITS DOORS TO</strong><br />
<strong>ALL.</strong></p>
<p>The RNIB is opening up its regular internal 'Techshare'
conference on access to technology by blind and visually impaired
people to a wider audience.</p>
<p>For the first time, Techshare 2001 will be open for all to
attend, including all professionals who work in the field of visual
impairment, or have an active interest in technology and how it
facilitates independent access to education, employment, lifelong
learning and society for visually impaired people.</p>
<p>Delegates are also expected from government, statutory bodies,
the ICT marketplace and the voluntary sector, creating what should
be the most influential UK forum to debate technology access
issues.</p>
<p>The conference is to be held on 27-28 November 2001 at Jury's
Inn, Birmingham. Cost is 90 UK pounds for one day or 150 pounds for
two days. For more details or to apply telephone 024-7636 9548 or

<p><strong>SUNLIGHT SENSITIVITY � APPEAL FOR</strong><br />
<strong>ASSISTANCE.</strong></p>
<p>An E-Access Bulletin reader in California, R De La Vega, writes
to appeal for information about any devices people are aware of to
help his young daughter who suffers from poor vision and sunlight
sensitivity.</p>
<p>"I can't find anything to help her to see better. Everywhere I
go they never have anything that will help her to see better in the
sun", he says. If readers have any advice, with web links if
possible to any recommended products, please email Dan Jellinek on

<p><strong>ACCESS TIP � THE MOUSE THAT</strong><br />
<strong>MAGNIFIES.</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking to renew your computer mouse, E-Access
Bulletin reader writes in with a tip: there is one model with a
handy accessibility aid that is actually among the cheapest on the
market.</p>
<p>The Classic Mouse Standard from Dexin<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.dexin.com.tw/classic-big.htm">http://www.dexin.com.tw/classic-big.htm</a>)
has a third, central, button, which operates a magnifier. The level
of magnification can be set to suit the user and it is useful for
reading e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Placing the cursor at the beginning of text and pressing the
centre button creates a small, rectangular window, showing enlarged
text a few letters at a time. Holding down the button and scrolling
horizontally, or vertically, moves the magnifier across the text
and enables the user to read even the dots in email addresses. The
mouse is available from many retailers for around 10 UK pounds or
less.</p>

Cain on <a href=

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: SPECIAL FEATURE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ACCESS COSTS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TIME TO STOP THE CYCLE OF SPIRALLING</strong><br />
<strong>COSTS.</strong><br />
By Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>The plummeting cost of computer technology means the cost of
getting reliable access to the Internet at home has fallen
dramatically for most. Not so for the blind, a group who have more
to gain than most from the net's liberating potential.</p>
<p>Sighted people pay an initial cost of little more than 300 UK
pounds for a minimum specification computer to get hooked up to the
Internet at home, and can then expect to spend around 200 pounds a
year for their connection. But the blind, and those who support
them, have to find nearly 2,500 pounds a person, followed by as
much as 800 pounds a year to maintain their connection and keep
their computer skills up to date.</p>
<p>Top quality screen reading software and a computer powerful
enough to run it costs around 900 pounds. A machine with a 133
MHz<br />
processor, 20 megabytes of memory and 30 megabytes of hard disc
space is needed to run this software, costing around 300 pounds �
so far, not bad. But ironically, the easiest and most flexible
screen reading packages to use are also the most expensive. Top of
the range solutions include 'JAWS' - Job Access With Speech<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.hj.com/JAWS/JAWS.html">http://www.hj.com/JAWS/JAWS.html</a>)
and Window-eyes<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.gwmicro.com/windoweyes/windowe">http://www.gwmicro.com/windoweyes/windowe</a>
yes.htm), which cost 585 pounds and 400 pounds respectively.</p>
<p>On top of these initial costs, blind users also need to finance
essential ongoing software costs sighted people do not incur:
yearly updates to screen-reading software often cost around 100
pounds each.</p>
<p>There are a number of organisations providing grants to help
blind people in the UK to purchase computer hardware for home use.
Among them are Leonard Cheshire (<a href=
"http://www.leonardcheshire">http://www.leonardcheshire</a>. org),
which helps disabled find work;<br />
Electronic Aid for Blind People<br />
(<a href="http://www.eabnet.org.uk">http://www.eabnet.org.uk</a>),
subject to a rigorous selection procedure; and Action for Blind
People (<a href=
"http://www.afbp.org/homepage.htm">http://www.afbp.org/homepage.htm</a>)
which provides 400 top-up grants of up to 300 pounds to people who
have found funding elsewhere.</p>
<p>For the visually impaired, the bulk of the expense of getting
online is not the technology but the specialist training and
technical support needed to operate it. Like any specialist
training, it does not come cheap.</p>
<p>A skills shortage, particularly acute in the area of access
technology, combined with a backlog of people wanting training,
mean this already expensive services are only likely to get more
so. Access training is particularly expensive because it has to be
one-to-one, usually with a trainer who is blind themselves.</p>
<p>According to Mark Prouse, technology advisor at the RNIB, most
new users need five days of oneto -one training before they can go
it alone. At 300 pounds a day, the sum charged by the RNIB, this
brings the total initial training cost to 1,500 pounds. For those
wanting to top up their computing knowledge so they can tackle
ongoing problems, another two days a year may be needed, costing
600 pounds.</p>
<p>Government help in gaining access training for blind people is
provided on the condition that it is needed to get a job. Maria
Lennox, a Jobcentre disabled employment advisor, said those hoping
to take advantage of vocational training must go through an
"in-depth assessment", before being offered residential training at
an RNIB centre in Redhill. "I haven't sent anybody in the last six
months," Lennox said.</p>
<p>As in the UK, people in the US need to prove that Internet
access is needed in the workplace before the state will pay for
training. Psychologist Nancy Badger, an E-Access Bulletin reader
based in the US, said she received a week's free vocational JAWS
training through the Services for the Blind section of the US
Vocational Rehabilitation Government Agency.</p>
<p>While the RNIB does not subsidise its training programmes,
regional charities do offer cut price training IT training. One
such organisation is the Brighton Society for the Blind<br />
(<a href="http://www.bsblind.co.uk">http://www.bsblind.co.uk</a>)
which provides vocational computer training for registered blind
people at a price to the client of just over 20 pounds a day.</p>
<p>According to director Gloria Wright funding the training service
costs the charity 20,000 pounds a year despite a subsidy from the
government's Employment Service, which until recently sent local
people to the centre rather than to the RNIB at Redhill. Though no
longer contracted to the Employment Service, Wright said the
society is considering alternative ways of contributing to the the
training.</p>
<p>In general, the stringent conditions attached to government help
for blind people to have ready access to technology risks creating
a situation whereby blind people can't receive assistance unless
they prove they are actively seeking work, but they can't seek work
without the technology skills. With 71% of blind people of working
age not in employment, it is in everyone's interest, not least the
taxpayer's, to ensure this cycle is broken.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: OPINION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UNIVERSAL ACCESS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMMERCIAL SECTOR MUST BE DRIVEN</strong><br />
<strong>TO BUILD IN ACCESSIBILITY.</strong><br />
By Kevin Carey, Director, HumanITy<br />
<a href="mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a></p>
<p>A few years ago I caused something of a stir at the 'Sight
Village' visual impairment conference by asking some
representatives of Microsoft why the company was bothering to go
through the tedious and somewhat chancey process of handing over
its software code to accessibility developers, in order to make its
products accessible. Why, I asked, didn't it just build in
accessibility features in its own products from the outset?</p>
<p>The disingenuous answer I received was that Microsoft didn't
want to put small developers out of business, a rather odd
statement given the firm's appetite for putting its rivals out of
business.</p>
<p>Leaving aside, for a moment, the question of Braille, there
really is no reason why major software developers can't provide
such good synthetic speech, screen magnification and screen reading
features built into their products that we don't need to bother
with the niche market access suppliers. For all its faults - and
they are well enough known - you would bet on Microsoft producing
the goods and surviving over any access supplier, even the mighty
Freedom Scientific (<a href=
"http://www.freedomscientific.com">http://www.freedomscientific.com</a>).</p>
<p>This is not to say that the accessibility sector is not
committed, even heroic. Some of its enthusiasts are almost
missionary in their zeal, but the marketplace as a whole is fragile
and ramshackle and ultimately investment and reliability are more
important than improvisation and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>That, at any rate, has long been my theoretical framework but it
was given a huge practical boost by two recent events, both
involving the products of a major access software developer.</p>
<p>In the first, one of the world's leading access technology
academics and I wasted hours failing to add a Braille display to an
access package producing speech. A third of the way round the world
from the product's manufacturer, with a proportionate eight hour
time difference, we would not have been able to access telephone
support even if we could have afforded it.</p>
<p>The second event was the arrival of my wonderful new Sony Vaio
laptop computer, a present from Sony for some work I had done for
the company. My local fixer soon ascertained that my access package
would need a major and expensive upgrade because the machine came
with<br />
Windows 2000. I asked him to put in Windows '98 and install my old
access package but the Vaio's drivers weren't having any of that.
Result - lovely new laptop in a box.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that legislation on both sides of the Atlantic
will put a stop to the mainstream fiddling with access and the
niche market struggling. If we could overcome the irrational
prejudice of the elite in favour of an overcomplex, contracted
Grade II Braille diktat, the simpler alphabetic Grade I Braille
could be simply dropped into a style sheet. After all, if you can
convert the standard computer character system ASCII 256 into a
huge combination of pixels, you ought to be able to convert a
quarter of that number of characters into six pixels, which is
essentially what Braille is.</p>
<p>The visual impairment sector cannot go on like this. Major
agencies like the RNIB are plagued by niche developers who are at
once wheedling and defensive, wanting grants but resenting
competition. We need to find out if the UK's Disability
Discrimination Act is strong enough to force the commercial sector
and the government to make its information accessible which will,
in turn, force them to put pressure on their software suppliers.
And if the law is not up to it, then it needs to be changed.</p>
<p>[Section three ends.]</p>
<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: SPECIAL FEATURE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DESIGN BASICS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE WEB IS ABOUT COMMUNICATION,</strong><br />
<strong>NOT TECHNOLOGY.</strong></p>
<p>Clarity of style and design in a web site are important for all
audiences, not just for visually impaired web users. The golden
rule of clear web site design is to decide what you want your site
to do, and then use technology to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Too many designers find out what technology can do first and
then try think of something to do with it. But a web site is a
means of communication, not a way of showing off your technical
knowledge.</p>
<p>There are several basic ground rules for good site navigation.
When a visitor comes to your site, it should be clear straight away
to whom the site belongs; what purpose the site serves; and how to
contact the people behind the site. If you are tempted to only put
an email address and no phone number or postal address, remember
that you may be asked for these details regularly through emails,
so you will waste your time replying; and having a phone number and
'reallife' address will reassure visitors that you are a genuine
organisation.</p>
<p>However you organise your site, try to make sure that the
structure is as logical as possible; and that there is a back-up
(such as a guide to the site, or a 'site map') for visitors who
can't find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Remember that visitors may not always enter your site at the
home page. For example, they may be following a link to one of the
other pages on your site, or they may have found another page
through a search engine.</p>
<p>This means it is a good idea if every page on your site has
clear links to basic information about your organisation or
subject; a guide to pages on the site (often called a 'site map');
and contact information for you or your organisation. Try also to
make it easy for visitors to find which parts of your site you have
changed recently.</p>
<p>A good guideline that many web designers use is that you should
be able to get from any page on your site to any other page with
just three clicks of a mouse.</p>
<p>When you use pieces of text as a link, try to avoid just using
the words 'click here'. This is because visually impaired people
using a screen reader, which converts the text on a website to
speech, will only hear the words used for the link. Just hearing
'click here' will not give any idea what the link is for.</p>
<p>When using pictures and images, try to use 'thumbnails'. These
are small copies of a picture that the visitor can click on to then
see a full-sized copy. This saves them having to wait for unwanted
images to download to full size.</p>
<p>Always remember to include an 'Alt description tag' with the
picture. This is a piece of text that appears in place of the
picture if the visitor has their computer set to not show pictures.
It also allows people with visual problems who are using
screen-readers to know what the picture shows.</p>
<p>If your design package allows it, make sure to set the height
and width of the image. This means that when the page loads, the
visitor's computer will leave a space for the image and load the
text first. The visitor can then start reading the page without
having to wait for the image to load.</p>
<p>Many sites feature a 'splash' page. This is a page that appears
when somebody first visits your site which displays a large image
or animation and then takes you to the home page. This is useful if
you want to create a particular first impression, but is a bad idea
if the page takes a long time to load.</p>
<p>Remember that most web designers have better computers and
faster connections to the Internet than most ordinary visitors to
your site. What takes a couple of seconds to load on a fast
computer can cause a frustrating wait for others. If you do use an
animated 'splash page', always give people the opportunity to skip
past the animation and go straight to the rest of your site.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do hire outside help for your site, remember one
golden rule. The designer is there to produce what you have asked
for, not to use your site to show off what they can do!</p>
