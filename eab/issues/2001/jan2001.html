<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>OPEN UNIVERSITY LAUNCHES UK'S</strong><br />
<strong>LARGEST ASSISTIVE LEARNING</strong><br />
<strong>TECHNOLOGY CENTRE.</strong></p>
<p>The Open University is to create a Centre for Assistive
Technology and Enabling Research (CATER) for disabled students,
backed by one million UK Pounds from the Higher Education Funding
Council for England, in the largest project of its kind so far in
the UK.</p>
<p>The OU is Britain's largest university, with more than 200,000
students undertaking its part-time distance learning courses.
Currently more than 7,000 of its students have disabilities, and
the numbers are growing.</p>
<p>CATER will build on and develop the<br />
University's existing work on assistive technologies to facilitate
the learning of disabled students.</p>
<p>This will include developing learning resources and
communication methods; developing new technology based services for
students; carrying out research to ensure that these services
remain appropriate to the needs of disabled learners; technical
support; and the creation of an Access Centre to conduct needs
assessments for disabled students and staff and provide advice and
training on equipment.</p>
<p>Specific projects will include further development of the
university's ongoing DREAM (Digitally Recorded Educational Audio
Materials) project to replace analogue audio recording of course
materials with digital recording, to enhance their quality,
interactivity and accessibility.</p>
<p>The university is looking to recruit a person to head the new
centre. The appointment is initially for a three-year period, after
which the HEFCE funding runs out, so an important part of the job
will be to generate income to enable the centre's continuation.</p>
<p>The post has a salary range of 32,000-37,000 UK Pounds, and t he
closing date for application is 30 January 2001. Further
information from 01908 858251 or contact Liz McCarthy on 01908
653044 for further particulars in large print, computer disk, or
audio cassette. Applicants who are deaf or hard of hearing can call
a Minicom answerphone on 01908 654901.</p>

<p><strong>US GOVERNMENT SETS STANDARDS FOR</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESS.</strong></p>
<p>The US Access Board, an independent agency that promotes access
to services by people with disabilities across the whole of US
federal government, has issued new accessibility standards for
information technology and consumer electronics.</p>
<p>The standards have been produced under a 1998 amendment to
section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which strengthened existing
provisions covering access to government information. The finalised
standards, issued in December 2000 following a consultation
process, are legally binding and will become part of the Federal
Acquisition Regulations.</p>
<p>The standards apply to the full range of technologies used by US
government<br />
departments and agencies, including the design of web sites.
Technology developed or acquired for a federal agency by a
contractor must also comply. However, the standards carry a rider
clause: "A federal agency does not have to comply with the
technology accessibility standards if it would impose an undue
burden to do so."</p>
<p>The Access Board is now developing training materials to help
people understand and comply with the new standards, including fact
sheets, practical 'how-to' tips on making web sites accessible to
people with disabilities, and comprehensive annotated lists of
reference materials.</p>

<p><strong>LISTEN TO IVAN.</strong></p>
<p>In the latest development in the voice-activated web arena, a
character called IVAN � Intelligent Voice Animated Navigator -
could help blind people navigate the Internet without a
keyboard.</p>
<p>Users of IVAN describe aloud the topic they are interested in
and the navigator � a cartoon icon that looks like a little globe
with arms and legs - will find relevant websites, verbally list
them and guide the searcher through them. If IVAN doesn't
understand what you're looking for, it will ask for
clarification.</p>
<p>Users need to download a piece of free software over the web and
buy a compatible headset with microphone. You may already own a
headset � the 'FAQ' section of the 'myIVAN' web site has details of
compatibility. Once you're plugged in, IVAN will run a short
training session to help him understand the nuances of your
voice.</p>
<p>Its developer, US-based One Voice<br />
Technologies, says IVAN works on mobile telephones and other
wireless appliances as well as PCs. See:<br />

<p><strong>NYSTAGMUS AND COMPUTER USE.</strong></p>
<p>The Nystagmus Network is planning to compile an information
sheet about the use of computers by children and others who suffer
from this eye condition.</p>
<p>Nystagmus is characterised by rapid, jerky eye movements, and
may cause difficulties in viewing computer screens. The network is
seeking tips and advice from anyone with any experience of the
condition on what sorts of computers and software may be easiest to
use; and what other relevant information resources may exist on the
web or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Anyone who can help should email acting chairman John Sanders on
<a href="mailto:eyesitejs@msn.com">eyesitejs@msn.com</a></p>

<p><strong>IMMERSION WINS US PATENT FOR</strong><br />
<strong>TACTILE WEB.</strong></p>
<p>The Immersion Corporation, developer of the 'TouchSense' tactile
computer mouse, has been granted a US patent for its system of
enabling tactile 'force feedback' for web pages.</p>
<p>Immersion's software tools allow web<br />
developers to embed touch elements in a page that are converted by
the TouchSense mouse into different kinds of vibration or pressure
on the user's fingertips. They can be used on computer desktops and
in gaming software as well as on the Internet, enabling users to
physically experience interactions with menus, icons, windows and
other web page elements.</p>
<p>Tactile cues range from simple pressure to highlight when a
cursor moves over an animated button, to the addition of different
'textures' to products that are offered for sale online.</p>
<p>TouchSense-enabled computer mice � also known as 'haptic' mice -
include the iFeel Mouse from Logitech (<a href=
"http://www.logitech.com">http://www.logitech.com</a>) which uses
different kinds of vibrations. Other TouchSense technologies work
by making the cursor an extension of the hand.</p>
<p>Immersion has developed a suite of software tools that enables
web developers to add tactile feedback to web pages. They are
available free at:<br />

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: SPECIAL FOCUS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DEAFBLINDNESS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SOLUTIONS TO A COMPLEX</strong><br />
<strong>COMMUNICATION PROBLEM.</strong></p>
<p>The term deafblindness reflects a number of different states of
sensory impairment. The 1988 RNIB report 'Breaking through' defined
the condition as "a severe degree of combined visual and auditory
impairment, resulting in problems of communication, information and
mobility".</p>
<p>It is important to remember that deafblindness is a disability
in itself, and more than the sum of the parts of being visually
impaired and hearing impaired: the effects of the hearing
impairment modify and multiply the effects of the visual
impairment, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The largest group of deafblind people are people aged around 65
or older who have acquired sensory impairments late in life and who
have been used to an independent lifestyle. People who lose their
hearing or sight later in life, particularly if they have residual
hearing and vision, are often unlikely to label themselves as
deafblind and may think services aimed at deafblind people are not
relevant to them.</p>
<p>Other causes of deafblindness include serious accidents; the
genetic condition Usher Syndrome; and congenital deafblindness
resulting from an illness such as Rubella or due to
prematurity.</p>
<p>Deafblindness has a major impact on a person's mobility, ability
to communicate and access to information. Deafblind people
experience the world very suddenly and without warning. For
example, a deafblind person will not know that you are approaching
them, or are near them, until you touch them. They will not be
aware of the processes required to do something unless they are
specifically shown that process, and this will have an impact on
how they interact with the world.</p>
<p>The main factor affecting how a deafblind person communicates is
whether they possess a spoken language such as English, or a
non-spoken language such as sign language, as a first language.</p>
<p>Communication methods based on English include 'Block', where
letters of the alphabet are drawn onto the deafblind person's hand
with a finger. 'Deafblind manual' is another tactile language where
letters of the alphabet are represented by touching the deafblind
person's hand. For example, touching the top of the deafblind
person's thumb represents the letter 'A'.</p>
<p>In a high-tech twist to these manual solutions, some research
groups are developing mechanical hands that can convert digital
text into manual signs that can be felt by deafblind people as with
a human hand, although these solutions are not yet available
commercially.</p>
<p>For some people a hearing aid can help and an induction loop
installed in a room will assist hearing-aid users by picking up and
transmitting sound from the room direct to the hearing aid, and
stripping out background noise. However, loops frequently suffer
technical problems. It may be that they are not switched on and are
used so rarely that no one knows how to activate them. In other
cases they are not installed correctly and will receive
interference from equipment such as PCs.</p>
<p>There are other types of hearing aid, but generally when
speaking to someone wearing a hearing aid a person should not
shout, but talk clearly and at a normal speed.</p>
<p>Communication methods based on other<br />
languages include 'restricted sign language', used with people who
have some vision. An interpreter signs in a restricted space in
front of the deafblind person in their field of vision.</p>
<p>With 'hands-on signing', the deafblind person puts their hands
on the interpreter's hands while the interpreter signs what is
being said. Again, it is based on standard sign language but uses a
restricted or slightly modified version.</p>
<p>For face to face situations, a computer can help with the
conversation. If the person reads Braille then special programs can
be used to control a Braille display (one such is 'S-Com',
developed by a deafblind person). The screen is split into two. The
main part of the screen is used for the interpreter or speaker to
type what they want to say. The bottom line of the screen is viewed
using the Braille display.</p>
<p>The 'Tellatouch' is a portable (but quite bulky) device with a
QWERTY keyboard and a single Braille cell. In addition, computers
with refreshable Braille displays attached can be used to talk to a
deafblind Braille reader.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a standard word processing program
with speech and Braille output. This allows the better
magnification facilities available under Windows to be used for
people with some residual vision, and to provide communication
using speech and Braille together.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using a PC is that a sighted or
visually impaired person can talk to a deafblind person directly
without knowledge of specialist communication methods. It is also
faster and less tiring than speaking through an interpreter.</p>
<p>For telephone contact a deafblind person might use a phone
system with Braille output or a textphone with a large or magnified
display. Direct conversations are possible if both people have a
minicom or use RNID Typetalk, the national telephone relay
service<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.rnid-typetalk.org.uk/">http://www.rnid-typetalk.org.uk/</a>).</p>
<p>A phone conversation of this kind will take longer than an
ordinary phone call and it will take time to become accustomed to
talking via an intermediary. People using a textphone to
communicate with a deafblind person should think carefully about
the words that they use. It should be remembered that the listener
cannot pick up any voice inflexions and nuances of emotion may not
therefore be apparent.</p>
<p>In all communication with deafblind people, it is necessary to
have some options from which to choose the most appropriate method
for the situation, and to have a contingency plan in case one
method fails. For further information on deafblindness see James
Gallagher's awardwinning 'A-Z to deafblindness' site at:<br />

<h1><a name="section-1." id="section-1.">* Article by Cathy Rundle,
RNIB. This article is</a></h1>
adapted from a paper given at the RNIB's 'Techshare' conference on
30 November-1 December 2000 (see also E-Access Bulletin, issue 12).

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: CASE STUDY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'SORT IT!'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GIVING A VOICE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.</strong></p>
<p>Blind and partially sighted children and young people want to
watch television, read books, play video games, go out with friends
and plan careers � in other words, to do all the things that their
peer groups do.</p>
<p>But it may not be that easy. According to 'Shaping the future',
the first ever survey of the experiences of more than 1,000
visually impaired children aged between five and 25, one in three
feel excluded from many classroom activities and more than one in
four reported bullying.</p>
<p>Late last year the RNIB, which carried out the survey, launched
a new web site aimed at 11-16 year olds with serious sight problems
to try to address some of these issues in an accessible way.</p>
<p>'Sort it!', at <a href=
"http://www.sortit.org.uk">http://www.sortit.org.uk</a>, draws
together a range of social and educational resources for young
people while highlighting the problems of visual impairment and how
they can be dealt with.</p>
<p>"The feeling behind the creation of the site was that children
and young people enjoy using the Internet but there's not a great
deal for blind and visually impaired people that is fully
accessible and fun", says Becca Bryant, RNIB<br />
Communications Manager and one of a small team charged with
maintaining the site.</p>
<p>The site's launch generated extensive media interest,
particularly among young people's magazines. As a result it is
already receiving around two thousand hits a month.</p>
<p>Content includes a section headed 'Your voice', which explains
to young people their rights under legislation such as the
Disability Discrimination Act, and how to enforce them. There is
also advice on how to obtain help at school, and from other
sources.</p>
<p>A 'What's on' section includes information on 'Let's go!', a
quarterly guide to cultural events such as galleries where you can
touch the exhibits, days out and holidays.</p>
<p>The 'Braille trail' includes information about how and where to
get text books and magazines in Braille, tape or large type. The
RNIB publishes two magazines for 12-15 year olds - 'Sugar and
Spice' and 'Slugs and Snails' - with the latest celebrity gossip,
pop news and sport. They cost 32 pence each, although they cannot
yet be ordered online.</p>
<p>Interactivity is a key feature - throughout the site youngsters
are encouraged to join mailing lists, enter competitions or send in
their own ideas, comments, reviews and opinions.</p>
<p>The idea is that the feedback received will help the RNIB in
future campaigns for increased use of Braille resources in schools,
greater participation in sports for the blind and the need to give
teachers in mainstream schools visual awareness training.</p>
<p>Interactive features include a message board where users can ask
for help with homework, projects, share news about computer games
or find new networks of friends to share<br />
experiences with.</p>
<p>Young people do seem to be using the board already to swap
stories about their experiences, exchange ideas, and equally
importantly, to let off steam. One typical message under the
heading 'aaaaaaaaaah!' reads: "Hey do any of you guys find that
teachers always ask the support teachers if things need enlarging?
And they always enlarge stuff that was fine, and they always tell
you what you can see and what you can't instead of asking. I HATE
IT!"</p>
<p>The message elicited a sympathetic response: "Yes, it absolutely
annoys me. Do they ever think they should ask us?"</p>
<p>Following the success of the message board, the Sort it! team
has plans to set up some kind of live chat facility, although they
currently lack the funds. The team is shortly to set about seeking
corporate sponsorship for the site as a whole.</p>
<p>Other plans to expand the site include a section about careers
and how to get ahead, which will profile successful people both
with and without sight problems. They are also going to invite
celebrity chefs to suggest recipes that are easy for blind and
partially sighted people to follow.</p>
<p>Currently on the site Comedian Harry Hill recalls
light-heartedly what it was like for him growing up with poor
eyesight, and promises to come round and sort out the bullies at
your school.</p>
<p>[Section three ends]</p>
<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'vOICe'.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CAN YOU HEAR THAT PAINTING OVER</strong><br />
<strong>THERE?</strong></p>
<p>The sensation of 'hearing' colours in a painting or the depth of
a room is described by the volunteer developers of 'vOICe', a piece
of 'video sonification' software that creates 'soundscapes' of a
person's environment.</p>
<p>"The vOICe [brought] my hallway from a blurry image in my mind's
eye to what seems like actual dimensional sight", says Pat
Fletcher, a volunteer from the US who is testing the technology.
Fletcher was blinded in later life, and so has memories of
vision.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter to me that my ears are causing the sight to
occur in my mind. What matters is that the soundscapes are
triggering a pathway for me to see again."</p>
<p>The vOICe system works by translating images from a miniature
'eye-ball' PC camera or webcam into sounds. Different shapes create
different sounds and even colours sound different. Once a user is
accustomed to the vOICe, they can begin to comprehend more complex
or moving scenes simply by listening to them.</p>
<p>The system was invented by Peter Meijer, a senior computer chip
scientist working for Philips Research in Holland<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.research.philips.com">http://www.research.philips.com</a>).
The vOICe project is a subsidiary activity that he runs in his
spare time and at his own expense, although Philips has supported
him in publishing material related to the technology.</p>
<p>Fletcher is the first user to embark on fully immersive use of
the vOICe, using a mobile set up and wearing it every day. For
about six months she has been wearing a head-mounted webcam
(sported, Cyclops-like, on the forehead), stereo headphones, a
microphone for speech commands and a powerful notebook PC inside a
backpack running the vOICe software.</p>
<p>She found that once she became accustomed to it, the system
added depth to practical activities. In one testimony posted onto
the web, she says: "One day I was washing the dishes and turned to
get a towel to dry my hands. When I turned back to the sink, I was
stunned to see it in a depth-like image. I stepped away from the
sink and walked slowly up to it again to see if my mind was playing
tricks on me. But, no, the feeling of seeing depth in the sink bowl
was still there. I can now also stand in doorways of the rooms in
my house and sense the depth of the room. I can't yet feel this
when I am walking, but it is there when I am standing still."</p>
<p>Meijer says that because no congenitally blind people have so
far undergone fully immersive trials, it is hard to say whether
such users would experience the same sense of depth. "But if the
sense of depth is due to visual perspective, then one could argue
that a congenitally blind person might learn it just as well as a
late-blinded person," he says. "Visual perspective is a matter of
optics, governed by physical laws and mathematical rules. There is
no 'magic' to it, except perhaps in the speed and ease with which
sighted people have learned to make sense of it, even in visually
cluttered scenes."</p>
<p>The system can have its drawbacks, however, as Fletcher found
when she tried to listen to music on a portable CD player while
doing her housework. "While standing still, it was no problem. But
when I began to walk around, suddenly I was stumbling into walls
and over tables. I couldn't believe how clumsy I was being. Then it
hit me that the CD was not giving me the information I had grown
accustomed to from the vOICe. I had to concentrate while wearing
the portable CD headphones � it was like being blinded again."</p>
<p>As well as acting as a navigational aid, vOICe could also help
visually impaired people to gain some kind of feel for visual items
such as photographs, drawings, signs, graphs or pictograms, by
providing information on perspective and colour.</p>
<p>Meijer describes another experiment in which development
volunteer David Poehlman pointed his camera around and at his
fingers, and across the Internet Meijer and Fletcher listened to
the live soundscapes from his hand and heard his fingers moving in
front of the camera, "in my case at a distance of thousands of
miles across the Atlantic".</p>
<p>He says different blind people might stand to gain different
things from vOICe. "For some it may be their first direct and
interactive relationship with visual experience, possibly
fulfilling a curiosity to learn about visual perspective,
occlusion, parallax, shading and so on beyond the accounts that
they got from sighted people. For those who lost eyesight later in
life the reasons may again be very different. It can also be just a
tool to gain access to graphs or to tell the colours of objects by
means of the built-in colour identifier".</p>
<p>vOICe is available free for non-commercial purposes, although
Meijer warns it is not an easy technology to use: "Vision is a
complex mode of perception, involving a lot of learning and
adaptation. Mastering the vOICe requires lots of effort and
practice, perhaps comparable to learning a foreign language."</p>
