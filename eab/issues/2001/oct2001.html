<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EU STEPS UP DRIVE FOR ACCESSIBILITY.</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission is urging other European institutions
and member states to abide by the World Wide Web Consortium's Web
Accessibility Initiative guidelines, on the back of a major new
research funding drive (see section two, this issue).</p>
<p>The commission said last month that the EU's office of
publications has launched a pilot project to make European treaties
accessible to people with visual impairment. Europa, the main EU
site (<a href=
"http://www.europa.eu.int">http://www.europa.eu.int</a>), will
"adopt the guidelines" from the end of this year, the commission
said.</p>
<p>Adoption of the guidelines, however, does not mean the site
itself will be good enough to be awarded a World Wide Web
Consortium 'web accessibility initiative' kite mark (<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/wai">http://www.w3.org/wai</a>). "It is one
thing to adopt the guidelines and another thing to apply them," a
spokesperson said. One difficulty posed by the overhauling of
Europa is that it is designed and maintained by a large number of
independent groups.</p>
<p>An EU inter-services group on disabilities plans to build a web
site giving all European agencies useful information about
accessible design to a large number of independent designers
responsible for the Europa web site. If opened up to developers
beyond the European institutions as planned, the site could help
further the commission's mission to encourage member states to take
accessibility seriously.</p>
<p>The European Commission has already invested 2.5 million euros
in research into Internet access for the visually impaired (see
section two).</p>
<p><strong>BANKS ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS POOR ACCESS
RECORD.</strong></p>
<p>A new guide to help banks improve online services for the blind
and visually impaired is to be launched next week by the British
Bankers Association in association with the RNIB.</p>
<p>An earlier report published by the RNIB last year, 'Get the
message online', had found that all banks surveyed failed to reach
the most basic standards of accessibility in their web services.
The BBA subsequently requested a meeting to ask how they could get
it right, and the new report is the result of that process.</p>
<p>RNIB researchers examined how easy it would be for a blind user
to set up a current account online. Six banks, which have requested
to remain anonymous, offered privileged access to accounts and
worked with visually impaired people to carry out user testing over
a six-month period.</p>
<p>"The number one type of site we receive complaints about are
banking ones," says RNIB Internet campaigns manager Julie Howell.
"Blind people always have to queue inside the bank as the machines
are impossible to use. If you are not confident about using the
technology in the first place the last thing you would want to do
is conduct financial transactions."</p>
<p>'Accessible e-banking' will be available in print, Braille, tape
and electronic formats from the RNIB (<a href=
"http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology">http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology</a>)
and the BBA (<a href=
"http://www.bba.org.uk">http://www.bba.org.uk</a> ).</p>
<p><strong>FIRST YOUNG PEOPLE'S CHAT ROOM OPENS IN
SCOTLAND.</strong></p>
<p>The first Internet chat room service aimed at visually impaired
and blind children has been launched by Visual Impairment Scotland
(<a href=
"http://www.viscotland.org.uk">http://www.viscotland.org.uk</a>), a
new body of experts based at Edinburgh University's Scottish
Sensory Centre.</p>
<p>"We wanted to bring together kids from all over Scotland � many
go to mainstream schools and don't know other children with a
visual impairment," says VIS research and service manager John
Ravenscroft. "We wanted to develop a sense of community from the
Borders to Aberdeen so it doesn't matter if you're the only kid in
school with sight difficulties, you are not isolated - you can come
here and talk about football, movies and kids' stuff."</p>
<p>The initiative, funded by the Scottish Executive, started a
month ago and has about 30 children registered. There are two chat
room areas: one for younger children around eight and another for
those aged up to sixteen. Participants have to join the 'Viskids
Club', open to young people in Scotland with a visual
impairment<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.viscotland.org.uk/textimages/VISKIDS/front.htm">http://www.viscotland.org.uk/textimages/VISKIDS/front.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Ravenscroft says: "In future we would like to set up a voice
activated site but the available software is too expensive and
requires too much downloading time for the kids. At the moment the
system we have gives fast access for everyone, but if we change it
the service will start to become discriminatory as those with
broadband get faster access. If anyone has a solution, I'd be
pleased to hear from them."</p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL TEENAGERS CAMP COMES TO UK.</strong></p>
<p>The ninth International Computer Camp for blind and visually
impaired teenagers is to be held in the UK next year, hosted by the
RNIB.</p>
<p>Around 120 students aged 17-20 from 10 countries will come to
Loughborough Vocational College to take part in workshops on
everything from simple skills like adjusting a computer screen to
making music using computers.</p>
<p>The ICC project is led by the Computer Science for the Blind
team at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria (<a href=
"http://www.mvblind.unilinz">http://www.mvblind.unilinz</a>. ac.at)
and has expanded to include some 21 partner countries. The first
three camps were held in Austria, followed by the Netherlands,
France, Sweden, Germany and this year in Slovenia.</p>
<p>Any student can apply to attend the camp, although only 12 will
be selected from each country next year. Applicants should already
have basic keyboard skills and an interest in technology, and
should speak English.</p>
<p>A web site on next year's event will go live at the end of
October [note at the time of writing this site is not yet live] at:
<a href=
"http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology/icc">http://www.rnib.org.uk/technology/icc</a><br />

and potential UK applicants, who should not have attended a
previous RNIB summer camp, should email Angela Dinning on <a href=
"mailto:angela.dinning@rnib.org.uk">angela.dinning@rnib.org.uk</a></p>

<p><strong>DANCE GROUP SEEKS TECHNOLOGY ADVICE.</strong></p>
<p>The Manchester-based arts group Touchdown Dance, which runs
community dance workshops and projects for visually impaired and
blind people of all ages, is set to release a CD-ROM on its
work.</p>
<p>The disk will include information on dance workshops and the
group's working methods; a performance section with video clips,
and a section on touch-based work. It will also carry links to
other relevant and partner organisations.</p>
<p>"We hope to provide a full picture of the potential of touch as
a language; this hits back at the hysteria around touch in
educational settings," says the group's director Katy Dymoke.</p>
<p>However she says there have been some technical problems with
making the CD accessible, and would appreciate advice from E-Access
Bulletin readers in a number of areas. "I am struggling to get good
information about the compatibility of software such as voice
translation software and enlargement software.</p>
<p>"The CD-ROM carries mostly text and images with some video clips
and sound. What seems to happen is that [the screen-reader] JAWS
doesn't recognise the text. It has been suggested that the music
file on the CD may compete with JAWS for the sound card, so I need
to find out about compatible software.</p>
<p>"For navigation we are using the arrow keys to move to the home
page, back, next, and exit. We have soft pastel colours behind the
text, and would also like to know if there is any preference for
suitable colours. I imagine it is hard to have a general view on
this but any suggestions are welcome."</p>
<p>Anyone with any advice should email E-Access Bulletin editor Dan
Jellinek on <a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a>
and he will forward it to Katy Dymoke. Touchdown's fledgling

<p><strong>TALKING TEXT MESSAGES LAUNCHED IN ITALY.</strong></p>
<p>Blind people in Italy will soon be able to send and receive text
messages thanks to a new service launched by Telecom Italia Mobile
(TIM) in association with the Italian Union of the Blind (<a href=

<p>TIM (<a href="http://www.tim.it">http://www.tim.it</a>) will
produce GSM cards that are able to translate and send vocal format
messages. A sound signal will indicate an incoming message and the
recipient will dial 49600 to access it. To send a message the user
will key the same number. The service will be provided at no extra
cost.</p>
<p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF:</strong></p>
<p>PATENTLY UNFAIR? - W3C, the Internet standards body, is seeking
the opinions of access developers on its controversial new draft
policy on the potential formation of guidelines in the future that
imply the use of patented technologies. The deadline for feedback
has been extended until tomorrow (11 October) following protests
from the open source lobby: <a href=

<p>DIGITAL DISCRIMINATION: If large companies are found in future
to have discriminated against disabled people by producing
inaccessible web sites, the consequential media coverage could have

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: FOCUS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EUROPEAN COMMISSION.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MILLIONS OF EUROS INVESTED IN WAVE OF
ACCESSIBILITY</strong> <strong>RESEARCH.</strong><br />
By Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>The European Commission's adoption of W3C accessibility
guidelines (see news, this issue) follows a significant new cash
injection by the organisation in this field. In the past nine
months alone it has invested 3.7 million euros, or 2.5 million UK
pounds, in technology accessibility research projects.</p>
<p>The first access project to gain commission backing was 'IRIS',
an initiative that upholds the commission's proud tradition of
acronymic creativity � it stands for 'Incorporating Requirements of
People with Special Needs or Impairments to Internet Based Systems
and Services'. The 1.8 million euro project received commission
funding of 1.2 million euros in January.</p>
<p>By the end of its 30-month lifespan IRIS aims to create a
commercially viable software package and user community to help
designers create accessible web sites. Project leader Nikitas
Tsopelas of Greek web consultancy European Dynamics (<a href=
"http://www.eurodyn.com">http://www.eurodyn.com</a>) said
development would begin in 2002 and that news will be posted to the
project's web site: <a href=
"http://www.iris-design4all.org/progress.htm">http://www.iris-design4all.org/progress.htm</a></p>
<p>According to Tsopelas the last nine months have been spent
assessing user requirements with the assistance of Belgian charity
Information Society disAbilities Challenge (ISdAC, <a href=
"http://www.isdac.org">http://www.isdac.org</a>). According to
IsDAC chairman Tony Verelst, IRIS recently commissioned his
organisation to provide feedback on a web forum.</p>
<p>In August, the commission contributed a further 1.4 million
euros towards a 2.0 million euro project snappily entitled Smart
Interactive Tactile Interface Effecting Graphical Display for the
Visually Impaired. 'ITACTI', as it is thankfully known for short,
is a three-year project to use new 'smart' materials to make
tactile displays and software to drive them from a standard PC.</p>
<p>According to the project's funding statement, "It is expected
that electrorheological fluid will be chosen to facilitate the
production of a matrix of moving dots." The technology referred to
here is that of 'smart' or 'intelligent' fluids that change their
viscosity massively on application of an electronic current,
effectively temporarily solidifying.</p>
<p>The ITACTI project is the only one of the three
commission-backed ITaccess research projects to be led by a
UK-based organisation � the Faculty of Applied Sciences at De
Montfort University (<a href=
"http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Faculties/AS">http://www.dmu.ac.uk/Faculties/AS</a>
). The non-UK members of the ITACTI consortium include Italy's
Associazione Nazionale Subvedenti (<a href=
"http://www.subvedenti.it">http://www.subvedenti.it</a> ), a
charity for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The third and most recent commission-backed accessibility
project is Voice for Information Society Universal Access Learning
(VISUAL), which in September received 1.1 million euros from the
commission towards its 1.6 million euro costs. The project will
last for a year, with the first partners' meeting scheduled for 17
October in Madrid.</p>
<p>VISUAL plans to use VoiceXML technology to develop software to
enable people to design web sites which can navigated by voice. The
group aim to ensure the design software itself is accessible and
compatible with mainstream web design packages.</p>
<p>Among VISUAL's other aims is the creation of a multilingual,
voiceactivated e-learning portal. The cosmopolitan make up of the
VISUAL team may prove useful in achieving this ambition: Keith
Gladstone of the RNIB and Helen Petrie of the University of
Hertfordshire are the only native English speakers in the team.</p>
<p>The initiative is being led by Spanish telecoms technology firm
Soluziona Telecomunicaciones (<a href=
"http://www.ipt.es">http://www.ipt.es</a>), with other participants
including French charity La Fédération des Aveugles et Handicapés
Visuels de France (<a href=
"http://www.faf.asso.fr">http://www.faf.asso.fr</a> ) and German
and Italian charities Deutsche Blinden- und Sehbehindertenverband
(<a href=
"http://home.t-online.de/home/dbsv_">http://home.t-online.de/home/dbsv_</a>)
and Unione Italiana dei Ciechi (<a href=
"http://www.uiciechi.it">http://www.uiciechi.it</a>) and the
European Blind Union (<a href=
"http://www.euroblind.org">http://www.euroblind.org</a>).</p>
<p>All three of these new research projects could prove useful to
the European Commission in its attempt to kick-start the process of
making the web sites of European institutions and member states
accessible. IRIS in particular seems like it could be particularly
useful resource for EU institutions themselves � and who knows, one
day EU sites might be voice-enabled in all official member
languages using VISUAL technology.</p>
<p>[Section two ends.]</p>
<p><strong>SECTION THREE: INTERVIEW.</strong><br />
<strong>-BETA TESTING.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AOL: YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED</strong></p>
<p>Last month we looked at the issues surrounding accessibility
'beta testing', the practice of inviting blind and visually
impaired people and other groups to test pre-release versions of
software for ease of use (see E-Access Bulletin, September 2001).
In particular we looked at concerns raised by the beta testing
process for AOL's new service software, AOL version 7.0. This
month, AOL's director of accessibility Debbie Fletter offers
answers some of these concerns put to her by E-Access Bulletin �
these are reproduced below in a Q and A format.</p>
<p>Q: Which countries are involved in the beta testing?</p>
<ol>
<li>The current beta test focusing on accessibility is for people
accessing the AOL service in the US. Although the beta testing
service is also available in the UK and some other places, each
country has both a different beta area as well as a different
schedule for the release of AOL 7.0 - the AOL software that has the
majority of accessibility improvements. Each country also has
different schedules for accessibility. We have not announced a
schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>We plan to incorporate the improvements for increased
accessibility across our international services as we roll out
future versions of AOL.</p>
<p>Q: Are beta-testers required to submit their credit card numbers
and personal details, and if so, why if the service is being
offered to them free?</p>
<p>AOL can only be accessed through our proprietary software and
service, every one of our more than 400,000 beta testers must have
an AOL account in order to participate. So taking part in this
special offer does require a credit card, as all of our members
must provide one in case additional services are charged to their
accounts, but nothing will be charged to it unless the member adds
additional services or chooses to stay with AOL after a special
free one-year period has ended.</p>
<p>Q: How do you qualify for the free period?</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to be recommended by our Accessibility Advisory
Committee. To gain their approval, a person needs to be a Microsoft
Windows user, and a user of screen readers, screen magnifiers, text
output, voice recognition, or alternatives to keyboard and mice.
Testers must also be willing to report back to us on their AOL
experiences at least once a week for the duration of the beta
test.</li>
<li>How long will the testing period last?</li>
<li>AOL will contact testers when the beta test is complete.</li>
<li>Is there any automatic mechanism build into the site to
terminate membership when the beta test period ends?</li>
<li>We hope that most of our beta testers enjoy our service and
decide to stay as AOL members after the one-year ends, but if a
beta tester chooses not to do so, they can call our member services
representatives at 1-888- 265-8008 or go to keyword: Cancel.</li>
<li>Is there any documentation that testers can retain to prove
they have terminated their membership?</li>
<li>They can ask the member services representative to send a
confirmation if they choose to do so.</li>
<li>Are personal details and credit card details verified or stored
for future use?</li>
<li>As we state in our privacy policy, AOL does store credit card
information for billing purposes, but we do not use any information
about where our members go on the Internet or the service, nor do
we share that information with any outside entities.</li>
<li>Has the new version eliminated the ability to produce plain
text emails?</li>
<li>No, our members can produce plain text email, by following
'help' instructions that show them how to do so.</li>
<li>How many in-house accessibility experts does AOL employ?</li>
<li>AOL's commitment to accessibility can be seen not just in the
creation of my own position as director of accessibility, but in
the hundreds of our employees who have been trained on numerous
aspects of accessibility and assistive technology. We have staff
who know how to build and test for accessibility across the company
including development, project management, quality assurance, and
design, to name but a few. More importantly, every new service or
product developed by AOL must now be reviewed and approved by the
the accessibility group within AOL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which consultancies and/or non-profit groups does AOL work
with?</p>
<p>We convene an accessibility advisory committee in person twice a
year and communicate via email list on a regular basis. This
committee includes experts from the American Federation for the
Blind; National Federation of the Blind; National Organization on
Disability; World Institute on Disability; Visions for Independent
Living; American Association for People with Disabilities; National
Centre for Accessible Media; Alliance for Technology Access; and
the National Association for the Deaf.</p>
<p>We also work with disability and accessibility consultants who
assist us in areas of product development and design, assistive
technology, and consumer help as well as development and/or
software licensing agreements with screen reader vendors.</p>
<p>AOL strongly believes that the Internet and the AOL service
should be friendly and easy-to-use for all customers, including
those with disabilities. That's why - starting with our beta
testing for AOL 6.0 last year - we've made a focused and concerted
effort to make sure that our products are tested and enhanced for
accessibility.</p>
<p>[Section three ends.]</p>
<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: READER RESPONSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TALKING GLUCOMETERS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COMPUTER CONNECTIONS AID DIABETICS.</strong></p>
<p>In our last issue a reader wrote in for advice from blind people
who are diabetic and use speaking blood sugar monitors, or
'glucometers', on the effectiveness of these technologies.</p>
<p>In response, Anna Dresner from the US wrote in to say that she
has had a few weeks' experience using an Accu-Chek VoiceMate
(<a href="http://www.accuchek">http://www.accuchek</a>.<br />
com/products/products/mn_voicemate_system.cfm? ), a meter
manufactured by Roche which is fitted to a voice synthesiser that
can also read certain insulin vials.</p>
<p>"I'm not using the vial reader feature, so can't speak to its
effectiveness. But the system works well, reading blood sugar
results and values stored in memory," Dresner says. "The only
problem is knowing whether you have enough blood on the strip you
use to measure the blood sugar level. The meter beeps when it
thinks there is enough, but in reality the strip can be anywhere
from half full to full, and when it isn't full, you can get some
mighty strange readings. This is a limitation of the meter itself,
not the adaptive synthesiser."</p>
<p>Another limitation of this system is that if the battery in the
meter dies, "which mine did after three weeks instead of the year
it's supposed to take," the user receives no indication ahead of
time that it is low, she says. "The meter and voice synthesiser
each have their own batteries; they're two separate units. I don't
know whether it would be possible for the synthesiser to detect
that the meter's battery is low, but it would certainly be nice if
it could.</p>
<p>"Still, the synthesiser does what it's supposed to do - it reads
the results given by the meter. If you can't see to read a standard
meter and want to be able to check your blood sugar independently,
it's worth the money."</p>
<p>Being in the US, her health insurance paid 90% of the cost of
the system, Dresner says. "I don't know much about the British
health care system, but I would definitely check to see whether
some or all of the cost could be paid through that system or an
organisation for the blind."</p>
<p>Meanwhile another reader, Martin Slack, writes in to say: "I was
diabetic on insulin when registered blind a couple of years ago and
up to that time had used an ordinary meter with a three-quarter
inch high LCD display. When I became unable to read this, I too
began to investigate speaking glucometers with the assistance of my
local diabetes nurse at Stafford District General Hospital.</p>
<p>"The hospital did in fact have a British speaking glucometer but
its technology was not very up to date as its manufacture had
ceased some years previously, and apparently the whole thing was
about the size of a shoe-box and not very user-friendly. As your
correspondent says, the US versions cost about 500 US dollars but
if one already has access to a computer with a screen reader there
is a cheaper alternative."</p>
<p>"There are on the market a small number of meters which can
transfer their readings to a computer and screen reading software
can then do the rest. Of course if you have to start by buying the
computer then it will be cheaper to go for the speaking meter but
otherwise it is simply a case of sorting through the few computer
aware meters available."</p>
<p>Diabetes UK (<a href=
"http://www.diabetes.org.uk">http://www.diabetes.org.uk</a>) has
recently reviewed glucometers in its membership periodical
'Balance', says Slack.</p>
<p>The glucometer he settled for is the Bayer Glucometer Esprit
(<a href=
"http://www.glucometer.co.uk">http://www.glucometer.co.uk</a>). As
well as its computer connection, this system features test strips
which are not the usual 'open' type but are folded in half
longitudinally so that when the end of the strip touches the drop
of blood on the finger the blood is sucked into the strip by
surface tension. "This is somewhat easier than trying to aim the
drop of blood onto the sensitive area on a normal test strip,"
Slack says. The meter can be set to beep when sufficient blood has
entered the test strip, as well as when the reading is ready about
30 seconds later.</p>
<p>"Using this approach means that it takes about five minutes to
take one reading, but on the other hand the software provides a
ready-made record of the readings with convenient graphical
displays and printouts available."</p>
<p>The software required, called WinGlucofacts, can be downloaded
from the Glucometer Esprit web site at:<br />

WinGlucofacts is free but about 5 MB in size. There is also a form
to email an order for the interconnecting cable which links the
meter to a serial port on the computer.</p>
