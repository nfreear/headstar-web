<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS FOR VISUGATE.</strong></p>
<p>VisuGate (<a href=
"http://www.nlbuk.org/common/Visugate.html">http://www.nlbuk.org/common/Visugate.html</a>),
a nascent visual impairment portal, has received 190,000 UK pounds
from the National Lottery's New Opportunities Fund putting it on
track to launch next summer.</p>
<p>The project is run by a 20-strong consortium, led by the
National Library for the Blind and including the RNIB's Research
Library; Action for Blind People; The British Journal of Visual
Impairment; the International Centre for Eye Health; the Department
of Education at University of Birmingham and BT Soundings.</p>
<p>According to project managers David Egan, recruitment was
already underway and the active development phase will begin by the
end of August this year. Testing is scheduled for next spring,
leaving a few months to make final adjustments before its summer
launch.</p>
<p><strong>CALLING ALL LANGUAGE PARTNERS.</strong></p>
<p>Following our appeal for translation partners, E-Access Bulletin
has begun to collaborate with a network of blindness institutes and
associations across Europe and the world to produce versions of the
newsletter in different languages.</p>
<p>Our first language partner, as previously announced (see
E-Access Bulletin, April 2001), is the Bologna-based Cavazza
Institute. Information on our Italian version can be found at
<a href="http://www.cavazza.it/eab">http://www.cavazza.it/eab</a>
and to subscribe to the Italian version email <a href=
"mailto:eab-it-subs@headstar.com">eab-it-subs@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Subsequently we have been able to launch Portuguese and Spanish
language versions. The Portuguese edition is being produced in
association with GESTA (<a href=
"http://www.gesta.org">http://www.gesta.org</a>), a sub-group of
the Portuguese Association of Blind and Partially Sighted (ACAPO),
with support from the Portuguese Guide Dogs Association. The
project is led by Jorge Fernandes, special access adviser to the
Portuguese government.</p>
<p>GESTA has members not only from Portugal but also from Brazil
and the wider Portuguese-speaking world. The Portuguese language
bulletin web site and archive can be found at: <a href=
"http://www.gesta.org/eaccess/eaccess.htm">http://www.gesta.org/eaccess/eaccess.htm</a>
and to subscribe to the Portuguese version email <a href=
"mailto:eab-pt-subs@headstar.com">eab-pt-subs@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Our Spanish version is produced by an Argentinian group 'Red de
Integración Especial', with input from the Spanish national
blindness institute ONCE (<a href=
"http://www.once.es">http://www.once.es</a>). The project leader in
Argentina is Graciela Caplan, professor of philosophy and
literature and Buenos Aires University, and our advisor from ONCE
is Pedro Zurita Fanjul, former Secretary General of the World Blind
Union. An archive can be found at: <a href=

<p>We are extremely grateful to all our language partners, and are
keen to hear of other potential collaborators who might be able to
produce versions in other languages. Partners are required to
translate or cover the costs of translation of the bulletin within
about a week of its appearance each month, and to maintain a simple
web page with details about that language version and a text
archive. Anyone interested should contact the editor Dan Jellinek
on <a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a></p>
<p><strong>ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW MAY EXTEND TO NET.</strong></p>
<p>UK legislation may help tackle discrimination against people
with disabilities by wen site designers, according to a paper
published this month in Warwick University Law School's Journal of
Information, Law and Technology.</p>
<p>Author Martin Sloan argues that access guidelines set by the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 could be extended to services
provided by the Internet. "It would otherwise seem anomalous to
differentiate between a customer who visits a travel agent and
another who wishes to use its online booking facility," Sloan
says.</p>
<p>He backs up his case by referring to landmark legal battles in
the US and Australia. 'Web accessibility and the DDA' can be found

<p><strong>MARGARET BENNETT LEAVES NLB</strong></p>
<p>Margaret Bennett has left her post as chief executive of the UK
National Library for the Blind this month following her appointment
as head of Lifelong Learning and Technologies Division at the
Department for Education and Skills in Sheffield.</p>
<p>Bennett had held the top job at the NLB since 1996, where she
has implemented a range of innovative projects designed to create a
flexible library combining multiple formats including Braille,
large print, digital texts and web services and focused on the
needs of all kinds of visually impaired user. Before joining the
charity she trained as an accountant and worked at West Midlands
Arts, North West Arts and Nottingham Community Housing
Association.</p>
<p>In her new post she will work on such initiatives as the
University for Industry (<a href=
"http://www.ufiltd.co.uk">http://www.ufiltd.co.uk</a>), UK Online
learning centres and projects relating to access to technology and
online learning.</p>
<p>Erstwhile NLB deputy chief executive Helen Brazier is currently
acting chief executive pending the recruitment of a permanent
replacement by the organisation's trustees.</p>
<p><strong>CORPORATE GIANTS FALL DOWN ON
ACCESSIBILITY.</strong></p>
<p>All but six of the UK's 100 largest listed companies have failed
to make adequate provision for accessible web design, according to
research by Internet developer Aspect Internet.</p>
<p>Aspect spokesperson Sarah Gooding would not reveal the full list
of results, saying: "We don't want to do a naming and shaming
exercise." But Gooding said firms covered in the survey would be
told their score if they contact Aspect (<a href=
"http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk">http://www.aspectgroup.co.uk</a>).</p>
<p>The company did, however, name the six companies which managed
to achieve the 85% pass mark: Tesco, Alliance &amp; Leicester,
Lloyds TSB, Amvescap, Royal Bank of Scotland and Vodafone.</p>
<p><strong>MAGIC 'REMEDY' TO SECTION 508.</strong></p>
<p>An imaginative solution has been found to the chaos caused by
the 'Section 508' US government technology procurement regulations
imposed on 21 June to enforce web accessibility standards: the
'Magic 508 ball'.</p>
<p>The 12-sided cardboard figure was the brainchild of Jim Tobias,
president of accessibility company Inclusive Technologies. Its
sides carry all the 508 regulations, "from 1194.21 in SubPart B to
1194.41 in SubPart D".</p>
<p>Though "pretty free of features", Tobias says it provides a
physical outlet for those forced to wrestle with the complexities
of the regulations. So far 180 people have been driven to order the
flimsy, flammable dodecahedron, although no accessible Braille
version has yet been produced.</p>

January and June issues of E-Access Bulletin. And for more about

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: APPEAL RESPONSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SUNLIGHT SENSITIVITY.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TACKLING GLARE: A SERIOUS NUISANCE</strong></p>
<p>Following last month's appeal from an E-Access Bulletin reader
for information about devices to help his young daughter who
suffers from poor vision and sunlight sensitivity, we received a
large number of extremely helpful reader responses, including links
to a number of useful web resources � thanks very much to you
all.</p>
<p>Chris McMillan, a member of the American Nystagmus mailing list,
writes in to say: "If the child has achromatopsia (total colour
blindness) then there is a self-help group right on their doorstep
in California. Frances Futterman is the lady who set it up, and one
of the things she has done is track down a complete list of types
of 'wrap round' sun specs. The Achromatopsia Network web site is
at: <a href=
"http://www.achromat.org/">http://www.achromat.org/</a></p>
<p>He also suggests Eschenbach Sunglasses which use Corning glare
control lenses (details from <a href=
"http://www.eschenbach.com/">http://www.eschenbach.com/</a> - but
see also Jen Hensil's comments below), and he says shops such as
Toys"R"us and Walmart also sell suitable sunglasses for VI
children.</p>
<p>However, Jen Hensil adds: "I would not recommend the Corning
lenses on children. Corning lenses are glass, and therefore have a
propensity to shatter. A far better option for children with light
sensitivity are NoIR sunshields from NoIR Medical Technologies.
They come in a wider variety of shades and darknesses than Corning,
are far less expensive, and safer since they are plastic.</p>
<p>"I also recommend seeing a low vision doctor for glare
evaluations."</p>
<p>Another American Nystagmus list member agrees: "NoIR sunshields
are safe and fairly sturdy and are available in a range of 'shades'
so you can get the kind that works best for your child. They are
more likely to wear them if they are comfortable with the colour
and shape of the ones they get. [My child's] are large with
wrap-around shades, meaning the shade continues onto both sides and
there is no frame outline to distract his side vision."</p>
<p>Bulletin reader Jane Fleming says: "I have cone dysplexsia, and
part of the condition means I squint in bright sunlight. Of the
prescribed sunglasses the all-round kind are the best. In the event
I purchased a pair of skiing glasses - the ones used to counteract
snow-blindness. They are simple, inexpensive and widely
available.</p>
<p>"I have also changed the background page colour of Word
documents on my computer to an off-white and I browse the Internet
with a grey background screen with light graphic. I wear sunglasses
to use the Internet and I have an anti-glare screen device."</p>
<p>David Porter writes in with a refreshingly non-technical
suggestion. "They've probably tried it, but just in case, I wonder
if a broad brimmed hat might help. I see better in bright sunlight
when I have some shade - not necessarily sunglasses."</p>
<p>John Sanders, vice president of the UK Nystagmus Network, says
our reader's daughter may have nystagmus. "There is no cure for
nystagmus, but there are a number of things which may help. For
example, his daughter would probably benefit from wrap-around
sun-glasses and a baseball cap. She may also need prescription
glasses to correct myopia which she may have as well - ideally, she
will already have prescription glasses if she needs them, but sadly
we find that isn't always the case or that the prescription is
wrong."</p>
<p>The Nystagmus Network has a web site at: <a href=
"http://www.btinternet.com/~lynest/nystag01.htm">http://www.btinternet.com/~lynest/nystag01.htm</a></p>
<p>Sue Allard writes in to say she has Retinitis Pigmentosa and
suffers badly with glare problems. "All sunglasses - whatever
colour - block too much light and so my vision is depleted even
more. I'm not sure which is worse, the glare or the 'cure'!</p>
<p>"However, I have finally found some lenses that really do help.
They have been tested out and are recommended by the British
Retinitis Pigmentosa Society (<a href=
"http://www.brps.demon.co.uk">http://www.brps.demon.co.uk</a>).
They are 'Blue-Bloc' lenses, which, as the name suggests, block out
only the blue, problem-causing wavelengths. For more information
email Ian Pyzer at Medi-View on <a href=
"mailto:eyepyzer@aol.com">eyepyzer@aol.com</a></p>
<p>"Glare does seem to be a major problem in most eye conditions.
It seems, from my experience with Gloucestershire County
Association for the Blind that many sighted people do not realise
or understand what a difference can be made for someone with even
very little sight, if glare can be managed.</p>
<p>"I have had some dealings with people producing signs and it has
been extremely difficult to persuade them that white shiny surfaces
with black writing is not the way to go! I would be very interested
to hear from others with glare problems to hear how it affects them
and how they deal with it." Responses to this new appeal are

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: READER RESPONSE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UNIVERSAL ACCESS.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="section-1." id="section-1.">* In an article in last
month's bulletin, 'Commercial sector must be</a></h1>
driven to build in accessibility', Kevin Carey argued it would be
preferable for major software developers to build accessibility
features into their products rather than people having to rely on
niche-market accessibility suppliers.
<p>For all its strengths, Carey said, the specialist accessibility
marketplace is fragile and ramshackle and ultimately investment and
reliability are more important than improvisation and enthusiasm.
He concluded that if current disability law was inadequate to force
suppliers to make their products accessible then the law must be
beefed up.</p>
<p>One reader at least, Matt King, begged to differ: below, we
publish his response. If anyone would like to continue the debate
please email the editor Dan Jellinek on <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a></p>
<p><strong>CO-OPERATION IS KEY</strong><br />
By Matt King <a href=
"mailto:mattking@us.ibm.com">mattking@us.ibm.com</a></p>
<p>In the first place, I can't imagine that either of the two
practical examples in Kevin Carey's article - failure to add a
Braille display to an access package producing speech and failure
to make a new laptop accessible as it ran a new operating system
incompatible with earlier access software - would be any better
served in the future he suggests.</p>
<p>Does he know how companies the size of Microsoft work? When was
the last time you were able to get an issue with a 'niche' feature
of an MS product (or the product of any other major computer
sofware developer) resolved any faster or cheaper than you could
with GW Micro or Freedom Scientific?</p>
<p>Second, does he realise how large companies respond to
legislated solutions? Remember that in the environment he is
suggesting that the large software developers will not have any
revenue streams that are dependent on the quality of the access
solution built-in to their products.</p>
<p>With excruciating difficulty, someone may be able to develop
some local legislation in the UK or somewhere else to legislate for
some minimal level of quality. Besides being expensive to enforce,
keeping the legislation current would be nearly impossible. That
would surely slow down progress toward more advanced and truly
universal design.</p>
<p>Third, do sighted users have a different way to read a line,
word, or character in every software package? Imagine having to
learn how to do these things with each different commercial
vendors' products. And don't think you would even have consistency
among products offered by the same company. Or is he suggesting a
100,000-page piece of legislation that would become obsolete every
few years as it intimately details how every access operation
should be implemented?</p>
<p>Finally, if we are making this request for one disability,
shouldn't we make it for all? And, what is the definition of all?
Where do you stop? How small of a niche do we force companies to
serve? Do we stop at disabling conditions experienced by x% of the
population or less? What would 'x' be?</p>
<p>I would encourage everyone to think in terms of how we can
leverage the marketplace and technology to work in our favour. For
instance, there is a huge lack of standards in the accessibility
industry. Instead of working with disconnected and relatively
ineffective legislative bodies around the world, what about putting
the same amount of energy toward developing standards for
compatibility and communications between assistive technologies and
general purpose software?</p>
<p>There are excellent forums for doing this in the various IT and
electronics industry standards bodies. I think the IT industry is
ready and willing to co-operate.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: PROFILE.</strong><br />
<strong>-VIRTUAL VERSE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHARLES BENNETT: PORTRAIT OF AN ONLINE ARTIST.</strong>
By Tamara Fletcher <a href=
"mailto:tamara@headstar.com">tamara@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>"Messages travelling on bursts of electricity � like thought.
Each of us thinking and all the wires lit up with our words. I'm 47
and married and didn't want to tell my story the usual way. I was
born".</p>
<p>Thus writes Charles Bennett in a poetic biography written for
the National Library for the Blind on his appointment this month as
the organisation's fifth 'virtual writer in residence'.</p>
<p>Following Matthew Sweeney, Susan Everett, Jean Sprackland and
Syed Manzurul Islam into this position, he will take up 'residence'
on the library's web site (<a href=
"http://www.nlbuk.org">http://www.nlbuk.org</a>) as part of its
interactive 'Read On' programme for blind book-lovers. The scheme
has funding from the National Lottery.</p>
<p>Bennett has a love of all things creative, especially poetry,
for which he credits his English teacher. School was not an
otherwise pleasant experience for him as he endured bullying. "It
was a glimmer of light in a dark forest � I guess I must have been
about 14 but I think you continue to discover poetry throughout
your whole life," he says.</p>
<p>Leaving school at the age of 16, he worked in industry for 14
years before enrolling at University to study drama and theatre
studies at the age of 30, where he graduated and went on to teach
English.</p>
<p>He gave up his teaching career as he wanted to concentrate on
poetry and became 'Reader in Residence' in Blackpool, with a remit
to foster an interest in reading in the area. He developed a number
of projects including the Blackpool Beach Library.</p>
<p>"I ran the smallest mobile library in the world � I ran books in
a wheelbarrow up and down Blackpool Prom and delivered books to
your deckchair," says Bennett.</p>
<p>In January 2000 he was appointed as Literature Development
Facilitator at Staffordshire County Council where he worked with
librarians and the public to promote literature. One of the schemes
he was involved in there centred around live poetry readings in
estate agents and the estate agents themselves would write their
own poetry as part of the 'Poetry Places' scheme funded by the
Poetry Society.</p>
<p>Bennett became interested in the possibility of using computers
for his work when he visited Smith College in the US back in autumn
1986. He found what he describes as an "electronic treasure trove"
where the students taught him to translate his work from paper to
screen.</p>
<p>"One of the benefits of using a computer for a poet is that you
can manipulate type written text more easily. It benefits the
visually impaired or blind as they can access a great deal of
information without having to leave home."</p>
<p>As Virtual Poet in Residence at the NLB his role will be "to
stimulate an interest in poetry, literature and life," and to
stimulate an interest in individual creativity and contemporary
poetry.</p>
<p>The full requirements of his role are still being firmed up but
it is likely that he will be responsible for choosing a book each
month and entering into dialogue with readers via the web as well
as having audio files of his readings to download from the site. He
will also encourage the writing of poetry by visitors.</p>
<p>"I am happy to talk about bananas and chickpeas, cricket or
poetry; to engage in debate; or to provide an insight into the
world and extrasensory ability. The visually impaired and blind
have a special way of interacting, almost extrasensory. I think
disability is the wrong word as it's like an extra ability," he
says.</p>
<p>One of the major disadvantages to blind people he cites as "not
being able to access contemporary texts so it's more difficult to
be as widely read. My guess is that there are advantages as those
with visual impairment tend to be more responsive to cadence and
nuance. Seeing can be a visual noise which stops you
concentrating."</p>
<p>As manager of the Ledbury Poetry Festival (<a href=
"http://www.poetryfestival">http://www.poetryfestival</a>. com) he
says he would also like to think about developing some projects
aimed at accessible poetry for the blind for next year's event.</p>
<p>This year's festival has just taken place, and Bennett is
currently recovering from something of a "poetry hangover". So the
virtual residency will be the hair of the dog � and E-Access
Bulletin readers are urged to visit his web page at <a href=

and help him recover.</p>
