<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE -
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* MOBILE INDUSTRY CONVENES
ACCESS GROUP.</a></h1>
<p>The first ever pan-industry mobile phone accessibility working
group is to hold its inaugural meeting in January, E-Access
Bulletin has learned.</p>
<p>The group is to be hosted by Vodafone, with its initial members
to be all the mobile phone operators with a UK presence, namely BT
Cellnet, One2One, Orange and Vodafone. Subsequently mobile network
operators from other countries will be invited to join, along with
handset manufacturers, to create a global organisation.</p>
<p>Mike Duxbury, disability access manager at Vodafone and the
driving force behind the project, says the group will take a
concerted but realistic look at "what we can do, not just what
people want us to do" in making mobile phone networks and handsets
more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>This tone of realism was echoed by Nancy Valley, special markets
and accessible products manager with mobile handset manufacturer
Motorola, when she addressed last month's RNIB Techshare
conference.</p>
<p>"Motorola is unlikely to reach a stage where it can guarantee
that all products will be accessible for everyone," Valley said.
"We can't can't pack everything into a product at a price people
can afford. So we look to create a range of products."</p>
<p>Accessible features already built into some handsets include
'voice notes', whereby the user can record brief memos or
instructions; text that can be magnified; and voice activation for
number dialling, though some of these features are only available
in the US. Fully voice-controlled menus "are coming", she said,
although she could only promise this feature "within a couple of
years".</p>
<p>Duxbury said Vodafone is also working on full text-to-speech
services, including for SMS text messaging, but he could not offer
a firm delivery date either. He said that to offer SMS-to-speech,
compatibility issues would first have to be resolved between the
four UK mobile operators.</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* FUNDING FOR ONLINE
LEARNING CENTRE.</a></h1>
<p>The National Library for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.nlbuk.org">http://www.nlbuk.org</a>) has gained 120,000
pounds of funding from the PPP Healthcare Medical Trust (<a href=
"http://www.ppptrust.org">http://www.ppptrust.org</a>), to create a
new centre for online learning resources for the blind and visually
impaired.</p>
<p>VILC � the Visual Impairment Learning Centre - will create and
pilot web-based educational resources, working in conjunction with
the RNIB, education portal Digital Brain (<a href=
"http://www.digitalbrain.com">http://www.digitalbrain.com</a>) and
VICTAR, the Visual Impairment Centre for Teaching and Research at
the University of Birmingham<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.education.bham.ac.uk/research/victar">http://www.education.bham.ac.uk/research/victar</a>).</p>
<p>The project will begin a research phase from May to summer 2002
and develop the first pilot resources by the middle of 2003.</p>
<p>VILC is one of two spin-off projects that have arisen from work
by the NLB on a planned single web gateway to visual impairment
resources, 'Visugate'. A second spin-off project, the Visual
Impairment Library of Research (VILOR), was announced last month as
a first point of access for anyone with an interest in visual
impairment research. The project will aim to construct a research
'map' which is customisable to each user's field of interest.</p>
<p>Visugate itself is set to undergo testing in Spring next year
ahead of a planned launch date in September. The gateway will
initially carry brief descriptions and links to around 1,500
quality-controlled online documents and resources held by the
project's 21 partners including the RNIB's Research Library; Action
for Blind People; The British Journal of Visual Impairment; and the
International Centre for Eye Health.</p>
<p>For more information see <a href=

<p>NOTE: The project will eventually operate from an accessible
site at <a href=

not yet live.</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* SUPPORT PROMISED FOR
LERNOUT &amp; HAUSPIE USERS.</a></h1>
<p>Users of speech and language software developed by the now
bankrupt Belgian technology giant Lernout &amp; Hauspie are to
receive ongoing product support, according to Scansoft (<a href=
"http://www.scansoft.com">http://www.scansoft.com</a>), the US
company which bought the assets at auction earlier this month.</p>
<p>The scanning software company told E-Access Bulletin this week
that support will be provided by business development firm
MediaGold (<a href=
"http://www.mediagold.com">http://www.mediagold.com</a>) in
accordance with an arrangement negotiated before the software
sale.</p>
<p>The future of the products is less certain, with Scansoft's
European marketing director Mark Erwich unable to rule out the
discontinuation of one or more of them. Another Scansoft
representative said: "Currently, there are no plans in place to
integrate the respective technologies. However, we will continue to
look at possibilities where they can either be merged or used
together."</p>
<p>The three main access products bought by Scansoft are Dragon
Naturally Speaking and Voice Xpress voice recognition software, and
the Realspeak speech-synthesiser. Lernout &amp; Hauspie's erstwhile
Kurzweil range of scan-and-read software did not form part of the
Scansoft deal, having been bought out in mid-November by managers
who now trade as Kurzweil Educational Systems (<a href=
"http://www.kurzweiledu.com">http://www.kurzweiledu.com</a>). Among
the directors is access technology trailblazer Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>Lernout &amp; Hauspie, once considered to be a high-flying
European hitech business, was pronounced bankrupt in November 2000
by a Belgian court following the discovery of accounting
irregularities in its Korean operations. In May this year the
company's founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie were detained in jail
as part of an ongoing investigation into fraud and share price
manipulation.</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* CAST BREAKS FREE
MOULD.</a></h1>
<p>CAST, a US not-for-profit organisation promoting technology for
all, has begun charging for downloads of its new website
accessibility-checker, Bobby Worldwide.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the internationally-renowned Bobby system
were supported by donations from major corporations and downloads
were offered free at the CAST Web site (<a href=
"http://www.cast.org">http://www.cast.org</a>), where it remains
free to check single pages.</p>
<p>Bobby Worldwide costs 99 dollars a user, or 3,000 dollars a
server, with a discounted rate of 2,000 dollars a server for ten or
more servers. Companies wishing to associate themselves explicitly
with the Bobby campaign in promotional literature can still do so,
at a price: 5,000 dollars for a 'Booster' sponsorship package or
10,000 for a 'Booster Premium' package.</p>
<p>"Revenue from the sale of Bobby Worldwide funds ongoing
development, infrastructure, administrative, and support costs,"
according to the CAST web site. Bobby Worldwide's main advance on
previous versions is that it is equipped to test sites against US
'Section 508' legislation which requires US government sites to be
accessible to all.</p>
<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* BOOK 'FORAGER' SERVICE
LAUNCHED.</a></h1>
<p>An online service for blind and visually impaired people
simulating the process of browsing through books in a library has
been launched by the National Library for the Blind.</p>
<p>The NLB Book Forager is an accessible version of a system
developed by Applied Psychology Research (<a href=
"http://www.youmeus.com">http://www.youmeus.com</a>) on behalf of
'Branching Out' (<a href=
"http://www.branching-out.net">http://www.branching-out.net</a>), a
project run by the Society of Chief Librarians in England and
Wales.</p>
<p>The NLB says the project is unusual in that it represents one of
the few occasions when a technology has been made available to
blind people at the same time as sighted people, and accessibility
has been built up from the start.</p>
<p>A series of drop-down menus allows users to specify the level of
11 different qualities they would like a book to have, ranging from
the amount of sex and violence to how optimistic or realistic it
should be. They can also specify the age, gender and sexual
orientation of the main character.</p>
<p>So far, the Forager software only handles 1,000 works of fiction
published since 1998, which are all held in grade II Braille format
by the NLB. Once a set of characteristics has been selected the
software returns a list of appropriate titles, and users can order
them by email.</p>
<p>For visually impaired people, choosing books in the past has
often meant reading synopses that give the plot away, and the need
to consult with others may have led to more conservative choices.
The new system aims to change that, although its creators admit it
works best for extreme choices, and does not always work that well
if too many different characteristics are specified together.</p>
<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">* BACK TO
BASICS.</a></h1>
<p>Access software tutorial writer John Wilson has produced a
recorded guide to the fundamentals of Windows-based computing,
'VIPs introduction to computers'.</p>
<p>The two audio cassettes, which costs 12 pounds including
postage, are designed to offer the information needed by those new
to computing or just to Windows in making a decision on whether or
not to buy a new computer system.</p>
<p>Just under a third of the three-hour guide is taken up with an
introduction to the different types of computers and peripherals,

<h1><a name="section-20." id="section-20.">* THE DAY OF THE
GNU.</a></h1>
by Dan Jellinek <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a>
<p>The use of free software like the Linux operating system is not
widespread by visually impaired people, partly due to a general
focus of access technology development on Microsoft Windows. But
this could soon be set to change, with growing realisation of the
high accessibility, affordability and flexibility of free
software.</p>
<p>Many people equate free software with open source software, but
not all open source software is 'free', as defined by Richard
Stallman's Free Software Foundation (<a href=
"http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</a>).</p>
<p>Stallman is also the developer of GNU, a free operating system
which was combined with a core or 'kernel' called Linux to form
GNU/Linux (commonly referred to simply as Linux).</p>
<p>The free software definition (<a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freesw">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freesw</a>.
html) which applies to software developed under the 'GNU General
Public License' (and protected by a legally binding system called
'copyleft', a sort of anti-copyright) is emphatically about much
more than cost: 'free as in freedom' is the preferred mantra.
Indeed, free software can be sold, if people can find ways of
adding value for example through writing manuals.</p>
<p>The definition has four main elements: the freedom to run the
program, for any purpose (freedom 0); the freedom to study how the
program works, and adapt it (freedom 1); the freedom to
redistribute copies (freedom 2); and the freedom to improve the
program, and release your improvements to the public (freedom 3).
Access to software source code � 'open source' - is a precondition
for freedoms 1 and 3.</p>
<p>At the RNIB's recent 'Techshare 2001' conference (<a href=
"http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare">http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare</a>)
Janina Sajka, director of technology research and development at
the American Foundation for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.afb.org">http://www.afb.org</a>), said the active free
software development community now numbers some 300,000 people
worldwide.</p>
<p>"Free software has really taken off in the last year or so,
including in the corporate world � IBM is spending a million
dollars on Linux development," Sajka said. "It is often of
outstanding quality."</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways for screen reader users to gain an idea
of GNU/Linux is a free package called Speakup (<a href=
"http://www.linuxspeakup">http://www.linuxspeakup</a>. org), she
said, which works with Linux to read all the screens and messages
aloud. It has not yet been accepted into the Linux 'kernel' as a
default standard, but there are three versions of Linux that do
come ready packaged with Speakup - Debian (<a href=
"http://www.debian.org">http://www.debian.org</a>), Red Hat
(<a href="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</a>) and
Slackware (<a href=
"http://www.slackware.com">http://www.slackware.com</a>).</p>
<p>"With Speakup, a blind person or a deafblind person using
Braille TTY [teletypewriter] output can install and configure a
computer operating system from scratch for the first time," Sajka
said.</p>
<p>Once Linux is installed, there is free software available to
allow the user to carry out the whole range of tasks available to
the Windows user, she said. Content is generally first keyed into a
raw text editor and then formatted subsequently for output as a
word processor document, web page or whatever, a system which
boosts accessibility.</p>
<p>There is a free software equivalent to the Microsoft Office
suite of desktop software packages, 'OpenOffice' (<a href=
"http://www.openoffice.org">http://www.openoffice.org</a>), a form
of which runs on 'GNOME' (<a href=
"http://www.gnome.org">http://www.gnome.org</a>), one of the major
graphical interfaces for Linux. Both GNOME and OpenOffice have been
developed by Sun Microsystems in an attempt to break Microsoft's
hold on the desktop market.</p>
<p>As a point-and-click graphical environment like Windows, GNOME
is not as accessible as the basic 'command line' form of Linux, but
Sajka said Sun has recognised that it has to be made accessible,
not least because under US law software must be accessible if it is
to compete for federal contracts.</p>
<p>In November the 'Gnopernicus' project, led by German firm BAUM
(<a href="http://www.baum.de">http://www.baum.de</a>), was
announced to develop combined screen magnification and screen
reader features for GNOME (<a href=
"http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/AT/Gnopernicus">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/AT/Gnopernicus</a>).</p>
<p>In Europe, another graphical interface for Linux is more
commonly used � KDE (<a href=
"http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</a>). This too has an
accessibility project underway, although it is not as far down the
line as the work for GNOME, Sajka said.</p>
<p>Beyond the usual desktop applications, Linux also shines in the
field of internet and other communications, she said � "AT&amp;T
use it to run the world's telephone systems."</p>
<p>The accessibility of the command line system means that Linux is
certainly the system of choice for blind computer programmers, she
said, and indeed there are many blind programmers working in this
field. But should the ordinary blind or visually impaired computer
user use Linux?</p>
<p>"The answer today is � perhaps", Sajka said. "Anyone who used to
like DOS will like Linux � it is very accessible. You can listen to
an audio file or browse the web from a text command line, not a
graphical interface. It's also very stable � it's nice to compute
all day and go away and come back and never have to reboot. There
is also increased flexibility � you take what you like and leave
the rest.</p>
<p>"I think that if assistive technology were invented today, it
would look only at Linux. This did not happen because when
assistive technology began to be developed, UNIX [the forerunner to
Linux] was not free, and Windows became universally used in
business."</p>
<p>Momentum does appear to be building up behind Linux in the
access community. Soon the DAISY digital book standard will be made
compatible with Linux, and next year for the first time there will
be a Linux accessibility track (co-ordinated by Sun) at the annual
conference on 'Technologies and persons with disabilities' at
California State University Northridge, CSUN (<a href=
"http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2002">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf2002</a>).</p>
<p>Ultimately however, the really compelling reason why free
software could be the future for the accessibility community is one
of independence, she said. "With free software, lobbying the IT
giants to make their products accessible becomes irrelevant. We
don't need advocates, we need engineers."</p>
<p>NOTE: For further information on Linux and accessibility, see
the documents section of programmer Saqib Shaikh's web site, which
includes the 'Blinux Software Map', a superb overview of assistive
software available:<br />

<p>Computer games and educational programs can provide a compelling
way for children to learn how to interact with computers. But as
most children's software requires sight, blind or visually impaired
children can be placed at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>"The problem is that most so-called text within children's
software is not really text at all, but pictures of letters -
bitmapped text - and is very difficult to convert to real text,"
says children's software developer Ronald Cooper. To make matters
worse, even when text is not presented as an image, there is a
dearth of screen-reading software suitable for children. To
overcome this, Cooper's company RJ Cooper &amp; Associates
(<a href="http://www.rjcooper.com">http://www.rjcooper.com</a>) is
developing a screen reader for children, 'KeyRead'.</p>
<p>The development process for this software has involved visiting
disabled children in different parts of the US. The upshot of one
of these visits was a piece of software called 'Find the Buttons',
which teaches blind children about the concept of a graphical user
interface using a mouse.</p>
<p>As the child moves the mouse around across different sized
panels on the screen, different sounds are heard depending on
whether the mouse pointer is inside or outside a panel. Entering
the various panels and clicking leads to stories or games being
run. A downloadable version of the software, which was developed in
association with a toddler from New Jersey called Jimmy, can be
found at: <a href=
"http://www.rjcooper.com/find-the-buttons">http://www.rjcooper.com/find-the-buttons</a></p>
<p>Though unusual, Cooper's products are not the only ones to
address the needs of the visually impaired child.</p>

manufactures pre-reading software such as the 'concept keyboard',
where different keys make different sounds when they are pressed.
The company also produces software and equipment such as accessible
switches that are helpful aids for preschool children using
computers.</p>
<p>The Northern Grid for Learning (<a href=
"http://www.northerngrid.org">http://www.northerngrid.org</a>), a
consortium of education authorities in the north of England, has
recently produced a free piece of educational developmental
software suitable for children from toddlers to young adults to
help parents and teachers to assess which visual imagery is most
stimulating for them. Called the SENSwitcher, the software selects
combinations of contrasting colours and shapes and records the
child's responses. Through interaction it aims to provide an
enjoyable way for children to learn cause and effect.</p>
<p>Recently, the world-renowned Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Media Lab has entered the field too, with a
prototype sophisticated technological toy called the 'Bricket'
(<a href=
"http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/bricket">http://llk.media.mit.edu/projects/bricket</a>),
a sort of intelligent building block that has sensors and can emit
sounds. At the heart of each block is a small, programmable
microcomputer onto which programs written on a computer using
screen-reading software and the simple LOGO programming language
can be downloaded. The Bricket can then control and interact with a
large variety of sensors, for example playing a song when someone
walks though a door.</p>
<p>The Bricket is not exclusively designed for children, although
MIT scientists have already found that bricks with brains can
assist visually impaired children play, develop and learn with
computer enhanced Lego: <a href=
"http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/legologo">http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/legologo</a></p>
<p>MIT graduate student Rahul Bhargava hopes the Bricket will
become useful as a learning tool: "The experience of building
computational constructions is rich in small challenges that
require hard thinking to overcome. The idea of computation should
by no means be limited to the computer and its screen interface. I
hope to adapt this technology to provide the blind and visually
impaired with a new way of understanding the power of
computation."</p>

<p>The idea of using a computer to play games dates back to the
1980s, when adventure games were popular. Because these games were
textbased, blind people were able to play, but as computers
developed companies began increasingly to produce games relying on
visuals.</p>
<p>This trend meant that until a few years ago, text-based
adventure games remained almost the only games playable by a blind
person. To this day there is still a small, but active community of
text-based games enthusiasts, both archiving old and developing new
adventures. Two of the biggest collections of these can be found at
<a href=

<a href=

<p>In the late 1990s a New Jersey based company called Personal
Computer Systems (PCS <a href=
"http://www.pcsgames.com">http://www.pcsgames.com</a>) began to
break the mould with the launch of a range of sound- and text-
driven games running on the DOS operating system. The games ranged
from card and board games to sports and action games, including a
car racing game.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, blind people, along with most other
people, began to migrate to Windows. PCS met this growing market by
converting their games to Windows and recording sound files to
replace the textual information that had previously been read out
by a DOS screen reader.</p>
<p>These games were still relatively static and crude compared to
their mainstream counterparts, but over the past year or two there
have been further major advances.</p>
<p>The first attempt at making more exciting games for Windows was
by gamesfortheblind.com (<a href=
"http://www.gamesfortheblind.com">http://www.gamesfortheblind.com</a>).
This company produced a variety of games, including card games,
educational games and a version of Battleships. Originally the
programs were written to interface with the JAWS screen-reader, but
more recent versions also work with WindowEyes, and the company is
now working on producing self-voicing versions that use the
Eloquence software synthesiser. Gamesfortheblind.com also produced
the first accessible game that can be played over the Internet,
StarFight (<a href=
"http://www.gamesfortheblind.com/aig/star.html">http://www.gamesfortheblind.com/aig/star.html</a>).
This is a version of Battleships using spaceships rather than
boats. Users log onto a chat server and find an opponent to play
remotely.</p>
<p>Last year computer-based entertainment was revolutionised with
the launch of a Wild West game called Grizzly Gulch from Bavisoft
(<a href="http://www.bavisoft.com">http://www.bavisoft.com</a>). It
is self-voicing, and uses stereo sound clips to produce a life-like
atmosphere. Your mission is to prevent a crime to impress the
sheriff, after which the sheriff will send you on bounty
missions.</p>
<p>Throughout the game your main task is to fight off baddies by
engaging in gun-fights. You will hear them taunting you from
different directions, and you must turn to shoot them. In some
scenes you will also hear frightened bystanders, who you must try
not to shoot.</p>
<p>There is also a casino, where you can play games such as slot
machines, Poker, Blackjack or the shell game, where there are three
shells, with a coin hidden under one. One of the outer shells is
swapped with the central shells repeatedly, and at the end you must
guess where the coin is. This is represented by hearing a sound
playing to the left when the left shell is exchanged and a noise to
the right when the right shell is exchanged. You must concentrate
hard and follow the exchange.</p>
<p>Another company which has recently entered the blind gaming
arena is GMA Games (<a href=
"http://www.gmagames.com">http://www.gmagames.com</a>), with Lone
Wolf and Trek 2000. The former is a World War II game in which you
pilot a submarine by listening to the sound of the motors and
sensors. One particularly nice feature of this game is that as well
as being able to play predefined missions, players can create their
own missions, and a few player-defined missions are included on the
GMA web site. Trek 2000 is based on Star Trek, and again play is
accomplished through sound effects and signals from sensors.</p>
<p>GMA recently released a third game which many, including myself,
believe is the best accessible game released to date - Shades Of
Doom, an audio version of the popular Doom game (for a full
description of this game see 'Biological warfare', section five,
E-Access Bulletin November 2001).</p>
<p>Another company producing games for the blind is ESP Softworks
(<a href=
"http://www.espsoftworks.com">http://www.espsoftworks.com</a>).
They recently released their first game, ESP Pinball. This game is
based on the classic pinball table, with each level having a new
theme, such as Pacman or soccer. As you play you can hear the ball
rolling around from the left to the right. Different sound effects
are used to symbolise different events. For example, in the Pacman
table there are different sounds to signal that food has appeared
or is being eaten, or to indicate the position of ghosts.</p>
<p>You knock the ball up the table by flipping the paddles. Every
so often the ball will stop rolling - maybe when it is caught
against a bumper - and then a scan will start. You will hear a
beeping while the board is scanned from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock and
round. During the scanning you will hear the sounds for objects
found, at which point you can hit the paddle and send the ball
rolling off again. Beware, however, that if a ghost is hiding
behind something it won't be picked up during the scan!</p>
<p>ESP also has a demo of their second game on their site, which is
soon to be released: Monkey Business, an arcade style game. Plans
for a teleportation device have been stolen from your boss by
undercover monkeys controlled by the evil Dr Wobble. On each level
you must catch all the monkeys and retrieve the pages of the plan,
assisted by a coordinate reader and object detector.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two more companies which have made an entry
into the blind gaming arena. Educational software company MindsEye2
(<a href="http://www.mindseye2.com">http://www.mindseye2.com</a>)
has released a children's audio crossword puzzle. And second, there
is Zform (<a href="http://www.zform.com">http://www.zform.com</a>),
a non-profit organisation that aims to produce games that can be
enjoyed by both blind and sighted gamers alike. They have not yet
started development on their first game, a medieval chess game with
audio effects that can be played over the Internet, but estimate it
should take around a year to develop.</p>
<p>With the long-awaited release of a second title from Bavisoft
also due out early in the New Year � this time based in a haunted
village � and a new car-racing game due out from ESP, it seems
blind computer gaming is finally coming of age.</p>
