<p><strong>SECTION ONE - NEWS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TESCO SITE BAGS NEW RNIB</strong><br />
<strong>AWARD.</strong></p>
<p>The supermarket chain Tesco has<br />
picked-up a newly-created RNIB 'See It Right' award for 'Tesco
Access', an<br />
accessible site for ordering groceries launched this week<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.tesco.com/access">http://www.tesco.com/access</a>).</p>
<p>The supermarket plans to back up the<br />
site by training staff and giving them more time to unpack and
describe goods for visually impaired customers.</p>
<p>Tesco has not always been strong on<br />
accessibility: last year the RNIB lent its voice to a campaign
urging the company to offer an accessible version of its web site.
Once Tesco had decided to heed<br />
protesters' calls, the site took around six months to develop.</p>
<p>Among Tesco's competitors, Asda told<br />
E-Access Bulletin it has no plans to<br />
create an accessible version of its web site. Sainsbury's online
shopping site is frames-based, making it difficult to use with
screen reading software.</p>
<p>According to the RNIB the See It Right award will be given to
both commercial and none commercial web sites as and<br />
when they are found to meet RNIB<br />
access standards.</p>
<p><strong>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS?</strong></p>
<p>Polls Apart 3, a campaign to highlight disabled peoples' right
to vote, is<br />
inviting people to send in their<br />
assessment of the accessibility of their local polling office
through its new web site (<a href=
"http://www.pa3.org.uk">http://www.pa3.org.uk</a>).</p>
<p>The campaign has been launched by the<br />
disability charity Scope with support<br />
from the Disability Rights Commission. The web site will be used to
publish realtime findings from each constituency as<br />
they come in on Election Day, June 7.</p>
<p>The campaigners hope the convenience<br />
of the online survey will mean more<br />
people participate than in two previous paper-only surveys. On and
offline<br />
responses are expected from two thirds of UK election
constituencies.</p>
<p>Scope plans to go on to use the results to name and shame
councils that fail to<br />
make adequate provision for accessible voting. The charity is an
advocate of<br />
pilot schemes to improve the lot of<br />
disabled voters, including trial of<br />
electronic voting techniques.</p>
<p>In the 1997 General Election, some 94% of disabled people
surveyed encountered one or more barriers that could have<br />
prevented them from being able to cast their vote. On average there
are 13,000 disabled people in each UK<br />
constituency.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNET ACCESS EXPERIENCES</strong><br />
<strong>WANTED!</strong></p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin is planning a series of articles investigating
the practical<br />
problems faced by visually impaired<br />
people seeking Internet access for the first time. We will
concentrate on four issues: cost; sources of financial<br />
assistance; specialist training; and<br />
providers of technical support.</p>
<p>To anchor this research in people's real experiences we would be
extremely<br />
grateful for readers' input. So, please, email your experiences,

<p><strong>PHYSICS VIA SCREEN READERS</strong><br />
<strong>AND RUBBER BANDS.</strong></p>
<p>The latest in John M Williams' regular assistive technology
columns in the<br />
Internet magazine BusinessWeek Online<br />
offers a fascinating insight into the work of one of the world's
leading blind<br />
physicists, Kent Cullers.</p>
<p>Cullers, senior researcher at the Search for Extra Terrestrial
Intelligence (SETI) Institute in California, uses both new and old
technologies to help him in his work, ranging from raised-line

courses.</p>
<p>Around 600 courses are being offered<br />
for free to access testers for 60 days, including ones in
computing, business<br />
and personal skills. Duncans' courses<br />
generally cost between 69 and 149<br />
Canadian dollars a year.</p>

<p><strong>RADIO LISTENERS GROUP -</strong><br />
<strong>UPDATE.</strong></p>
<p>In our last issue (April 2001) we<br />
featured a piece about a radio listeners' email group started by
Visually Impaired Radio and Electronics Society (VIRES).</p>
<p>The piece suggested that the online<br />
community was dedicated to reminiscing about bygone radio
programmes, but our source Clive Lever � a VIRES<br />
subscriber - points out it is far more dynamic than that, and
covers all radiorelated topics including the latest<br />
programmes.</p>
<p>Lever says examples of typical<br />
discussions cover "which satellite<br />
stations are about to change frequency, who's about to be awarded
franchises for new stations and what special features stations like
Radio 4 are running."</p>

<p><strong>SECTION TWO: PROFILE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cearbhall O'Meadhra</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IRISH EQUALITY COMMISSIONER</strong><br />
<strong>COMES THROUGH THE HARD</strong><br />
<strong>WAY.</strong></p>
<p>Cearbhall O'Meadhra, the first ever blind person to be appointed
to the Equality Authority of Ireland<br />
(<a href="http://www.equality.ie">http://www.equality.ie</a>), has
come<br />
through the hard way to emerge a strong champion of the rights of
the visually impaired to access technology.</p>
<p>O'Meadhra is completely blind. He was<br />
diagnosed at the age of four with retinitis pigmentosa - a
progressive genetic eye condition that affects the retina. He<br />
started to experience the effects in 1970 when blindness affected
his lower field of vision and he became completely<br />
night blind.</p>
<p>He qualified as an architect in 1969 and was a specialist in
archaeological<br />
surveying techniques. Occasionally his job would require him to
work at night which became increasingly difficult - he was often
only able to hear the voices of his fellow colleagues. Eventually
the<br />
difficulties led him to give up<br />
architecture and follow his love of<br />
flamenco and qualify as a music teacher in Spain.</p>
<p>In 1978, his failing vision caused him to fall down a flight of
stairs and badly injure himself. He returned to Ireland and
couldn't get work so embarked on a course teaching English as a
foreign<br />
language and taught in Dublin for three years. His first experience
of<br />
discrimination ended his employment -<br />
the school received a complaint from an Italian agency that the
students were<br />
caused distress being taught by a blind teacher so he returned
again to music<br />
and set up a music school.</p>
<p>"I hadn't completely lost my sight but I couldn't see books so I
learned to make music programs and spent a year<br />
devising a complex 'note speller'<br />
program to help familiarise students with a keyboard."</p>
<p>This was the beginning of his ongoing<br />
relationship with computers and led him to apply for a post at the
Bank of Ireland in 1983. The bank accepted his<br />
application on condition that he<br />
completed a rigorous RNIB<br />
programming training course, funded by the national Rehabilitation
Board in<br />
Ireland.</p>
<p>"My Braille and typing were too slow - there were no computer
screens or<br />
terminals so we had to code on typing<br />
paper which we couldn't see and if we<br />
made one small error in the code the<br />
program wouldn't work," says<br />
O'Meadhra. "There were no sighted<br />
people to help proof-read our work.<br />
There was no system for recording<br />
computer code in Braille so we had to<br />
set it up ourselves - we were dictated code and we tapped it out in
Braille. It was a 12 week course with strict<br />
deadlines - and boy did my typing skills improve!"</p>
<p>He is scathing about the standard of<br />
sophisticated computing help available from charitable sources.
"There is a<br />
horrible charitable attitude of lie down, submit, accept your fate.
I've been active in the disability field for 16 years and witnessed
thousands of people going<br />
through courses but they are not coming out with computer skills. I
know six<br />
disabled people who are working.</p>
<p>"There were no courses in the<br />
commercial sector to explain to blind<br />
people how things work, so I was stuck at the bottom. They don't
expect blind people to be in the workplace."</p>
<p>Initially employed at the bank as a<br />
component programmer, O'Meadhra<br />
soon found his phone became an<br />
informal 'help line' for people requiring information about
accessible technology. The bank was accommodating and<br />
created a new post for O'Meadhra as<br />
assistive technology consultant, with a remit to advise on how
different types of technology can improve the lives of<br />
visually impaired and blind people.</p>
<p>A year after he started with the bank, he and two other visually
impaired people established the Visually Impaired<br />
Computer Society<br />
(<a href="http://www.iol.ie/~vics">http://www.iol.ie/~vics</a>) to
meet the<br />
needs of partially sighted and blind<br />
programmers. VICS works with<br />
software developers and employers to<br />
ensure that people with sight problems have access to
technology.</p>
<p>The arrival of Windows 95 infuriated<br />
members of the society as it was<br />
completely inaccessible to people with visual impairments. VICS
joined US<br />
campaigners in their campaign to make<br />
the software accessible.</p>
<p>As a result Microsoft has taken steps to improve its
accessibility record -<br />
Microsoft even boasts an accessibility site with resources and
information for those with disabilities<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.microsoft.com/enable/">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/</a>).<br />

Among the factors that persuaded<br />
Microsoft to act were rumours that the US defence forces would not
buy the<br />
product if it were not made accessible to the blind.</p>
<p>O'Meadhra has recently been granted a<br />
two-year secondment from the bank to<br />
concentrate on his further role as<br />
chairman at the Irish Institute of Design and Disability - a body
that represents the needs and rights of disabled people to lead a
normal life (<a href="http://www.idd.ie">http://www.idd.ie</a>).
The UK has a sister organisation to the IDD - the Institute for
Inclusive Design (<a href=
"http://www.ukiid.org">http://www.ukiid.org</a>).</p>
<p>He is currently hard at work at the<br />
Institute of Design and Disability<br />
seeking to promote the adoption of the Barcelona declaration<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.idd.ie/Barcelona_Declaratio">http://www.idd.ie/Barcelona_Declaratio</a>
n.htm) by all local authorities in Eire and Northern Ireland. The
government has<br />
provided funding of 300,000 Irish Punts over three years to aid
wider<br />
implementation of the declaration, which aims to promote inclusion
and<br />
accessibility throughout all regions in which it has been
signed.</p>
<p>Among his many other tasks for the<br />
institute, he built the organisation's web site in 10 days. In
building the site<br />
O'Meadhra deliberately set out to see if he could build it without
HTML, so he<br />
used Microsoft's FrontPage and hit<br />
another problem with the corporations<br />
software. He found that the hierarchical navigational structure of
the program<br />
was difficult for a blind person to<br />
organise. He has since published a<br />
report highlighting his experience using FrontPage to design a
website, which<br />
will be available at the VICS website<br />
shortly.</p>
<p>The institute's motto is 'Good design<br />
enables, bad design disables'. "My<br />
ultimate aim is to see industry and<br />
design schools teaching accessible<br />
design. You have to expect the disabled person to be a user and
cater for<br />
everybody," O'Meadhra says.</p>
<p>"Everything I've wanted to do I've had to climb a high wall.
There is significant discrimination in Ireland. It takes twice as
much work to achieve a managerial<br />
level - the exams aren't even in an<br />
accessible format. There's a general shift in the right direction
but it's still<br />
obstructed. We've got a long way to go."</p>

<p><strong>SECTION THREE: LEGAL FOCUS</strong></p>

<li>Olympics website.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AUSTRALIAN CASE IS WARNING</strong><br />
<strong>FOR WEB DESIGNERS.</strong></p>
<h1><a name="section-1." id="section-1.">* In August 2000 the
Sydney Organising</a></h1>
Committee for the Olympic Games<br />
(SOCOG) was found to have engaged in<br />
unlawful conduct by providing a web<br />
site which was to a significant extent inaccessible to the blind
(see E-Access Bulletin issues 9, 10 and 11). In this article Tom
Worthington, one of the<br />
expert witnesses called in this landmark case, describes how
complainant Bruce<br />
Maguire won the day.
<p>On 7 June 1999, the blind sports fan<br />
Bruce Maguire made a complaint to the<br />
Australian Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission<br />
(<a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au">http://www.hreoc.gov.au</a>)
that he was<br />
unlawfully discriminated against by<br />
SOCOG in their failure to provide a web site which was accessible
to him.</p>
<p>As part of the case, at the request of the Public Interest
Advocacy Centre, two<br />
expert witnesses prepared reports for<br />
Maguire on the accessibility of the<br />
Olympics website. The witnesses were<br />
Jutta Treviranus, manager of the<br />
Adaptive Technology Resource Centre<br />
at the University of Toronto, and myself.</p>
<p>During the case, SOCOG did not supply<br />
technical details about the web site<br />
requested by the complainant's experts, claiming the information
was "highly<br />
commercially sensitive information". At another stage SOCOG argued
that<br />
responsibility for any problems with the site lay with its
contractor, US<br />
technology giant IBM. However, this<br />
was not accepted and no complaint was<br />
made against IBM.</p>
<p>Technical details requested were a<br />
sample page in electronic format from<br />
the proposed Results Table on the<br />
SOCOG website relating to the Olympic<br />
Games; the content plan for the Olympic website; the number of
templates to be used; the details of the tools used to generate the
pages of the Olympic<br />
website; and detailed calculations of<br />
certain 'ball park' figures.</p>
<p>As this information was not supplied, it was necessary for the
experts to examine the information which was available on the site
to evaluate the design and<br />
estimate the cost and time needed to<br />
make the site accessible.</p>
<p>The 'Bobby' web-based tool<br />
(<a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby">http://www.cast.org/bobby</a>)
was used to test three selected web pages for<br />
acessibility. The pages were displayed using Internet Explorer
(Version 5.0 for Windows 95), with image display<br />
switched off to simulate use by a blind person. The display of the
web pages<br />
was inspected for usability and then an examination of the HTML
source code<br />
made.</p>
<p>Use of the Bobby tool proved difficult, due to the extensive use
of frames on the site, requiring each frame to be<br />
submitted separately. Based on the<br />
inspection the conclusion was that the SOCOG Web Site was
inaccessible to<br />
the blind for three main reasons:</p>
<p>First, descriptive 'ALT' text tags were not included on all
images. As an<br />
example the graphic at the top of the<br />
page which linked to 'home' had no<br />
caption.</p>
<p>Second, tables were not laid out so as to be read in a linear
way. Tables contained multiple lines of wrapped text, which<br />
access devices like Braille readers would read unintelligibly
across the rows.</p>
<p>And third, the 'Sports home page' carried a list of sports in
one large image map, which was unreadable by non-text<br />
readers.</p>
<p>In the absence of the technical<br />
information requested from SOCOG, a<br />
number of assumptions were made to<br />
estimate the cost of changing the web<br />
site for accessibility.</p>
<p>Based on the games' format of 300<br />
events across 28 sports with some extra templates needed for
general pages it<br />
was estimated a total of 357 web<br />
templates would be needed. It was<br />
further assumed that the tools used to design the web site have
provision for usability options such as the inclusion of 'ALT'
tags, and therefore no additional cost was included for new
tools.</p>
<p>Finally, an estimate of just over three weeks for one web
developer to assess<br />
the templates, make the changes and<br />
carry out tests was calculated. The cost of the changes on the
basis of a<br />
consultant's rate per day of 1,900 US<br />
Dollars was therefore estimated at<br />
29,450 Dollars.</p>
<p>The decision was delivered 24 August<br />
2000, with SOCOG found to have<br />
breached section 24 of the Australian<br />
Disability Discrimination Act 1992.<br />
HREOC dismissed claims by the<br />
committee that the cost and difficulty in providing an accessible
site would<br />
impose on the respondent "a level of<br />
hardship which could not be justified".</p>
<p>It dismissed claims that the number of templates was as high as
1,295 and that the reformatting of templates would take hours each
- "a more realistic estimate for the minor changes required is
10<br />
minutes each . . . the cost of making the site accessible is a
modest amount."</p>
<p>A declaration that SOCOG do all that<br />
was necessary to render its web site<br />
accessible by the commencement of the<br />
Olympic Games was therefore issued.<br />
Subsequently, on 6 November 2000<br />
(after the Olympics) the web site was<br />
found to only be partly compliant and<br />
20,000 Australian Dollars was awarded<br />
in damages, which SOCOG paid.</p>
<p>It should be noted that no web designers from IBM or SOCOG gave
evidence to<br />
the commission as to who, how or why<br />
the web site was designed the way it<br />
was.</p>
<p>The Australian Internet Industry<br />
Association (<a href=
"http://www.iia.net.au">http://www.iia.net.au</a>)<br />
subsequently warned that the SOGOC<br />
decision meant: "Disability access is a serious consideration for
any Australian business wanting to establish a presence on the
Internet. Sites which target<br />
customers overseas might also be liable under equivalent
legislation in the US, Canada, the UK and elsewhere."</p>
<p>However, there is little indication that Australian corporations
are taking the threat seriously.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: READER</strong><br />
<strong>RESPONSE</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>COLOURFUL LANGUAGE.</strong></p>
<p>There has been a huge response from<br />
readers to last issue's query from David Porter about a hand-held
device to help blind people select clothes to wear<br />
without choosing clashing colours, by<br />
emitting sound signals (E-Access<br />
Bulletin, April 2001).</p>
<p>Fred Gissoni of the American Printing<br />
House for the Blind (APH), was one of<br />
many writing in with details of a device manufactured by the
Austrian company<br />
Caretec known as 'ColorTest'. In the US, it is sold by his
organisation at a price of 595 US Dollars (see<br />
<a href=
"http://sun1.aph.org/products/colortes.ht">http://sun1.aph.org/products/colortes.ht</a>
m).</p>
<p>He says the device is approximately 15 centimetres long, 4cm
wide and 3cm<br />
thick. It is powered by a rechargeable battery. On the face of the
device near the sensing end are two buttons, one<br />
convex and one concave. When the<br />
convex button is pressed, a digitised<br />
voice announces the name of a colour<br />
from a library of about 150 (versions are available in several
languages). When<br />
the concave button is pressed,<br />
information is given on three other<br />
aspects of the colour: brightness, hue and saturation.</p>
<p>'Brightness', presented on a scale from zero to 9.9, represents
the amount of<br />
reflected light in the colour. 'Hue' tells where within the visual
spectrum the<br />
observed colour falls. red is 3, blue 6, green 9 and yellow 12 - so
for example a reading of 7.5 might be turquoise.<br />
'Saturation' is an indication of the<br />
strength or depth of colour.</p>
<p>If one presses the 'eye' of the instrument against a bit of
clothing and holds down the convex button, a tone is heard. By
moving the end of the instrument over<br />
the surface, variation in tone can aid in determining information
about whether a garment is solid, striped or of another pattern,
although precise detail is not available.</p>
<p>Gissoni has personal experience of the device. "My wife and I
have used the<br />
device for upwards of three years and, despite some shortcomings,
are pleased with it. It enables us to perform tasks that would
otherwise be impossible."</p>
<p>In the UK, this same device is marketed as the 'Colourtest-150'
by Vis-ability (<a href=
"http://ww.vis-ability.co.uk">http://ww.vis-ability.co.uk</a>).
Richard West is a UK user: "It is a hand-held<br />
device, rather like a torch. It worked fairly well, but had a price
tag of several hundred pounds [it currently retails at 450 UK
Pounds], so I never felt it worth getting. However, for a blind
person<br />
living alone, it might have sufficient benefit to justify the
expenditure.</p>
<p>Several other readers wrote in to<br />
recommend ColorTest. They included<br />
Lindy van der Merwe of Johannesburg,<br />
South Africa, who says: "It is a truly wonderful device that not
enough<br />
visually impaired people know about.<br />
The ColorTest can also detect a source of light, thus enabling me,
as a totally blind person, to find out if lights are on or off. I
have even used it to identify the colour of the roses in my
garden.</p>
<p>"However, although the device can<br />
identify colours, it will still be up to the person to decide which
colours go<br />
together. It might for instance be a good idea to try and find some
information on the matching of colours in books."</p>
<p>Other advocates included E Marie-Lewis who says ColorTest is
"extremely<br />
reliable"; Pratik Patel, Project Manager at CUNY Assistive
Technology<br />
Services, who calls it "an excellent<br />
device"; and Anna Dresner.</p>

Not only can you buy a 'Talking Color<br />
Identifier' here (which appears to be the ColorTest device under a
different<br />
name) but also a range of other devices from talking money
identifiers to talking compasses and talking thermometers.</p>
<p>Peter Meijer, inventor of the auditory 'soundscape' device
'vOICe' (see EAccess<br />
Bulletin, Issue 13, January 2001)<br />
wrote in to point out that his invention could also be used to
describe colours.</p>
<p>"You can use The vOICe auditory<br />
display software<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.seeingwithsound.com/winv">http://www.seeingwithsound.com/winv</a><br />

oice.htm) with a cheap colour web-cam<br />
to have the colour spoken of whatever is at the centre of the
camera view."</p>
<p>He also sends in a link to a<br />
comprehensive table comparing all sorts of other light probes and
colour sensors, maintained by Tiresias, at:<br />

<p>Finally, Janet Wicks, wrote in to<br />
mention that the UK company Lextile<br />
Braille has developed a way of putting Braille labels on clothing.
