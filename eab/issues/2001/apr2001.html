<p><strong>TREASURY BANKS ON DEAFBLIND</strong><br />
<strong>ACCESS.</strong></p>
<p>A 0.5 million UK Pounds research project into tactile Internet
access began this week with the backing of a three UK government
agencies.</p>
<p>The project aims to create a computer<br />
communication device unifying tactile mice, gloves and screens with
traditional deafblind communication techniques of palm spelling,
tactile Morse code and 'tadoma', a way to recognise speech with
touch.</p>
<p>Funding for the research comes from the Treasury's 62 million
'Invest to Save' budget, which was channelled through the<br />
Department of Health to the Defence<br />
Evaluation and Research Agency, which will be overseeing the
work.</p>
<p>According to Maurice Bardsley at DERA, the research secured
funding partly because it may help the government to reach its
targets for the provision of government services online. A Treasury
spokesperson said the savings which Invest to Save required of
Invest to Save projects can be "savings in terms of convenience,"
not just of public money.</p>
<p>The DERA team will collaborate with<br />
researchers at the Sensory Disabilities Research Unit at the
University of<br />
Hertfordshire<br />
(<a href=
"http://phoenix.herts.ac.uk/SDRU/hmpage.ht">http://phoenix.herts.ac.uk/SDRU/hmpage.ht</a>
ml); and Deafblind UK<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.deafblinduk.org.uk">http://www.deafblinduk.org.uk</a>),
a charity which plans to find deafblind people to test the
technology. Dr John Gill, who heads the RNIB's scientific research
unit, will sit on the project's management board.</p>

<p><strong>THE BULLETIN GOES MULTILINGUAL.</strong></p>
<p>This issue sees the launch of an Italian language version of
E-Access Bulletin, in partnership with the Cavazza Institute in
Bologna.</p>
<p>The concept is the brainchild of the institute's director Mario
Barbuto, who offered to translate each issue and the necessary
subscription messages, and to help promote the bulletin in Italy.
The Cavazza Institute for the Blind, founded in 1881, is one of
Italy's leading organisations in the field of blindness. Its
wide-ranging work includes education, vocational training, the
distribution of technical devices, and Braille and talking book
production.</p>
<p>The institute's Italian language web site is at <a href=
"http://www.cavazza.it/">www.cavazza.it</a> and information on
the<br />
Italian version of E-Access Bulletin including an archive can be
found at<br />
<a href=
"http://www.cavazza.it/eab">http://www.cavazza.it/eab</a><br />
To subscribe, Italian readers simply send a blank email to:<br />
<a href=
"mailto:eab-it-subs@headstar.com">eab-it-subs@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin is seeking partners in other countries to
create new language versions. Partners will share copyright in
their language version, and be able to promote their work through
it. So if you represent an organisation outside the UK working with
blind and visually impaired people, perhaps you could help us
produce our next version in French, Spanish, Portuguese,
Russian,<br />
Norwegian, Swedish . . . the world's the limit! Please email the
bulletin's Dan Jellinek on <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> with your
proposal.</p>
<p><strong>PRET A PORTER.</strong></p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin reader David Porter, who is visually impaired,
has sent in a query about a hand-held device to help blind people
select clothes to wear without choosing clashing colours, by
emitting sound signals.</p>
<p>"My interest is in something which would enable totally blind
people to find articles of clothing electronically, which would
enable them to dress in appropriate colours or shades", he says.
"This would be a great advance on sewing buttons to various<br />
garments, so that they could be matched by button combinations.
Some time ago I heard of the hand-held device and would like to
hear from anyone who may know anything more about it". However, he
adds that "even when my sight was normal, I could never match
clothing colours which my wife said were right!"</p>
<p>If anyone has heard of such a device, please email the editor on
<a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> and we will
pass the information on to David.</p>
<p><strong>ITALIAN GOVERNMENT SITE OPEN</strong><br />
<strong>FOR TESTING.</strong></p>
<p>The Italian government has taken the<br />
innovative step of opening up a test version of its main web site
for accessibility testing ahead of its relaunch later this
year.</p>
<p>The test site, which has been publicised to the Italian speaking
blind and visually impaired community through the World Wide
Web<br />
Consortium's accessibility initiative, is at <a href=
"http://194.242.231.57">http://194.242.231.57</a> and can be
accessed using user name: 'wai' and password:<br />
'demo'. It will eventually come online to replace the one currently
at<br />
<a href="http://www.governo.it">http://www.governo.it</a>,</p>
<p>The move follows a directive from the Italian government
"inviting" all web designers who are in a position to comply with
W3C web accessibility guidelines to do so � a<br />
compromise wording after legislation forcing accessibility was
ruled out.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNET USERS LOOK BACK ON</strong><br />
<strong>RADIO DAYS.</strong></p>
<p>A new email discussion group has been<br />
created to provide a platform for blind and sighted people to
reminisce about favourites of radio.</p>
<p>The group was started by Clive Lever of the Visually Impaired
Radio and Electronics Society (VIRES), an organisation promoting
the use enjoyment of radio and electronics by blind and visually
impaired people.</p>
<p>"If you get half-a-dozen blind people together in a bar, within
the first hour, the chances are that some of them will be
comparing<br />
experiences of radio", Lever says.</p>
<p>Recent topics discussed on the list range from radio versions of
Balzac's Old Goriot to Meet the Huggets, a programme for
children<br />
broadcast on BBC Radio 2. To join in, send a blank message to
uk-radio-listenerssubscribe<br />

<p><strong>CYBERSATIRISTS WANTED.</strong></p>
<p>Web designers with an axe to grind about accessibility are
invited to volunteer their ideas and services to produce a web site
parodying the worst in commercial web<br />
design.</p>
<p>Once complete Joe Clark, the accessibility guru behind the
project, says that the site will say to users: "After you're done
laughing, you can learn how we made what seems to be a perfectly
ordinary site completely<br />
accessible."</p>
<p>Since issuing his invitation to comedy coders in late May, Clark
has been sent a handful of good ideas and had pledges of help from
over twenty designers, but he is still keen to enlist more. To get
involved email<br />

<p><strong>VOTING IN PRIVATE - A BASIC HUMAN</strong><br />
<strong>RIGHT.</strong><br />
By Tamara Fletcher <a href=
"mailto:tamara@headstar.com">tamara@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>If something good were to emerge from the US election fiasco in
Florida, it could be that America takes a closer look at how their
voting system could be improved, including new access facilities
allowing people with disabilities to vote, unaided, in the privacy
of their own booth.</p>
<p>From September last year, Texas reluctantly led the way with a
law - forced through by litigation lasting a decade - requiring
that any county in the state purchasing new voting equipment had to
buy machines that are accessible to all. However in other states,
disabled or visually impaired people who are not able to cast their
own vote still have to be accompanied by another person to verify
or cast the vote for them.</p>
<p>In the UK, in the forthcoming general<br />
election voters will benefit from new<br />
legislation � the Representation of the People Act 2000 - requiring
that all polling stations must use a 'tactile ballot template' to
slot over the ballot paper. Stations must also display a large
print copy of the ballot paper, and a person requiring assistance
in the voting booth is now legally entitled to second-person
support.</p>
<p>The tactile ballot template was developed in consultation with
organisations representing the interests of the blind or visually
impaired including RNIB and launched by the Home Office in March.
The template will slot over the ballot paper with raised numbers
and Braille to represent each candidate. The voter will be able to
lift the area of the template next to the corresponding number to
mark the ballot paper and make his or her decision privately.</p>
<p>Research by the RNIB shows that 60 per cent of blind or visually
impaired people voted at the last general election, compared with
71.5 per cent of the total UK electorate. More than half of those
that did not vote felt that it was too difficult.</p>
<p>The institute hopes that the figure will improve this time
around, although according to Dermot Ryan, Campaigns Officer
for<br />
accessible information, there are still a few problems associated
with the new tactile device.</p>
<p>"While it's fantastic that the device has been implemented, the
Home Office have not<br />
given any money to publicise it so many people won't actually know
about it", Ryan said. "Many people who are visually impaired don't
look it and the use of the device in individual polling stations
depends largely on the vigilance of the presiding officer
recognising them as such.</p>
<p>"The device also has limitations as the presiding officer will
need to tell the voter which number represents which candidate if
they are unable to see the large print posters."</p>
<p>The Electoral Reform Society has similar reservations.</p>
<p>"The Home Office is progressing quite<br />
slowly, which is disappointing", says Alex Folkes, the society's
Press and Campaigns Officer. These are small steps in the right
direction � however many people will still have to be
accompanied".</p>
<p>"Small moves are being made in one area but not in others. It's
a very serious issue � people should be able to vote privately
unassisted. Having someone standing over you is a disincentive to
vote.</p>
<p>"The Home Office seem to be offloading all the responsibility on
to the Electoral Commission. I think there will be little impact on
this election. Hopefully, they will look seriously at these issues
for next time".</p>
<p>The RNIB also seem optimistic about<br />
changes for the election in 2005 or 2006. "We imagine the next
election will be very different with a promotional campaign, more
people registering to vote by post and a move towards electronic
voting", Ryan says.</p>
<p>At this year's general election a voluntary survey will issued
to the administrators and returning officers so that the feedback
can be used by the Electoral Commission. One<br />
question covers the effectiveness of the tactile voting device.</p>
<p>"The general consensus is that if everyone is happy with it, it
will probably stay as it is", says Home Office spokesman Martin
Ellis. "Electronic voting has been considered but obviously one
factor is cost, although it has not been ruled out."</p>
<p>Scope, the national disability organisation whose focus is
people with cerebral palsy, is to publish results of a nationwide
survey of polling stations across the country for the Polls Apart 3
campaign. The website,<br />
<a href="http://www.pa3.org.uk/">www.pa3.org.uk</a> is due to go
live shortly. Scope are calling for disabled voters to complete a
survey after they have voted to aid their research, and this will
be made available from this site.</p>
<p>The RNIB has published a factsheet on voting and will also be
looking for feedback on good and bad practice to help their
campaign for further improvements after the election. For more

<p><strong>A FAREWELL TO WIRES AND CABLES.</strong><br />
By Kevin Carey <a href=
"mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Bluetooth, named after the 10th century Viking King Harald
Blatand who united<br />
Denmark and Norway, is a wireless<br />
communications protocol set to revolutionise the way blind people
can access technology in the home and office.</p>
<p>Developed by the mobile phone giant<br />
Ericsson and already adopted by such<br />
companies as IBM, Microsoft, Nokia,<br />
Motorola and Sony, it uses radio frequencies to enable a wide
variety of devices to communicate with each other over short
distances.</p>
<p>It expands the possibilities for devices to interact with each
other way beyond the personal computer and its standard peripheral
devices so that telephones, computers, consumer electronics,
navigation systems and security devices can all communicate without
the usual messing about with wires and cables.</p>
<p>In the office environment, Bluetooth will scrap the need for
cables between pieces of equipment and make flexibility of
ownership and use much more practical. And because it is
radio-based there will be no need for the 'lines of sight' between
equipment required by infra-red systems.</p>
<p>From the point of view of blind and visually impaired people
this means that interaction will be easier between specially
adapted kit and the ordinary stuff in the office. It also means
that you will be able to avoid the tedium of updating information
in currently incompatible devices like a Braille note-taker and a
mobile phone, so that if you update the address book in your phone
it will update the note-taker simultaneously. This will mean it is
also much easier to change devices.</p>
<p>At home it really will be possible for your remote controller to
drive everything from your television to your cooker timer and your
curtains. The dream of the 'smart house' will finally come true.
This will be particularly important for people who find moving
around difficult but it will also save a good deal of dragging
ones' hands across mucky surfaces to find a cooker knob.</p>
<p>Out and about it will now be possible for phones to link
efficiently with satellite navigation systems so that it will be
easier to find out where you are and specify where you want to go.
At the macro level this means that your mobile phone will be able
to tell you to within five metres where you are and at the micro
level, as the uptake of the technology improves, you will also be
able to find small objects such as the door handle of a specified
shop.</p>
<p>You will also be able to use your own hand held device to
interrogate public information systems and operate a bank cash
machine, although for the next few years you will still have to
grab bank notes rather than down loading digital money into your
phone.</p>
<p>Of course, you can put all this together so that as you leave
the office you can turn your cooker on and as you stand on the
platform waiting for a train that never comes you can turn it off
again.</p>
<p>One of the most important benefits for people with low vision,
particularly the elderly, will be the reduction in learning
required to access new devices. Once you have learned how to
operate your remote controller, your handheld personal assistant or
your laptop you will be able to run all your devices as long as
they are Bluetooth enabled. The mechanism is a tiny chip attached
to each device, together with a couple of lines of enabling
software written into each operating system.</p>

<p><strong>SECTION FOUR: NEWS ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DERA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SPECIAL NEEDS - THE MOTHER OF</strong><br />
<strong>INVENTION?</strong><br />
By Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>The news of the UK government's Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency's<br />
involvement in developing deafblind<br />
technology (see news, this issue) may seem surprising, but such
interest is not<br />
unprecedented and far from sentimental.</p>
<p>DERA, smarting from cuts in defence<br />
spending and in the throes of having much of its operations
semi-privatised, faces strong pressure to turn brainwaves into
bucks.</p>
<p>Furthermore special needs have often inspired some extremely
lucrative inventions: Cassette tapes were first designed to provide
a medium for talking books; Alexander Graham Bell was moved to
develop the telephone as a way to communicate with his partially
deaf wife; Meanwhile, Josiah Wedgewood, the man who gave his name
to a world famous pottery, is often said to have invented the
revolutionary kick-wheel to overcome a problem with his leg. Some
even contend that the idea of the biro came about as a way to stop
visually impaired people knocking over inkpots.</p>
<p>In July the Ministry of Defence is scheduled to spin-off most of
DERA's activities into a company called QinetiQ (pronounced<br />
'kinetic') Plc. This new company, though still part-owned by the
state, will operate on a fully commercial basis. Meanwhile
the<br />
smaller military-research side of DERA will change its name to the
Defence Science and Technology Laboratory but will remain under MoD
control.</p>
<p>When the DERA demerger occurs DERA's<br />
existing assistive technology projects, including the newly funded
deafblind project, will fall under QinetiQ's control. Should a
product based on ideas arising from the research catch on, either
as an aid to deafblind, or in a non-deafblind applications, the
potential profits from intellectual property rights could be
enormous. QinetiQ's military background will mean it is well placed
to market its wares to both civilian and military buyers, the
latter being particularly generous early adopters of new
technology.</p>
<p>There are many possible commercial spinoffs from tactile
interfaces, since the need to send messages in a tactile way can
result from social pressure and sensory overload, not just from
sensory impairment.</p>
<p>A simple tactile feature is already built into many mobile
phones in the form of a<br />
vibrating 'ring'. Some people are already using this facility to
transmit discreet phone messages in Morse code, according to<br />
BTexaCT Research (<a href=
"http://www.labs.bt.com">http://www.labs.bt.com</a>).</p>
<p>Similar modes of communication may also find a place on the
battlefield. Louis Braille, the inventor of the Braille system,
developed the concept after learned a writing system called 'night
writing' invented by Charles Barbier in the early nineteenth
century for communicating on the battlefield in the dark.</p>
<p>DERA researcher Trevor Dobbins heads a tactile interface project
which aims to find reliable tactile ways to relay navigational data
from a global positioning satellite. As part of the research
Dobbins equipped Steve<br />
Cunningham with gadgets allowing him to set the blind water-speed
record of 70 mph in a boat on lake Windermere in October last year
(see <a href=
"http://www.blindvision.co.uk/">www.blindvision.co.uk</a>). A month
earlier DERA's technology helped Graham 'GForce'<br />
Hicks, a deafblind man, ride a pillion jet ski from Lands End to
the Isle of Scilly (see <a href=
"http://www.deafblinduk.org.uk/text/quadbike).">www.deafblinduk.org.uk/text/quadbike).</a></p>
<p>From defence to derring-do, tactile<br />
technology could be one of the secrets to the success of the newly
privatised QinetiQ.</p>
