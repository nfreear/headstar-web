<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Audio-Description Subsidy Bid.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB is to urge the government to subsidise the technology
 needed to receive audio-described digital television, to ensure
 affordable access to description for all who need it, E-Access Bulletin
 has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 A proposal will be delivered to broadcasting minister Kim Howells
 later this month for three million pounds to subsidise the production of
 around 20,000 plug-in cards to allow users to access audio description
 on Freeview, the digital terrestrial service run by a consortium headed
 by the BBC.
</p>
<p> 
 If successful the bid could see audio description available later this
 year to visually impaired people at a cost of two hundred and fifty
 pounds - 110 pounds for the card and 150 pounds for the set-top
 decoder box.
</p>
<p> 
 When inserted into Freeview decoders the cards, designed by SCM
 Microsystems (<a href="http://www.scmmicro.com">http://www.scmmicro.com</a>
), allow viewers to play an audio description track over headphones or through an amplifier into
 loudspeakers. Many hours of audio described programming are
 produced by the BBC, ITV, Channel Four and Channel Five each
 week, but go unwatched because there is no suitable decoder on the
 market.
</p>
<p> 
 Alongside the funding bid, the plug-in is due to be tested by 45 people
 who have been part of a group assessing broadcasters' audio
 description output using makeshift technology for the past three years
 run by the Digital Network, a consortium of broadcasters. The man
 running the trial, Jim Slater, does not expect the change to the units
 to present any technical problem.
 "Everybody who has audio description loves it," says Slater. "The only
 negative feedback is that there is not enough."
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Audio descriptions of video e-learning material could be
 automated by technology being developed by French company Ecrans
 Magique. The company, which specialises in technology that
 categorises online content, is looking for research partners to
 collaborate on 'VoxVision'. Interested companies or universities
 should contact director Jean-Paul Decle on <a href="mailto:jpdecle@wanadoo.fr">jpdecle@wanadoo.fr</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i38-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Concern Over Direction Of European Law.</h3>
<p> 
 Plans for European legislation designed to ensure widespread access to
 digital television and third generation mobile services need to be
 radically reconsidered if they are to protect the rights of people with
 disabilities, according to international lobby groups.
</p>
<p> 
 The legislation, which is scheduled to be considered by the European
 Parliament by the end of 2003, will set out a framework within which
 broadcasting and communications regulators in EU member states will
 operate to ensure that interactive communications services are widely
 available.
</p>
<p> 
 However, at a meeting with the European Commission on 4 February,
 disability groups expressed concern that a report outlining the proposed
 direction of the legislation (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/EU5">http://fastlink.headstar.com/EU5</a>
) focuses on rolling out the technology infrastructure and the costs of services
 but overlooks the needs of people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 "We were amazed that the commission can put out a report on access
 to services without mentioning accessibility," said Cathy Toscan of the
 European Design for All e-Accessibility Network (<a href="http://www.e-accessibility.org">http://www.e-accessibility.org</a>
). According to Toscan, the commission has "promised
 to take a closer look at accessibility issues" before a final report is
 drawn up.
</p>
<p> 
 Separately, the commission has supported a proposal for a UN
 Convention that would protect and promote the rights of disabled
 people, which is scheduled to be discussed at a UN committee meeting
 in June. The European Disability Forum campaign group
 (<a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm">http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm</a>
) welcomed the move but emphasised that support from member states is essential. "Because of
 UN regulations, member states must negotiate as individuals rather
 than as communities, so it is important for ministers of foreign
 affairs to know about this issue and support it," said a spokesperson.
</p>
<h3 id="i38-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Guidelines For Accessible Online Forms.</h3>
<p> 
 Guidelines to help developers design accessible online forms were
 published this month by forms software company Mandoforms
 (<a href="http://www.mandoforms.com">http://www.mandoforms.com</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The Manchester-based firm began drafting the guidance after an RNIB
 audit in August last year identified potential access problems with its
 forms.
</p>
<p> 
 According to product manager Kevin Trembath, the many accessibility
 pitfalls for online forms include not allowing people to use the
 keyboard to move the cursor between fields in a form; to make error
 messages hard for people using screen-readers by not putting them at
 the top of the screen; or to use a colour such as red to indicate there
 is a problem.
</p>
<p> 
 To provide an accessible form using the current version of
 Mandoforms software, version 4.1, designers need to provide a
 separate page. But the next version of the software will allow designers
 to make just one version accessible to everyone, Trembath says. "Our
 overall goal is universal design."

<h3 id="i38-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Signals From Space Through The Internet.</h3>
<p> 
 Detailed spoken navigation instructions in an outdoor environment,
 accurate to 'a few metres', could be made available to visually
 impaired people with new satellite and wireless internet technology
 being tested this month by volunteers from ONCE, Spain's national
 organisation of the blind (<a href="http://www.once.es">http://www.once.es</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Until now, positioning data from satellites has only been accurate to
 around 40 metres, and connections are easily lost in areas with tall
 buildings and underpasses.
</p>
<p> 
 The volunteers will test a small navigator that can be carried in a
 shoulder bag. The device, developed by GMV Sistemas
 (<a href="http://www.gmvsistemas.es">http://www.gmvsistemas.es</a>
), combines data from satellites and mobile phone networks to deliver location information in voice and Braille
 formats. Because the system uses phone networks, systems could also
 be developed to allow users to request location-specific directions or
 assistance.
</p>
<p> 
 The satellite positioning data for the service is provided by the
 European Space Agency via an internet-enabled network called
 SISNet, which stands for 'signal-in-space through the internet' (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/sisnet">http://fastlink.headstar.com/sisnet</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="i38-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: The Dating Game.</h3>
<p> 
 A virtual dating game launched by the RNIB for Valentine's Day aims
 to prove that accessible web sites do not have to be boring.
</p>
<p> 
 'RNIB Blind Date: an accessible game for Valentine's Day'
 (<a href="http://rnibblinddate.nomensa.com">http://rnibblinddate.nomensa.com</a>
) uses Flash animation to lead the player through an interactive adventure in which players have a choice
 of who to take on their blind date and where to go. In one possible
 story, players can take the sophisticated Tara to the cinema to watch
 an
 audio-described film; in another, you can invite James the 'technology
 genius' (or is that computer geek?) to a party (tip: order him a pizza).
 Just like in real life, depending on the choices made the evening can
 turn out to be a success or a disaster.
</p>
<p> 
 Developed for the RNIB by design company Nomensa
 (<a href="http://www.nomensa.com">http://www.nomensa.com</a>
), the game can be used with standard screen reader software. It was produced as part of the institute's campaign
 for good web design (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital">http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital</a>
) to make web designers aware of accessibility guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 A poll undertaken to coincide with the launch to find the UK's best
 looking celebrity saw Tony Blair out-voted by over-weight comedian
 Johnny Vegas. That proved, according to the RNIB, that love is indeed
 blind.

<h3 id="i38-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: SOUND RESPONSE:</h3>
<p>  Crispin Jewitt, director of the National Sound Archive (NSA) at the British Library, has written in to respond
 to Clive Lever's account of negative experiences when visiting the
 archive (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 36, December 2002).
</p>
<p> 
 He says: "Provision of services for the visually impaired has greatly
 improved since Clive's first visit in the early 1990s to the Victorian
 premises then occupied by the NSA. The new British Library at St
 Pancras incorporates far more facilities for the disabled.
</p>
<p> 
 "To deal with the points relating to Clive's visits, I assure your
 readers that the library makes no charge to those wishing to access its
 collection and there never has been any question of users having to
 'pay up first . and take your chance'. The catalogue of the NSA is
 available on the library's website (<a href="http://www.bl.uk">http://www.bl.uk</a>
) and on terminals in public areas.
</p>
<p> 
 "The British Library now has a readers' adviser whose role is to help
 users with disabilities to make the most of its facilities. Help
 available ranges from assistance with forms for readers' passes to escorting
 readers around the building and introducing them to the specialist
 equipment available in the reading rooms. For NSA users specialist
 staff are available to show users to the study carrels and explain how
 to use the equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 "For readers with visual impairments, some leaflets are available in
 large print format and on tape. In addition the library issues passes
 to those assisting readers with disabilities and assistance dogs are also
 welcome in the reading rooms.
</p>
<p> 
 "The library is committed to improving the level of service it offers
 to users with disabilities and welcomes feedback. I hope this sets the
 record straight and trust that Clive's next visit to the library will
 be a 100 per cent joyful experience."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>: SECTION THREE: REPORT- DIGITAL POLITICS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: VOICES FOR CHANGE.by Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Hundreds of visually impaired and deaf-blind lobbyists from across the
 UK descended on Parliament last week to protest that their needs in
 accessing vital new technologies such as digital television were set to
 be bypassed by the new Communications Bill
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bill1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bill1</a>
) currently before the Commons.</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB-organised lobby was convened to press for some 57
 amendments to the bill, and the atmosphere as the protestors filled
 Westminster Hall to corner their MPs was one of indignance.
</p>
<p> 
 Lesley Kelly, honorary secretary of the UK National Federation of the
 Blind (<a href="http://www.nfbuk.org">http://www.nfbuk.org</a>
) said: "We are hoping that someone will take notice of the fact blind people need access to the TV and radio
 and
 that the publicity will make people notice. What bothers me is that no
 one really seems aware of the need for telecommunications to be
 accessible: the manufacturers need to know."
</p>
<p> 
 The lobby's organisers urged visually impaired technology users - who
 are the experts on these issues, after all - to explain to their MPs
 the daily usability problems that they encounter, such as remote control
 handset buttons which often use colour to distinguish between
 functions. One suggestion for a practical demonstration was to ask
 MPs to cover up their mobile phone screen with a label and then ask
 them to attempt to use it.
</p>
<p> 
 As a minimum, lobbyists want to see all their proposed amendments
 established as guidelines for the new communications 'super-regulator'
 Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">http://www.ofcom.org.uk</a>
), which becomes operational later this year.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB supports the creation of a single regulator for the
 communications, internet and broadcasting industries because this may
 provide an effective joined-up approach to tackling accessibility
 obstacles. However lobbyists wanted to see increased pressure on
 Ofcom to use its powers to promote universal access and 'inclusive'
 product design with an enforceable framework that will ensure
 improved access to electronic programme guides, the text menus that
 will be a key feature of digital television.
</p>
<p> 
 Some lobbyists said they felt angry for paying for services for which
 they cannot reap the full benefits. "We are subsidising the whole
 service but not receiving it completely," one person told E-Access
 Bulletin. "We want every piece of menu-driven media equipment to be
 accessible for all."
</p>
<p> 
 Among key objectives demanded by the lobby on the day was that
 audio description be included not on ten per cent of all broadcasts -
 as laid out in the bill - but be increased to 50 per cent over a ten year
 period. They also sought a guarantee that the audio description will be
 receivable on all digital platforms at a price which is not
 significantly more expensive than standard equipment.
</p>
<p> 
 While there is the occasional late-night audio described broadcast on
 terrestrial television, Sky Digital is the only digital service to
 offer basic audio-description. Sky now carries listings of audio described
 programmes on its web site and is working on providing the service via
 telephone (<a href="http://www1.sky.com/disability/tvguide.htm">http://www1.sky.com/disability/tvguide.htm</a>
). The RNIB wants others to follow suit, and would like to see description made
 available through software downloads, although this would still require
 set-top boxes and televisions to be upgraded.
</p>
<p> 
 "We do not want expensive add-ons," said Chris Friend of Sightsavers
 International and the World Blind Union.
</p>
<p> 
 Mary Ghatineh, a deafblind lobbyist, said: "I hope to raise awareness
 of the specific needs that people with sensory loss face each day when
 they want to use information and communication equipment. Now its
 going to be digital, these people will find it worse. I want the
 government to make changes so digital equipment manufacturers will
 consider accessible formats."
</p>
<p> 
 New communications technologies have the potential to bring strong
 practical and financial advantages to the growing section of society
 with visual and combined dual sensory impairments: the ability to
 shop, to email a care worker, to vote, to check the entertainments
 listings, to book a taxi, or pay bills. However, the protestors said that
 if MPs fail to act now, people with sight problems even stand to lose out
 on access to radio services in the digital era.
</p>
<p> 
 As Labour backbencher MP Dr Roger Berry told the gathering: "We
 have the technology, we can make communications technology
 accessible, all we need now is the political will."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: SEEING IT WRONG?by Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB's web accessibility audit scheme, 'See it Right,'
 (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital/siraccess/">http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital/siraccess/</a>
), checks sites for ease of use by visually impaired users. To receive a logo that denotes it has
 'passed,' a site must attain what the RNIB describes as a 'reasonable
 standard of accessibility', and is then subject to annual re-audits.
</p>
<p> 
 See it Right uses test reviewers to visit and check sites rather than
 simply using automated review software, and bases its checks on the
 international standards set out by the World Wide Web consortium's
 Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-</a>

 WEBCONTENT). Auditors check, for example, that all images have
 text alternatives and check that links have clear destinations. Detailed
 reports are then compiled with any examples of inaccessible features.
</p>
<p> 
 Users are also encouraged to report inaccessibility on sites bearing
 the logo (by emailing <a href="mailto:webaccess@rnib.org.uk.">webaccess@rnib.org.uk.</a>) and the RNIB estimates that bringing sites up to standard is equivalent to one to two per cent
 of original design costs (for more on 'See it Right' see E-Access
 Bulletin, issues 26 and 31, February and July 2002).
</p>
<p> 
 The process is being watched with particular interest by public sector
 bodies, since government guidelines require public agencies including
 local councils to ensure their web sites are accessible. Last week
 Welwyn Hatfield Council (<a href="http://www.welhat.gov.uk">http://www.welhat.gov.uk</a>
) became the first English local authority to receive the accreditation, following
 Wrexham council in Wales (<a href="http://www.wrexham.gov.uk">http://www.wrexham.gov.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Other public sector sites to have passed the audit include the main
 government web portal UKOnline (<a href="http://www.ukonline.gov.uk">http://www.ukonline.gov.uk</a>
), Greater Manchester Police (<a href="http://www.gmp.police.uk">http://www.gmp.police.uk</a>
), the Criminal Justice site (<a href="http://www.cjsonline.org">http://www.cjsonline.org</a>
), and the local government Improvement and Development Agency (<a href="http://www.idea.gov.uk">http://www.idea.gov.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 As with all systems of accessibility audit however, the RNIB initiative
 has its critics, who are quick to pounce on any apparent
 inaccessibilities which remain even after sites gain the stamp of
 approval.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Welwyn Hatfield, its site received the See it Right logo
 thanks to an appropriate font size; simple layout; the option of using
 a text only version; the use of descriptive tags to explain the content
 of pictures; easy-to-use navigation and little or no use of complex
 graphics. It also offers the ability to change typeface.
</p>
<p> 
 However Tavis Reddick, a web publishing technologist, told E-Access
 Bulletin this week that he has found an array of inaccessibilities on
 the council's site including moving text on the home page; and use of a
 smaller-than-average font size.
</p>
<p> 
 "If this is held up to other designers as an accessible website template,
 then it could be very damaging to future accessibility design," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 His comments highlight the fact that, alongside a range of accessibility
 features which are fairly simple to assess, there are many areas where
 best practice is more a matter of opinion, and much may depend on
 context and the expert assessment of the site testers.
</p>
<p> 
 Henny Swan, Website Accessibility Best Practice Officer at the RNIB,
 told E-Access Bulletin: "This is exactly the kind of feedback that is
 good as it provides us with the opportunity to discuss the areas of
 accessibility that fall into the 'grey' or 'judgement' areas, where
 interpretation of the WAI guidelines is required."
</p>
<p> 
 "With regards to blinking text, according to our See it Right guidelines
 this is acceptable, if the rotation is both slow and rests after 3-5
 cycles. As with all instances of blinking text in sites that we audit a
 subjective
 decision is made as to how the image affects the page and the scope of
 causing problems for people accessing the page and whether blinking
 text has been used extensively in the site."
</p>
<p> 
 "In Welwyn Hatfield's case there is one image that rotates every three
 seconds which is considered slow. There is also a very small amount of
 text on the two sides of the images which makes it easier to read. In
 addition to this there is a text link directly below the image for users
 to access and the image is tucked away at the bottom of the page. All of
 this creates a strong case for passing the site, especially given
 blinking text has not been used elsewhere."
</p>
<p> 
 "That said, the instance of blinking text was not on the home page
 when the site went through both the initial audit and the re-audit
 which shows how problematic is to monitor sites once audited. This also
 displays how useful it is to get feedback from users! I have been in
 touch with Welwyn Hatfield to notify them of the issue."
</p>
<p> 
 The issue of 'less-than-average' font size was also one discussed with
 the council, Swan said . "The font size on the page is fixed, however
 an 'accessible alternative' is provided in the form of buttons to switch
 text size from the browser default to 16-, 14- and 12-point sizes. These
 images also have alternative text links at the bottom of the page."
</p>
<p> 
 "As this is an accessible alternative, the site passed the audit
 checkpoints. Again this is a unique case and one that requires judgment
 and interpretation of the WAI Guidelines."
</p>
<p> 
 Clearly all this means that automatic software checking can never offer
 the same sophistication of assessment as human checkers. "Automated
 checking tools can only provide 55 per cent accessibility checks, and
 some guidelines may fail an automated check as the tools are unable to
 detect an accessible alternative," Swan says. Subjective it may be, but
 human judgment seems to be the best system we have for accessibility
 testing.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>: SECTION FIVE: PRODUCT REVIEW- TALKING BOOKS.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: PICK OF THE DAISY PLAYERS.by Phil Cain  <a href="mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The DAISY digital book format, developed by an international
 consortium of talking book libraries formed in 1996
 (<a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
), has many advantages to visually impaired people.
</p>
<p> 
 The ability to bookmark a page and search the text for key words
 makes it far easier to find the appropriate section, particularly in
 complex reference works. Also extremely useful is the ability to speed
 up and slow down recorded speech without changing its pitch.
 Meanwhile the option to record in MP3 format, which compresses data
 up to 12 times, allows more audio material to be fitted onto fewer
 discs.
</p>
<p> 
 With no DAISY player hardware manufactured in the UK, however,
 until recently the only way to get hold of a player in the UK has been
 to import one from abroad, a process fraught with pitfalls. Even after
 the user has managed to modify the power supply and translate the
 instructions, he or she will still only have access to technical
 support in another country.
</p>
<p> 
 In December last year the RNIB began to address this gap by selling
 the Victor Reader Pro player from Canada-based company Visuaide.
 According to marketing manager Tom Whittle, some 40 Victor Reader
 Pros have been sold so far at a price of 350 pounds, despite a lack of
 publicity. Among the keenest customers for the device are educational
 bodies, says Whittle. Unlike its rivals, the Pro is designed to cater
 for the sophisticated reading needs of students, with a number pad making
 it easy to skip between numbered pages easily (for a review of this
 reader by Saqib Shaikh, see E-Access Bulletin issue 27, March 2002).
</p>
<p> 
 In the coming months three other hardware DAISY book players are
 set to join the Victor Pro on full UK release, and as with this player
 the RNIB aims to ensure they conform to UK safety standards and are
 adequately documented, and will also provide users with ongoing local
 support.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the most eagerly awaited DAISY machines among technology
 buffs is the Japanese-built Plextalk PTR1
 (<a href="http://www.plextalk.org/plextalk_portable.html">http://www.plextalk.org/plextalk_portable.html</a>
), due to go on sale at the end of March. Combining the portability of the Telex and having
 the numeric keypad functions of Victor Pro, the machine also allows
 people to record DAISY books on the move. There has already been
 interest in this device from the BBC, Whittle says, whose radio
 journalists - visually impaired or not - may find its recording and
 indexing useful in the field. The price tag of around 800 pounds means,
 however, the machine is likely to be the preserve of the professional
 and enthusiastic amateur.
</p>
<p> 
 Next to appear will be Visuaide's scaled down Victor Classic
 (<a href="http://www.visuaide.com/victorclassic.html">http://www.visuaide.com/victorclassic.html</a>
), which is expected to come on sale in April following RNIB testing. Unlike the Pro it does
 not have a numeric keypad and is less easily moved, having no integral
 rechargeable battery pack. Priced at around 280 pounds plus VAT it
 hopes to find users, possibly older people, who are happy to sacrifice
 high-sophistication for lower cost and operational simplicity.
</p>
<p> 
 Another lower cost option will be the Telex player
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/telex">http://fastlink.headstar.com/telex</a>
), which will go on sale in May for around 175 pounds. The machine's design is based on the 'clam shell'
 design commonly used for market portable CD players, which will
 make it far more easy to carry around than either the Victor Classic or
 Pro.
