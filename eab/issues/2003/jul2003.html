<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SPONSORED NOTICE:- DISABILITY RIGHTS IN EUROPE: FROM THEORY TO
PRACTICE
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 The UK Disability Rights Commission, with the Department of
 Law and the Centre for Disability Studies at the University of
 Leeds, is pleased to announce a conference to celebrate the
 European Year of Disabled People to be held in Leeds on 25-26
 September 2003.
</p>
<p> 
 The conference will examine legal strategies adopted
 internationally to counter discrimination against disabled people.
 It will also lead to the creation of a network of interested parties
 to develop ongoing work. This event has been accredited with
 eleven 'CPD' (continuing professional development) points by
 the Law Society and the Bar Council.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Secret Action Could Trigger Wave Of Cases.</h3>
<p> 
 A landmark legal action, launched in secret this month against
 companies with web sites that are difficult to access for people with
 visual impairments, could be the trigger for many more cases, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The cases are being brought by the RNIB. Details cannot
 be revealed for legal reasons, although E-Access Bulletin understands
 one of the cases may involve a well-known online shopping site.
</p>
<p> 
 The action is believed to be the first time the Disability
 Discrimination
 Act (DDA - <a href="http://www.disability.gov.uk/dda/">http://www.disability.gov.uk/dda/</a>
) has been used to compile a case against site owners.
</p>
<p> 
 "We could well see a lot more cases like this. It raises the profile of
 web accessibility and many people will realise they have rights and can
 exercise them, instead of just putting up with problems," according to
 a spokesperson for the Disability Rights Commission, which is not
 itself involved in the action.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the commission, although this is the first time the DDA
 has been brought to bear on web sites, settlements will be reached in a
 similar way to other anti-discrimination cases. An initial independent
 assessment is made to identify the problems, followed by negotiations
 to resolve them. Only if negotiations fail will a full court case
 follow.
</p>
<p> 
 "The main objective of this legislation is not to tell people they will
 be
 fined if their sites are inaccessible, but to encourage them to go away
 and change their sites," said solicitor Richard Swinburne. The RNIB
 declined to comment on the cases in detail. A spokesperson said:
 "Cases can halt, reach confidential settlement or be obviated by
 conciliation at any stage and cannot accurately be commented on until
 these processes have been completed."
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: European Procurement Embracesaccessibility.
</h3>
<p> 
 Public sector bodies will need to take into account the needs of
 vision-
 impaired people when awarding contracts for digital services,
 following a European Parliament vote this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The parliament voted to adopt a proposal now set to be included in an
 EU public sector procurement directive by the end of this year
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/europroc">http://fastlink.headstar.com/europroc</a>
). The Council of the European Union, made up of the economic and finance ministers from member
 states, will now consider whether any final amendments are necessary
 before voting on a final draft of the proposal within the next three
 months. If this process runs smoothly it will become part of public
 sector procurement policy across all EU member states by the end of
 2003.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the new directive falls short of obliging public bodies to
 include accessibility in all procurement contracts, they are strongly
 recommended to do so. Specifically, the draft requires of authorities
 that "whenever possible, the contracting authority should take into
 account accessibility criteria for people with disabilities or
 design-for-
 all requirements when laying down specifications".
</p>
<p> 
 According to campaign group European Disability Forum
 (<a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm">http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm</a>
), the new draft carries a significantly stronger commitment to accessibility than existing
 procurement legislation. "Previously, accessibility was included in the
 criteria that could be taken into account when awarding contracts, but
 now authorities will have to provide a good justification if they
 don't,"
 said a spokesperson (see E-Access Bulletin issue 28, April 2002).
</p>
<h3 id="i43-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Harry Potter And The Missing Version.</h3>
<p> 
 The audio-described version of the latest Harry Potter book has been
 delayed, meaning vision-impaired readers will not be able to enjoy this
 publishing phenomenon until the end of September, E-Access Bulletin
 has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 BBC Books has been commissioned by Bloomsbury, the publisher of
 'Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix', to produce the audio
 version on cassette and CD. However it says it has to wait until actor
 Stephen Fry is ready to undertake the reading. "The aim was to get the
 audio version out at the same time [as the book]", a BBC spokesperson
 said. "But Stephen Fry is in the middle of directing a film. The first
 chance he will get to record will be the last two weeks of July."
</p>
<p> 
 The audio version will be available on cassette and CD on 22
 September at a list price of 75 pounds, although according to the BBC
 its own shop and a number of other retailers will be offering discounts
 of 20 to 30 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 Once complete, the RNIB will duplicate the audio version for its
 Talking Books membership scheme
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/talk2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/talk2</a>
), which costs 60 pounds a year to join.
</p>
<p> 
 An RNIB spokeswoman said: "It's very frustrating and
 disadvantageous for people who are blind or visually impaired but this
 situation is by no means unusual - over 90 per cent of books are not
 put into any accessible version."
</p>
<p> 
 Braille translation of the Harry Potter book is already underway, with
 work beginning within two weeks of its general release by the charity
 Scottish Braille Press (<a href="http://www.scottish-braille-press.org">http://www.scottish-braille-press.org</a>
). The charity's general manager John Donaldson said: "Just 5 per cent of
 books are produced in Braille. Harry Potter is a high profile book so
 we decided early on in the year that we would get it out as quickly as
 we could".
</p>
<p> 
 Scottish Braille Press have so far received 70 orders for the book,
 split
 into 16 volumes, at a subsidised price of 12.50 per book. Donaldson
 said there has been a higher demand for it than for any of the previous
 four Harry Potter books.
</p>
<h3 id="i43-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Talking Lampposts For North London.</h3>
<p> 
 A trial that uses talking lampposts to orientate vision-impaired people
 began last week in the London borough of Barnet, and may roll out to
 other parts of the capital if successful.
</p>
<p> 
 The project, entitled 'React', will involve audio guide units fixed to
 26
 lampposts, mostly in the Golders Green area. It was instigated by non-
 profit disability access consultancy JMU
 (<a href="http://www.jmuaccess.org.uk">http://www.jmuaccess.org.uk</a>
), with support from the RNIB and Zurich Financial Services.
</p>
<p> 
 Mark Rose, electronic signs consultant at JMU, said "It's a typical
 London suburb with difficult crossings and junctions. The area has had
 a similar system in place for two years at its bus and train stations."
</p>
<p> 
 Users of the system will carry a matchbox-sized activator, which when
 held in an upright position triggers audible orientation guides
 attached
 to lampposts. Mounted speakers provide information about the location
 of the user when they are eight to nine metres away. Activators, which
 are standardised across the UK, can be obtained for free from the
 RNIB, JMU or Jewish Care Homes.
</p>
<p> 
 "Its a system that tells you where you are," said Rose. "For example,
 it
 tells you what road or crossroads you are on or what bus stop you have
 just got off at. While most vision-impaired users have good local
 knowledge, that is different to knowing where you are at a given time,
 or knowing the distance between places."
</p>
<p> 
 Other UK cities testing the scheme are Leeds - where users can hear
 messages in Hindi, Gujarati or Urdu - Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow
 and York. The projects in Birmingham and Bristol are being funded by
 the local council, while the other areas have drawn funding from a
 variety of sources, including lottery money.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, the scheme could also be used to provide tourist information
 Rose said, although he was unsure whether vision-impaired people
 would still receive the cards for free if this became the case.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: INTERVIEW- HIGHER EDUCATION.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: MAINSTREAMING CHOICEby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 One of the most basic ways of improving access to education for
 people with sensory impairment is the provision of course materials in
 a range of formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The need for such provision has now become a legal imperative in the
 UK, with the introduction of the Special Educational Needs and
 Disability Act 2001 (SENDA - <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/senda1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/senda1</a>
). One higher education institution which is responding positively to the
 new requirements is Kings College London (KCL -
 <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk">http://www.kcl.ac.uk</a>
), where equality and diversity officer Emma Price says accessibility work "is about mainstreaming: getting it into
 people's consciousness".
</p>
<p> 
 At KCL, alternative formats - including Braille, CD, floppy disk,
 internet, large print, cassette, tactile maps and Moon - are offered
 when
 anything is produced for mass distribution among students or staff,
 from departmental prospectuses to leaflets for student healthcare
 provision or classroom handouts.
</p>
<p> 
 To provide guidance and to ensure no student is deprived of any
 information offered by the college, Price has written a policy on
 accessible formats, in line with the college's equal opportunities
 policy
 and current UK legislation.
</p>
<p> 
 Suggestions from staff and students were used in the policy drafting
 process and a volunteer from the employment training programme at
 RNIB's Redhill College (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/redhill">http://fastlink.headstar.com/redhill</a>
) contributed by assessing existing facilities. "I also used the RNIB's
 See
 It Right package (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/see1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/see1</a>
), to help me draft the policy," Price says.
</p>
<p> 
 Throughout the college, departmental disability liaison officers were
 given specific training by Price and her team and by SKILL: the
 National Bureau for Students With Disabilities
 (<a href="http://www.skill.org.uk">http://www.skill.org.uk</a>
) They then advise students on specific subject areas and specific disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 As to which formats are requested the most, she says: "Disk and
 internet are the most popular, it is really going that way - the
 majority
 of students use email. Lots of work is uploaded onto the internet to
 update departmental pages. We have not had one request for Braille".
</p>
<p> 
 Some formats cause particular problems. "Attachments are hard to read
 with assistive software. For example, portable document format (pdf)
 files need to have a Word or plain text alternative," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 To solve this problem, the policy says a web link should be provided
 with any pdf, linking it to Access Adobe, a programme that translates
 pdf files to html or text versions which can then be read using
 assistive
 software. "I had a meeting with the director of web services about
 accessibility and they are now feeding it into their training," she
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 The policy is not just about technology: style is an issue for
 accessibility too. "Clearly written and printed materials are valuable
 for all," Price says. Accordingly, the policy states: "Accessibility of
 information should always be borne in mind, not only for disabled
 students but also for the wider community."
</p>
<p> 
 What targets do Price and her team have now? "It's very difficult to
 ensure 100 per cent of staff are aware of the issues, but for the short
 to
 medium term it would be wonderful to have every access request
 responded to quickly," she says. "We need more talk in this area, more
 staff training and more awareness".
</p>
<p> 
 What about other institutions - are they set to follow suit?
 Alarmingly,
 Price has noted a lack of enthusiasm from other institutions'
 disability
 departments. "I sent an email to an online discussion forum recently
 but the only kind of response I got was 'yes, it's an issue for us
 too.' I
 was surprised only three people came back to me - for us, it was
 something we just had to do".
</p>
<p> 
 The perceived high cost of accessibility work is likely to be the
 sticking point for many, she says. "In many institutions the initial
 gripes are usually 'how much will it cost?' but there is now a business
 case as well as a moral and a legal case for it".
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, Price says the crux of good accessible format provision is
 to include its planning early in the publication process. "For example,
 if the School of Medicine produces a handbook, it's important to work
 transcription services into the strategy at the planning stages."
</p>
<p> 
 A Catch-22 situation can arise however where some people say they'll
 only take action on accessibility if they receive a request for it, but
 if
 information is not available in accessible formats then people will not
 request it or know that it can be made available, she says.
</p>
<p> 
 "The more requests received, the more people realise we must provide
 accessible formats. But unless you say you produce alternative formats,
 no-one comes forward."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: NO ALTERNATIVE TO ACCESSIBLE SITES.by Dan Jellinek  <a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a>

<p> 
 Web site accessibility was the hottest topic for debate on this year's

 IT managers' body Socitm (<a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk">http://www.socitm.gov.uk</a>

 Accessibility refers to the ease with which all types of user,

 people with disabilities such as vision impairment, can access the
 information on a web site. Many local authorities and other public
 bodies offer a text-only version of their web sites as these are
 considered more accessible for example to text-to-speech screen
 readers: but most participants in the online debate said such a
 strategy
 was misguided.
</p>
<p> 
 Martin Bottomley of Dorset County Council said: "I continue to be
 amazed that virtually every local government website has a text-only
 alternative, in spite of the fact that this is not best practice.
</p>
<p> 
 "In fact, there should be one graphical version of a site that meets a
 minimum of the international WAI accessibility standard
 (<a href="http://www.w3c.org/wai">http://www.w3c.org/wai</a>
), to 'priority 1' level. This is because people with disabilities dislike being given special provision, and text-only
 sites are unnecessary if the graphical site is accessible. It also
 follows
 central government guidelines, which state: "alternative text-only
 pages should rarely be necessary and are not best practice"; and "the
 challenge to your web developers has to be in creating web pages that
 are both visually appealing and fully accessible to a wide range of
 users" (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/oee2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/oee2</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 "Another reason not to use text-only sites is that there is a very real
 possibility of creating a separate but inferior site for some groups of
 people, to a much greater extent than their needs. For example, 90 per
 cent of people who are registered as blind have some vision. Their
 needs may well be better met by using a graphical version with
 increased font size, where the text is supported by graphics, rather
 than
 just plain text."
</p>
<p> 
 Chris Swaine, webmaster at Reading-city.net, said: "One huge problem
 is that many council members and officers - even those responsible for
 council websites - know very little about e-government, and they know
 even less on the issues surrounding accessible websites.
</p>
<p> 
 "I find this extremely frustrating as a member trying to educate both
 colleagues and officers. I have also not been particularly impressed
 with the many content management software solutions and companies
 who demonstrate their extremely expensive options, yet who are not
 genuinely interested in creating truly accessible websites, and
 templates that meet basic accessibility standards, which is not
 particularly hard.
</p>
<p> 
  "As a professional, involved in accessibility issues with the UK
 online
 movement, I would like to see solutions that integrate full
 accessibility
 as a norm, without people thinking of it as an add-on."
</p>
<p> 
 Mary Ann Hooper, adult care services web site project manager at
 Herts County Council said: "I think much more work is needed to
 ensure that website designers, providers, and users understand what
 accessibility means. There seems to be an assumption that it is about
 blind users, which it is of course, but they are only one group which
 need website design to be accessible. It is also needed for a very wide
 range of users, such as those with old browsers, those who can't
 physically use a mouse, or those who need large or different-coloured
 text, and many more. Universal accessibility is what we should be
 aiming to achieve."
</p>
<p> 
 Steve Crossan of open source programmers Runtime Collective said:
 "The only way to really make it work is to have a representative group
 of users involved throughout the process, preferably sitting down with
 the designers as much as possible. This doesn't have to be large -
 three
 to five people works well - and in the context of most e-government
 budgets it does not have to be expensive. It should represent a range
 of
 potential users. On top of that you can use an accessibility
 consultancy
 where appropriate - at the very least get a screen reader and put all
 your designs through it.
</p>
<p> 
 "And here's my number one top tip for accessibility from experience
 which is very cheap to implement: big text."
