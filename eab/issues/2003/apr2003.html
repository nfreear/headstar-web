<h3 id="i40-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: 'Thin Client' Accessibility Breakthrough.</h3>
<p> 
 A breakthrough in screen reader technology could soon allow vision
 impaired people to access 'thin client'
 computer terminals, the low-memory networked machines which until now
 have proved incompatible with
 special access technologies, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Many large organisations are installing 'thin client' networks, where
 almost all information and software
 applications sits on a central server. The 'thin' machines on users'
 desktops are little more than keyboards
 and screens, which call out information and software as needed,
 enhancing security and cutting costs.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the majority of access technology software relies on a fully
 functioning desktop computer and will
 not function on a 'thin client' terminal. This led the RNIB to warn
 last year the phenomenon was in danger of
 setting the cause of accessibility back ten to 15 years (see E-Access
 Bulletin, issue 37, January 2003).
</p>
<p> 
 The breakthrough happened at a meeting between assistive technology
 developer GW Micro and
 representatives of the RNIB at the March international access
 technology conference 'CSUN'
 (<a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf</a>
). At the meeting, GW Micro was able to demonstrate a fully functioning
 prototype of its Window-Eyes screen reader on a computer terminal
 running thin client software from Citrix,
 E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is a significant development. There was no glimpse of a screen
 reader that was compatible with this
 technology before CSUN," said Ruth Loebl of the RNIB technology
 department. According to Loebl, other
 assistive technology developers such as Freedom Scientific, maker of
 the popular JAWS screen reader, are
 also working on products which are compatible with thin client
 networks. "We're still some way from
 products coming onto the market, but this demonstration is important
 because it shows that the problems can
 be solved," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 UK access software specialist Dolphin Oceanic has also confirmed to
 E-Access Bulletin it has developed a
 working prototype of a thin-client compatible screen reader. And Loebl
 says Microsoft is thought to be
 developing accessible thin client server software, "but it's more
 difficult to assess progress because its
 developers are tied into non-disclosure agreements," said Loebl.
</p>
<h3 id="i40-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Flaws Detected In 'Driving Licence' Test.</h3>
<p> 
 Standard systems for training and examining people for the European
 Computer Driving Licence (ECDL -
 <a href="http://www.ecdl.co.uk">http://www.ecdl.co.uk</a>
), an international test of computer literacy, have design flaws that could disadvantage
 vision impaired users, according to the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The licence (<a href="http://www.ecdl.co.uk">http://www.ecdl.co.uk</a>
) is a UK version of a European training standard managed by the British
 Computer Society (BCS), consisting of seven online learning modules on
 computer basics such as use of
 word processing and spreadsheets. It is rapidly being adopted by large
 organisations from IBM to the
 National Health Service as a minimum standard of IT competence. Tests
 can be partially automated, making
 it easy to use on a large scale.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB and other organisations that work with blind people last month
 met with representatives of the
 BCS and companies that deliver local training, to identify potential
 problems with the system.
</p>
<p> 
 "So far we've been getting mixed messages, with some blind people
 saying they have completed ECDL, and
 others saying that parts are not accessible," Zoe Neumann of the RNIB
 Technology unit told E-Access
 Bulletin. "It needs to be crystal clear where the sticking points are,
 so that we can do something about it".
</p>
<p> 
 Early feedback suggests that parts of the training and examination
 assume that the trainee can use a mouse
 unaided, Neumann said. Concern has also been expressed about some of
 the formats used for training, such
 as PowerPoint. "Some ECDL tests ask the user to change the background
 colour on the screen. Using only a
 keyboard, this can be very difficult in PowerPoint," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Vision impaired readers who have taken an ECDL course are invited
 to contact E-Access Bulletin
 with their experiences. Please email <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i40-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Disability Commission To Survey The Web.</h3>
<p> 
 The Disability Rights Commission (DRC - <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
) is to conduct a survey of web site
 accessibility across England, Scotland and Wales, analysing the causes
 of difficulties and recommending
 ways to make the web more inclusive.
</p>
<p> 
 The investigation will survey the web sites of 1,000 randomly selected
 organisations in both the public and
 private sectors, testing for compliance with industry accessibility
 standards as laid down in the international
 Web Accessibility Initiative (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
). In addition, a panel of 50 disabled people will take
 part in more in-depth testing of a sample of these sites. The
 commission will work in collaboration with a
 team from the Centre for Human Computer Interaction Design at City
 University London (<a href="http://www-">http://www-</a>

 hcid.soi.city.ac.uk), led by Professor Helen Petrie.
</p>
<p> 
 The project aims to report by the end of 2003, although it will not
 identify particular organisations as
 examples of good or bad design. "The reason we're conducting this
 investigation is because generally, we
 suspect that standards of accessibility are quite low, but this is not
 about naming and shaming," a DRC
 spokesperson said.
</p>
<h3 id="i40-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Equality Resource For Universities.</h3>
<p> 
 A new online resource for UK colleges and universities to ensure equal
 opportunities for all their staff with
 disabilities has been launched by the Equality Challenge Unit, a body
 sponsored by the UK higher education
 funding and representative bodies to promote equal opportunities.
</p>
<p> 
 The site (<a href="http://www.ecu.ac.uk">http://www.ecu.ac.uk</a>
) combines policy advice with good practice recommendations designed to
 combat discrimination of all kinds and foster diversity in the higher
 education sector. It also draws together
 legal resources such as the parts of the Disability Discrimination Act
 dealing with employment and
 education (<a href="http://www.ecu.ac.uk/disability">http://www.ecu.ac.uk/disability</a>
), codes of practice from the Disability Rights Commission
 (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/campaign/law/code.asp">http://www.drc-gb.org/campaign/law/code.asp</a>
), and useful sources of technology information such as the
 accessible technology in education agency Techdis
 (<a href="http://www.techdis.ac.uk">http://www.techdis.ac.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
  "This is a significant area of employment - around 345,000 people in
 the UK are employed in higher
 education," an ECU spokesperson said.
</p>
<p> 
 Separately, disability campaign group Skill (<a href="http://www.skill.org.uk">http://www.skill.org.uk</a>
) has called on the government to revise
 proposals for the new Office for Fair Access, a body that will promote
 greater access to colleges and
 universities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. "The
 proposals make no mention of disabled
 students," Skill said last week.
</p>
<h3 id="i40-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Cynthia Says.</h3>
<p> 
 An new international group which aims to help addressing the internet
 needs of people with special needs
 has launched a new free service to evaluate web page accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The Internet Society Disability and Special Needs chapter
 (<a href="http://www.isocdisab.org">http://www.isocdisab.org</a>
) is the first ever non- geographical chapter of the society, a free membership organisation
 comprised of 11,000 individual and
 institutional members from 182 countries.
</p>
<p> 
 Together with technology company HiSoftware and the International
 Center for Disability Resources on the
 Internet (<a href="http://www.icdri.org">http://www.icdri.org</a>
), the chapter has helped develop Cynthia Says (<a href="http://www.cynthiasays.com">http://www.cynthiasays.com</a>
), an online web accessibility test similar to the well-known software
 Bobby (<a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com">http://bobby.watchfire.com</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The chapter is currently inviting people to contribute to forthcoming
 projects which include the creation of a
 member newsletter and the identification of issues it ought to address.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i40-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: CORRECT REFERENCE:</h3>
<p>  Trevor Frost, Adaptive Technology Coordinator at the Royal Society for
 the Blind of South Australia, appears to have captured the mood in our
 last issue when he noted that the
 phrase 'visually impaired' is not as accurate as 'vision impaired' -
 the term more commonly used in Australia
 - since it is a person's vision that is affected, not their appearance.
</p>
<p> 
 Annette Peter agrees: "As a 'blind' person, happy to be described by
 that term as people understand what it
 means, I was interested to read Mr Frost's item. I must agree with him
 that 'visually impaired' is not a
 correct term, and is one that I have never been particularly
 comfortable with. 'Vision impaired' is a much
 more correct term and I would like to see it adopted in this country."
</p>
<p> 
 Robin Christopherson, web consultancy manager at the charity
 Abilitynet, also concurs: "Trevor's
 observation that the term 'visually impaired' means that the person is
 unattractive to look at was indeed
 greeted by great mirth by myself as predicted. I am a UK resident.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'd never thought of it before but now it's obvious that 'vision
 impaired' is a better term. I'd better get
 started on changing the many dozen references that exist within
 AbilityNet's website and our numerous
 factsheets on technology for disabled individuals."
</p>
<h3 id="i40-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: RECTANGULAR REPONSE:</h3>
<p>  Last month John Loader wrote in on behalf of his mother-in-law to
 enquire if anyone knew of software which could change a computer cursor
 into a big black rectangle.
</p>
<p> 
 Terry Balon replied: "Further to the enquiry about large cursors I have
 purchased the Valerix MetaMouse
 Cursor set and found it absolutely brilliant for the needs of my
 family. We are able to change the colour of
 the cursor, give it an edge and so on to each of our individual needs
 without too much trouble. You can
 download a free demo version or purchase from various sites including
 <a href="http://www.regsoft.com">http://www.regsoft.com</a>
 ."</p>
<p> 
 Robin Christopherson adds: "Windows ME and Windows XP have a feature in
 the 'Accessibility' option
 (Start menu/Settings/Control Panel) to do this. Go to the 'Display'
 page of this dialog box and there is a
 slider to adjust the width of the flashing cursor.
</p>
<p> 
 "Unfortunately, however, the change is not universal. You get the fat
 cursor in Notepad and all areas of
 Windows where you can type text (such as the 'Find Files and Folders'
 dialog box) but not in WordPad or,
 more importantly, Microsoft Word.
</p>
<p> 
 "For a fat cursor in Word the only option I know of is to use a little
 program called "follow.exe" (which
 AbilityNet can send out free of charge) that locks the mouse cursor to
 the flashing cursor. You can still
 move the mouse to free it, but when the cursor moves again it jumps
 back and follows along. When the
 mouse pointer is over the document window it is still a slim line, but
 you can easily redefine it for something
 really high-visibility like a big black arrow.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: INTERVIEW- JAKOB NIELSEN.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: A FAT LOT OF USABILITY?by Dan Jellinek  <a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 One of the world's leading champions of web usability, Jakob Nielsen,
 was in the UK last month to run a
 week-long series of seminars. He took time out to talk to E-Access
 Bulletin about the connections between
 usability and accessibility, and the poor track record of government
 sites in particular in meeting user needs.
</p>
<p> 
 Nielsen says the field of usability - how easy it is for a user to find
 information on a site or carry out a
 transaction - overlaps in many areas with that of accessibility - the
 ease with which people with different
 needs or using special access devices can gain access to the
 information on your site.
</p>
<p> 
 "Often accessibility is viewed as totally divorced from usability, but
 actually how you present information is
 just as important for accessibility as merely being able to get at it.
 Even if a web site is accessible according
 to the various technical standards, and for example is able to be read
 aloud by a screen reader, if there are
 endless lists of menu options usability will be heavily impaired."
</p>
<p> 
 Both usability and accessibility are assessed in the same way, by
 testing against real human needs, he says.
 And both cover not only use by people with disabilities, but also
 people with different levels of education or
 computer skills, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Nielsen (<a href="http://www.useit.com/jakob">http://www.useit.com/jakob</a>
) is principal of the user-centred design consultancy Nielsen Norman
 Group (NN/g - <a href="http://www.nngroup.com">http://www.nngroup.com</a>
) which he co-founded with Donald Norman, former vice president
 of research at Apple Computer. Before that he was a senior engineer
 with Sun Microsystems, helping the
 company establish its first web services.
</p>
<p> 
 NN/g has carried out extensive testing of government sites in the US
 and Australia, and Nielsen says that his
 own informal reviews of public service sites in other countries
 including the UK has shown that the lessons
 to be learned are universal.
</p>
<p> 
 "Government sites are very patchy. You come across a few good ones from
 time to time, but they are not
 nearly as good as they should be," he says. "They are usually among the
 lowest scorers in our usability
 tests."
</p>
<p> 
 The most common failing for public sector sites is that they are
 focused too closely on their own internal
 departmental structures and initiatives, or their current work
 programmes, and not on what information the
 user is actually likely to be seeking, Nielsen says.
</p>
<p> 
 "This shows a bureaucratic way of thinking. You see it a little bit on
 company sites, but it is predominant on
 government sites."
</p>
<p> 
 He said government agencies may find it hard to see the need to spend
 money on boosting usability, as they
 do not make the same 'return on investment' judgments as companies.
 "But the fact is that better usability
 leads to increased satisfaction for the citizen, which to me is the
 reason we have government in the first
 place."
</p>
<p> 
 In fact, government agencies have even more need to consider usability
 than companies, he said. "For
 commercial sites, you can make a trade-off and decide to reach a few
 customers where you can make the
 most money. But for government you can't say that, you can't decide to
 only serve a part of the population."
</p>
<p> 
 Nielsen's company is one of the pioneers of controlled user testing of
 web sites, which he argues is the only
 way to properly gauge a site's usability. A group of ordinary users are
 observed attempting to perform tasks
 on the web, such as find a tax form or a bus route. "It's so common
 that people can't find what they are
 looking for - it's tragic. And the government agencies that call us in
 are the ones who are bothered about
 usability. The average agency won't bother looking at it at all."
</p>
<p> 
 Nielsen says one example of a US government site that is highly usable
 is 'Ready.gov'
 (<a href="http://www.ready.gov">http://www.ready.gov</a>
), the Department of Homeland Security's site with public information about how to
 prepare for and respond to various forms of terrorist attack.
</p>
<p> 
 "The site explains what to do in clear and simple terms. But it is a
 new project, so it was easier to build in
 usability."
</p>
<p> 
 In the US, the requirement for accessibility standards to be built into
 all government technology contracts set
 out in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
 (<a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
) had increased awareness of the issues, he said. But progress is slow, since it mainly affected new
 projects. "Section 508 boosted interest in
 accessibility, but in practice not many sites have been affected. The
 major departments have spent a very
 long time implementing it."
</p>
<p> 
 As for the precise costs of making a web site more usable and
 accessible, Nielsen said that it was possible to
 spend a lot of money, and it was right for large organisations with
 public-facing sites such as the NHS to do
 so, but it was also possible to make at least some progress for a small
 outlay.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is no such thing as the perfect user interface, a site that is
 equally usable by everybody. And it would
 be very expensive to come close to such a site. But people should not
 think that there is a binary choice
 between a horrible web site and a perfect one. No matter what the
 budget, you can always take a site and
 make improvements. Within three days you can do some testing and draw
 up a list of the top ten things you
 need to do to improve usability. You should attack the biggest
 stumbling blocks first."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: OPINION- GOVERNMENT POLICY.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: OUT OF FOCUSby Kevin Carey  <a href="mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 At the beginning of the year I drafted a paper which called for policy
 on accessibility to be concentrated in
 one place within the UK and in Europe.
</p>
<p> 
 The paper argued that in the EU, accessibility should be the
 responsibility of the Information Society
 Directorate, and in the UK it should be co-ordinated by the Office of
 the e-Envoy (OeE - <a href="http://www.e-">http://www.e-</a>

 envoy.gov.uk), the cross-government technology policy and
 implementation body based in the Cabinet
 Office.
</p>
<p> 
 I still have a chance with the first objective, but I am having to
 rewrite the paper's UK section because the
 OeE has just lost about a quarter of its budget and, I would guess,
 three-quarters of its importance in co-
 ordinating functions.
</p>
<p> 
 This leaves us in the awkward position of fighting to save something we
 don't love very much, but the fact is
 that the OeE is the best mechanism we have. In the UK, there is simply
 nowhere else to go. We might try the
 Disability Rights Commission which, better late than never, has just
 become interested in web accessibility
 (see news, this issue); or we might place all our hopes in the new
 broadcasting and telecommunications
 regulator 'Ofcom' (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">http://www.ofcom.org.uk</a>
). But when it comes to getting the government to obey its own
 accessibility regulations, the best mechanism is a body such as the
 e-Envoy's office which is acknowledged
 as interdepartmental.
</p>
<p> 
 What we don't want is a situation where the four separate government
 departments with the biggest interest
 in technology policy - the Department for Education and Science, the
 Department for Work and Pensions,
 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade
 and Industry - are fighting so
 hard for the honour of co-ordinating disability access so that they
 don't have time to actually implement
 anything.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile over the past five years the accessibility lobby has not been
 doing at all well on broadcasting.
 The EU (as reported in the last issue of E-Access Bulletin) is in the
 last lap of legislation on digital TV and
 broad band access and the draft bill doesn't even mention disability
 access. Nor does the UK's
 Communications Bill which is almost through Parliament.
</p>
<p> 
 To some extent, from the mighty pinnacle of the UK's e-Envoy himself
 Andrew Pinder down to the
 humblest charity policy officer, we have all made the same mistake. We
 have been travelling into the future
 with our backs to the engine, concentrating in the information age on
 the computer and not on the
 information industry which is driven by broadcasting and will be
 supplied through the telephone. Thus,
 while we have been worrying purely about web site accessibility,
 broadcasting, telecommunications and
 their user interfaces have been steadily deregulated as the result of
 globalisation.
</p>
<p> 
 The reality at the political level is that there isn't much the OeE can
 do in a dog fight with the DTI and, it is
 becoming increasingly clear, there isn't much the OeE can do across
 government because there are two many
 departmental interests getting in the way. This is not surprising. When
 we call for joined up government, we
 forget for example that the NHS, as the biggest corporate entity in the
 UK, has enough problems getting
 itself a common technology policy, let alone one which also fits the
 DfES, itself the size of the HSBC
 banking group.
</p>
<p> 
 So it looks like the OeE will soon sail into the technological sunset:
 an entity that came too late, did too little
 and left too soon. Meanwhile, we need to cast about for another
 centralising entity. It may have to be the
 Disability Rights Commission, but the problem is that even this body
 will soon be rolled up with the Equal
 Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality into a
 generic equality commission.
</p>
<p> 
 It may be that the major disability non-governmental organisations
 (NGOs) will have to get together and
 start their own small but supercharged agency. The problem with that
 course is that it will have to have
 autonomy and NGOs that spend most of their time squabbling are not very
 good at empowering what they
 perceive may turn into a rival. But we haven't much time for paperwork
 on this issue: it just needs to be
 done.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FIVE: VIEWPOINT- CAREER PATHS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: STEPPING AHEADby Nolan Crabb  <a href="mailto:ncra@teleport.com">ncra@teleport.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 There is an ancient Chinese proverb which says: "A journey of a
 thousand miles must begin with a single
 step."
</p>
<p> 
 For me, the journey to a writing career began in high school with a
 single raised hand. During journalism
 class, I volunteered to write the weekly school activities column for
 the Ogden Standard-Examiner, the daily
 paper in Ogden, Utah where I grew up. That column ultimately led to a
 summer internship with the paper
 during college and then to my first job as a reporter.
</p>
<p> 
 Since then, I've held a variety of writing jobs in various cities
 around the country. For a brief time, I
 abandoned writing altogether to teach technology. So how does one
 manage a career that includes so many
 twists and turns?
</p>
<p> 
 The first important point to make is that, as a blind or vision
 impaired person taking your own thousand-mile
 journey, don't be afraid to take risks and follow your hunches. I've
 had seven jobs and lived in every time
 zone in the US since 1982. Many would say that such a lifestyle is
 unstable or problematic, but I saw those
 job changes as new opportunities that would allow me to better my life,
 and that of my family.
</p>
<p> 
 Every move had its attendant risks. In 1986, I moved from Chicago to
 the Bay Area of northern California.
 I'd learned of a job with a small company that produced newsletters for
 various businesses. I used what
 meagre savings I had to pay for my plane ticket to California for the
 interview. Foolish? Perhaps. But at the
 end of the day, I had a job offer, and suddenly my apparent foolishness
 paid off.
</p>
<p> 
 I don't recommend that everyone live their lives as nomadically as I
 have. But after you've researched the
 job you want, you may have to risk moving to a bigger city to secure
 that job. Comfort zones are wonderful
 places, but they can be stifling, too. The alternative to taking a risk
 could be growing old and bitter,
 obsessing about jobs that might have been.
</p>
<p> 
 Its important to plan for the possibilities in attending an interview.
 It's not enough to just badly want to
 work. At the last minute, as I was leaving my home for that job
 interview in California, I grabbed my
 Optacon - a device that allows blind people to read printed material -
 flung it into my bag, and headed for
 the airport.
</p>
<p> 
 During the interview, the company's chief executive said he expected me
 to take a writing test. He gave me
 two pages of notes on a real estate deal. "Take these and turn them
 into a hot news story," he said. "I've
 another interview to do; I don't have time to sit and read you these
 notes. I guess I can find a staff person to
 do this, but . . ." I interrupted and assured him that as long as those
 notes weren't hand-written, I could
 handle them fine. I was glad I had my Optacon with me.
</p>
<p> 
 I'm not suggesting you can plan for every possibility. But you can take
 an active part in your interview by
 thinking about answers in advance to questions you're sure you'll be
 asked. Better yet, think about how to
 openly present, from your perspective, some of the concerns that the
 interviewer may hesitate bringing up.
</p>
<p> 
 Immerse yourself in your chosen career. I don't mean spend all hours at
 the office, abandoning family and
 all other vestiges of life. I mean immerse yourself in the industry's
 publications; learn its buzzwords; learn
 something about the players in that industry; by immersing yourself in
 the literature of your field, you're
 better prepared to change the way you do things so you won't become a
 burdensome dinosaur.
</p>
<p> 
 Reading trade magazines in your field is a great way to learn about job
 openings. If you're just browsing the
 newspaper or even internet job boards, you're probably missing some
 great opportunities that are announced
 in trade publications. The advent of the internet makes such magazines
 even easier to read.
</p>
<p> 
 Technology is good, but attitude and technology are better. There's no
 question that getting and retaining a
 job depends a lot on the technology you can use and how easy it is to
 get at that technology.
</p>
<p> 
 My first experience with computers at a newspaper came in 1977 while in
 college. Those computers didn't
 talk, and there was no Braille display. I had to memorise long
 keystroke sequences to file a story with the
 editorial desk. But as my jobs changed, so did my ability to use
 technology.
</p>
<p> 
 For years, I feared making the jump from DOS to Windows. At the time I
 was contemplating making that
 jump I was working for the American Council of the Blind, where LeRoy
 Saunders was president. I
 expressed my concerns to him and, in that straightforward way that was
 his trademark, he said with a smile:
 "It's not the technology that's the problem, it's your attitude."  His
 point was well taken. By January 1997, I
 was using Windows with a screen reader.
</p>
<p> 
 So if you're looking for the right career or to change jobs, you can
 start by taking small steps. For me, it all
 began with something as simple as a raised hand - that single step on
 the way to a fruitful and enjoyable
 career.
