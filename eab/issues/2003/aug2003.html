<h3 id="i44-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Assistive Technology Users 'Poorly Served'.</h3>
<p> 
 Many assistive technology products for people with vision impairment,
 such as screen-readers, are unreliable and do not serve their users
 well, the leader of the UK's largest ever web site accessibility
 investigation said last week.
</p>
<p> 
 Helen Petrie, professor of human computer interaction at City
 University London, is heading the major web research project on
 behalf of the Disability Rights Commission, managing a team of testers
 using a range of assistive products. "I was very struck by how poorly
 served people are by their assistive technology," she said at a
 progress briefing.
</p>
<p> 
 Assistive technology products are also often too complicated for users'
 needs, and cause computers to crash too often, Petrie said. "They are
 not as stable as one would hope."
</p>
<p> 
 Vision impaired testers have found filling in online forms using a
 screen reader particularly tough, she said. "Too much concentration is
 going on their assistive technology and not on the task they are trying
 to do."
</p>
<p> 
 At focus group meetings held as part of the research programmes, a
 long discussion was held about the problems brought about by assistive
 technologies, Petrie said. She said she was "shocked" by the responses
 when users were asked how the technologies were working.
</p>
<p> 
 "I think we'll make recommendations for people that work with
 assistive technology to make a range of systems ranging from simple to
 complex for people to access the web," Petrie said.
</p>
<p> 
 Project manager Steven Beesley, from the DRC, said he would be
 happy to put pressure on assistive technology providers to improve
 their products. Full findings of the research will be published at the
 end of the year.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="i44-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessible Procurement Plans On Hold.</h3>
<p> 
 An attempt to develop disability-friendly software development rules
 for all large organisations could be stymied unless the RNIB finds a
 partner willing to take it beyond the concept phase, E-Access Bulletin
 has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Most large organisations commission the development of significant
 amounts of new or tailored software to assist aspects of their work or
 internal efficiency. The charity wants to ensure as much as possible of
 such activity is accessible by developing a standard policy which any
 organisation could adapt.
</p>
<p> 
 It will start by looking at its own software procurement practice, but
 is keen to sign up a partner to help develop the policy and ensure it is
 widely applicable.
</p>
<p> 
 "We need a large government department or a large employer," says
 the project's manager Ruth Loebl. "If partnerships are not formed,
 there will be a risk that many organisations create their own
 guidelines
 independently, which will mean that software developers will have to
 apply different criteria for different customers. This can only devalue
 the issues, and increase the cost of software. The seeming inability of
 customers to agree on what comprises accessibility would surely
 undermine the principles we are trying to promote."
</p>
<p> 
 However Loebl said that so far, only verbal support has been gained
 from three potential partners: the Department for Work and Pensions,
 the Office of the e-Envoy, and the Employers Forum
 (<a href="http://www.employers-forum.co.uk">http://www.employers-forum.co.uk</a>
). Other organisations that might make good potential partners include the BBC and high street financial
 institutions, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB's thinking about software procurement is set out in an
 unpublished paper seen by E-Access Bulletin which suggests that
 accessibility rules should come in two parts: a concise set of legal
 standards and a lengthier code of practice. Failure to incorporate
 accessibility into procurement is likely to breach the Disability
 Discrimination Act, it warns.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB drew on three existing resources in drawing up its
 proposals, a checklist for accessible software drawn up by IBM
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ibm1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ibm1</a>
); section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act (<a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
); and the Irish National Disability Authority guidelines
 (<a href="http://www.accessit.nda.ie/guidelineindex_4.html">http://www.accessit.nda.ie/guidelineindex_4.html</a>
). To ensure the policy is sensitive to the broadest range of disabilities the paper has
 been sent to the charities Mencap, Scope, the RNID, the British
 Dyslexic Association, and AbilityNet for comment.
</p>
<h3 id="i44-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Colleges Slow To Take Up Free Software Offer.</h3>
<p> 
 Only a third of UK colleges and universities have taken up an offer of
 free software to test the accessibility of their websites, according to
 EduServ (<a href="http://www.eduserv.ac.uk">http://www.eduserv.ac.uk</a>
), the national education technology charity which has launched the new scheme.
</p>
<p> 
 Under a bulk licensing agreement negotiated by EduServ, all 750 UK
 colleges and universities have been granted free use of the 'LIFT'
 series of accessibility products developed by US firm UsableNet (see
 <a href="http://www.usablenet.com/products_services">http://www.usablenet.com/products_services</a>
). The products help designers and publishers make the content and navigation features of
 their web sites more accessible to people with visual impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 Under the scheme institutions may use versions of LIFT which work
 with the web site development software packages Dreamweaver and
 FrontPage, or LIFT Online
 (<a href="http://www.usablenet.com/frontend/demoform.jsp">http://www.usablenet.com/frontend/demoform.jsp</a>
). Each institution will pay a preferential rate for use of more than one product, and
 could save up to 8,000 pounds each on licence fees, which would add up to
 millions of pounds in all.
</p>
<p> 
 "So far, around 200 licences have been taken up, and we're anxious for
 more people to take up this opportunity," said Stephen Butcher of
 EduServ. "We ran several workshops before the summer break and it
 appears there is great variation in awareness of this issue."
</p>
<p> 
 There is increased pressure on colleges and universities to improve the
 accessibility of their web sites because the Special Educational Needs
 and Disability Act (SENDA - <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/senda1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/senda1</a>
) comes into force this autumn, setting new standards for study aids.
</p>
<p> 
 A good response to the LIFT initiative could mean that other tester
 products are included in the EduServ scheme. According to recent
 research it is advisable to test web sites using a combination of
 products, rather than relying on a single solution such as LIFT (see E-
 Access Bulletin, issue 42, June 2003).
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Mobile Speech Showdown Set For Autumn.</h3>
<p> 
 This autumn the two main contenders in the field of mobile phone
 speech software - Mobile Accessibility and TALKS - will step up their
 competition with new products for a wider range of phones and
 portable digital assistants (PDAs).
</p>
<p> 
 The Spanish-developed software Mobile Accessibility
 (<a href="http://www.mobileaccessibility.com">http://www.mobileaccessibility.com</a>
) currently runs on Nokia phones using the Symbian series 60 operating system. The application -
 developed by the firm Code Factory in partnership with the Spanish
 national blindness charity ONCE - allows various features of the phone
 to be spoken aloud including text messages, a contact book, alarms and
 a battery and signal strength monitor.
</p>
<p> 
 This autumn Mobile Accessibility is set to expand to four other
 platforms including the SPV smartphone which uses Microsoft
 Windows.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile the German system TALKS (formerly TALX - see
 <a href="http://www.talx.de/index_e.htm">http://www.talx.de/index_e.htm</a>
) - came to the UK in January when Vodafone UK and the RNIB launched a 'speaking phone' based on the
 Nokia 9210i Communicator - a mobile phone/PDA hybrid (see E-
 Access Bulletin, issue 36, December 2002). TALKS is a screen-reader
 which allows speech output of everything shown on the display of a
 mobile device.
</p>
<p> 
 TALKS is set to take on Mobile Accessibility directly in September
 when it releases a screen-reader for phones which use the Symbian
 series 60 operating system. According to a TALKS spokesperson the
 new system will cost around 150 pounds, just 20 pounds more than the
 Mobile Accessibility application.
</p>
<p> 
 TALKS says its screen reader product offers more flexibility than the
 Mobile Accessibility solutions, giving access to all the hundreds of
 applications developed for the new phones. Mobile Accessibility,
 meanwhile, said it was ready to consolidate its lead in the series 60
 market, launching an updated version before the end of the year along
 with Danish, Dutch and Norwegian speaking versions.

</p>
<p> 
 Allan Thomas, a technician at Clarity Transcription Services in Hull,
 responds: "I'm not sure about software or hardware devices that will
 scan the internet for radio stations. However, you might want to take a
 closer look at web sites dedicated to internet radio stations such as
 Mike's Radio World (<a href="http://www.mikesradioworld.com">http://www.mikesradioworld.com</a>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: RESEARCH- WEB ACCESS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: SPEAK NO EVILby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 "If you're hoping to hear lots of exciting results, I'm afraid you're
 going to be disappointed - we want to identify bad practice, not bad
 practitioners."
</p>
<p> 
 Such was the news from Helen Petrie, professor of Human Computer
 Interaction at City University's School of Informatics, (<a href="http://www-">http://www-</a>

 hcid.soi.city.ac.uk), at a briefing last week on her team's ongoing
 investigation into web site accessibility on behalf of the Disability
 Rights Commission (DRC- <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The investigation, described by Petrie as having now reached 'halfway
 house', is entitled "an in-depth study of the current state of web site
 accessibility in Britain". It will survey the web sites of 1,000
 randomly selected organisations in both the public and private sectors, testing
 for compliance with accessibility standards. In addition, a panel of 50
 disabled people will take part in more in-depth testing of a sample of
 these sites (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 40, April 2003).
</p>
<p> 
 As Petrie was keen to stress, the project's final report will not name
 poor sites. Instead it hopes to increase awareness of web accessibility
 by detailing cases of good practice and creating resources to help
 organisations to measure the accessibility of their site. However, the
 intention is not to create a new set of standards or a new standards
 body, Petrie said.
</p>
<p> 
 Project manager Steven Beesley from the DRC said: "We want to work
 with people. We'd like to help, advise and conciliate rather than wade
 in with big boots."
</p>
<p> 
 As an initial part of the work, a group of unnamed firms were given a
 questionnaire with a scale rating for various questions about
 accessibility. The question "How interested is your company in web
 accessibility?" gave rise to particularly disappointing results, with a
 low response rate, and those that did respond demonstrating a lack of
 awareness. Consequently, the investigation team will be making
 recommendations in the area of training, Petrie said. Pressure will be
 applied on organisations such as the British Computer Society to make
 accessibility training more widely available, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Respondents were also asked how easy or useful are the guidelines
 developed by the international Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources">http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources</a>
), regarded as the industry standard. Interestingly, they found that newer guidelines developed by the RNIB
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib1</a>
) are more commonly used than WAI guidelines. One attendee said: "We struggle to understand in terms of
 plain English some of the WAI and government stuff - we've found it
 gobbledygook." Petrie said it was likely the team would make
 recommendations to WAI based on their findings.
</p>
<p> 
 Another attendee said WAI guidelines were hard to follow, and she
 would like to be able to turn to a recommended audit procedure. To
 this Petrie said "That's an absolutely brilliant idea - watch this
 space."
</p>
<p> 
 The project's panel of testers, ten of whom are blind and nine
 partially sighted, have now completed a basic accessibility check - using a
 newly-devised automated method - on the home pages of the 1,000
 sample web sites across five categories including governmental and
 entertainment. Of these, 100 sites that did well in this test were
 selected for more detailed analysis, and this is now half-completed.
 Testers with a range of disabilities, IT knowledge and assistive
 technologies are being filmed as they participate in task-based
 sessions such as filling out an online form - particularly troublesome for
 vision-impaired users according to the team - and performing simple searches.
</p>
<p> 
 One clear early finding is that images on web pages are rarely 'tagged',
 meaning that no text alternative is provided, and texts that are provided
 are not good enough, Petrie said. "This needs to be part of the editorial
 work and not just left to the people implementing the code."
</p>
<p> 
 Another finding was that technology that aims to help people with
 disabilities may not be performing well. "It's very easy to place all
 the blame about accessibility on the web but I was very struck by how
 poorly served people are by their assistive technology" Petrie said.
 She cited screen reader inefficiency and frequent crashing as particular
 problems, and said the team will be making recommendations to
 manufacturers of assistive technology.
</p>
<p> 
 All the project findings will be made available in a DRC report at the
 end of 2003. Most organisations examined will not be named, although
 sites in the top 100 will be allowed information on user testing
 results and awards will be offered to the top ten.
</p>
<p> 
 The creation of a good practice web site may also result from the
 study. Petrie and Beesley plan to make recommendations for resources
 for web site developers, with prototype examples.
</p>
<p> 
 "The challenge is to the web development community," Petrie
 concluded. "If you test your web site on people who use assistive
 technology, then it'll be easy for everyone to use: this is the real
 business case that we can develop."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: BUILDING A DREAMby Andres Crespo  <a href="mailto:andres.crespo@londonconnects.org.uk">andres.crespo@londonconnects.org.uk</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Back in the 1960s Dr Martin Luther King had a dream in which black
 children and white children were playing together. I may not be quite
 as high-achieving as Dr King, but I reserve my right to build my own
 dreams.
</p>
<p> 
 Last night I had a dream.
</p>
<p> 
 I dreamed of an internet playground where all visitors could experience
 the full benefits irrespective of their differences. An internet
 playground where everybody was different but with equal rights to get
 as much as anyone else . an internet space where information (and
 according to Francis Bacon information is power) was not in the hands
 of the establishment, as in previous centuries, but in the hands of all
 of us.
</p>
<p> 
 I woke up this morning and thought about my dream. These days
 legislation is abundant and the technology is mature. In broad terms,
 the Freedom Of Information Act makes it an obligation to make
 information available. The Disability Discrimination Act requires the
 provision of services in equal terms. Conferences constantly remind
 the public sector why and how it should build this paradisiacal internet
 playground where all people, not just the majority, can reap the
 benefits.

 With all this, I naively felt the battle of 'accessibility' had been
 won, and I went to my local pub to celebrate this social victory on e-
 equality. My mate Robin was there, chatting with Ken and Dane.
 Robin is totally blind but can still 'see' more than the average person
 with his sharp hearing, his sense of smell, his touch and his uncommon
 common sense. Ken had been a bright engineer until multiple sclerosis
 hit him and left him severely disabled. Dane is a successful technology
 professional who is dyslexic.
</p>
<p> 
 I told them about my triumphal dream and that in my view the dream
 had become a reality. Looking at their astonished straight faces, I
 couldn't quite make out if they were "pissed" or "pissed off" (excuse
 the language) until I heard what they (the people with disabilities)
 had to say.
</p>
<p> 
 Ken told me that due to his physical condition he cannot use a mouse,
 but this is no problem if developers make sure that navigation is
 possible just by pressing the 'Tab' key. For example, only yesterday he
 visited the central government site that dictates technical standards
 for information exchange, 'Govtalk' (<a href="http://www.govtalk.gov.uk">http://www.govtalk.gov.uk</a>
). He couldn't navigate through the information available in their
 inaccessible scrolling headlines right in the beginning of the home
 page.
</p>
<p> 
 This could have been usually sorted by producing a link to a page with
 breaking news as opposed to scrolling text that is to be avoided
 according to any guidelines available.
</p>
<p> 
 Robin explained that on Ken's example, his speech synthesiser
 wouldn't even pick up the fact that breaking news was being offered
 and was also surprised to see that an HTML frameset, so discouraged
 by every guideline available, had been used. This could have been
 easily avoided if HTML had been used to display the breaking news as
 opposed to a heavily JavaScript solution.
</p>
<p> 
 Dane confessed that he had given up on using "Search" in any
 government site as searches are based on a keyword typed by the user.
 With his dyslexia, words are frequently misspelled (and one cannot
 spell-check when trying to search, can one?), leading to the response:
 'No matches found'.
</p>
<p> 
 This could have been easily avoided if a 'knowledge management'
 package had been used as opposed to a keyword-based search engine.
 Knowledge management allows for misspelling and synonymous terms
 when searching.
</p>
<p> 
 After my enlightening encounter, I decided to wake up and smell the
 coffee. Those that we are looking up to as role models are saying "Do
 as I say, not as I do". Until we see a move from legislation to
 implementation, the accessibility war is still on.
</p>
<p> 
 And you! Yes, you!  Whose side are you on? Are you with the ones
 that act positively and don't talk about it, or those that preach
 impressively but then act against their own advice? The ball is in your
 court.
