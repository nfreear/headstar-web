<h3 id="i41-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Denial Of Access.</h3>
<p> 
 Many web services provided by councils for e-voting trials in the May
 2003 local elections were difficult to find and confusing to navigate,
 while pages providing background information for voters were often
 worse, according to research by the RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
). The result was the services were inaccessible to people with vision
 impairment, who need simple web site structures to use text-to-speech
 or test-to-Braille interfaces.
</p>
<p> 
 This year's e-voting pilots, the largest so far, provided technology
 for
 around 1.5 million voters to cast their votes via the internet,
 touch-tone
 telephones, text messages, digital TV and kiosks. The government has
 set itself a target of offering e-voting nationally by the general
 election
 after next.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2002, RNIB called on the government to include accessibility
 testing in the pilot assessment process. "The Office of the Deputy
 Prime Minister said it wouldn't be necessary because the issue was
 being dealt with. Our results suggest that is not the case," said the
 institute. "In future we'll be contacting all councils reminding them
 of
 their duty to comply with human rights and anti-discrimination law.
 We want to see a scheme where all authorities running pilots gather
 together the information needs of voters and share best practices."
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB report will feed into an Electoral Commission report
 (<a href="http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk">http://www.electoralcommission.gov.uk</a>
) on e-voting to be published later this year. The report will also include findings from the
 Disability
 Rights Commission (<a href="http://www.drc-gb.org">http://www.drc-gb.org</a>
), and the physical disability charity Scope (<a href="http://www.pollsapart.org.uk/survey.asp">http://www.pollsapart.org.uk/survey.asp</a>
).</p>

<h3 id="i41-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: School Test For Remote Control Support.</h3>
<p> 
 A trial service allowing technical support staff to have remote online
 access to computers in schools could drastically cut the time that
 people with disabilities spend sorting out technology problems,
 according to the charity Abilitynet (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk</a>
), a partner in the project.
</p>
<p> 
 The service, which is being offered to school pupils with disabilities
 under the government-funded Communication Aids Project (CAP -
 <a href="http://cap.becta.org.uk">http://cap.becta.org.uk</a>
), enables PC users to contact support staff through a web site. If the problem can't be resolved by email or over
 the phone, users have the option of granting support staff full remote
 access to their machine, allowing them to view and alter files and
 systems without a site visit.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is still at a very early stage, but we expect to provide this
 service
 to 200 users or so over the next few months," said Abilitynet
 operations director David Bains. According to Bains, the service could
 be valuable to the wider community of people with disabilities who
 rely on PCs. "There is a big gap between the help you can get on the
 phone and a site visit - this could help fill that gap", he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The service works over a standard 56K modem and requires no special
 equipment to be installed on the PC. The user can direct staff not to
 access files or applications containing confidential material and
 terminate the connection at any time. If the problem cannot be
 resolved, the PC is returned to its original set-up. "This is very
 useful
 for visually impaired people using a computer for the first time, for
 example if they're having problems with their printer or audio set-up,"
 Bains says.
</p>
<h3 id="i41-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: 'A-Sites' Gateway Goes Live.</h3>
<p> 
 'A-Sites' (<a href="http://www.a-sites.org">http://www.a-sites.org</a>
), a long-awaited web service providing a searchable database of accessible web sites, has been
 launched by the National Library for the Blind (NLB - <a href="http://www.nlb-">http://www.nlb-</a>

 online.org).
</p>
<p> 
 The service currently lists 750 sites, according to the NLB, which
 began building it in summer last year (see E-Access Bulletin issue 31,
 July 2002). An original planned launch date of October 2002 was
 postponed to make way for a redesign of the library's main web site.
</p>
<p> 
 The delayed launch forms part of the NLB's contribution to a central
 government campaign to encourage individuals and social groups who
 are not yet making use of the internet to come online, 'Get Started'
 (<a href="http://www.ukonline.gov.uk/getstarted">http://www.ukonline.gov.uk/getstarted</a>
). The library's other role has been arranging internet access taster sessions in libraries around the
 country (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nlbuk2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nlbuk2</a>
).</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04:  Survey Finds Patchy Access Awareness Ingovernment.
</h3>
<p> 
 A new survey has revealed that only around half of those working to
 create online government services (55 per cent) say they are "very
 aware" of issues surrounding ways of making services accessible to
 people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 A further 36 per cent of survey respondents said they had heard about
 the topic of accessibility, although they lacked strong awareness of
 the
 issues; and 9 per cent "have little or no awareness of the issues."
</p>
<p> 
 The survey was published last week in 'E-Government Outlook 2003-
 2004,' the first comprehensive report on the state of e-government
 services in the UK from E-Access Bulletin publisher Headstar. An

 a planned initiative to deliver concessionary smart cards for people on
 benefits and with registered disabilities in the county.
</p>
<p> 
 Typical providers providing discounted services would be libraries (for
 charged-for services such as CD or cassette loans); leisure centres;
 bus
 operators; and retailers. The card will also act as a single source
 proof
 of identity when claiming housing or council tax benefits, preventing
 the need for repeated proof of eligibility to multiple departments and
 organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'd like to know, and understand, the issues of use of smart cards by
 people with a vision impairment, especially the physical
 characteristics
 of the card by way of the surface graphics and the possibility of
 adding
 a simple Braille ID label," Doggett says. "Also, are there issues

 can generate a debate on some interesting theories published recently
 by the web usability expert Jakob Nielsen.
</p>
<p> 
 In the April issue of his 'AlertBox' newsletter, Jorge says, Nielsen
 wrote an article entitled 'Alternative interfaces for accessibility'
 (<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030407.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030407.html</a>
). The piece advanced two main ideas: first, that "The key difference between user interfaces
 for sighted users and blind users is not that between graphics and
 text;
 it's the difference between 2-D and 1-D [two-dimensional and one-
 dimensional information structures]," and second, that "The biggest
 potential gains [for blind and partially sighted readers] reside in
 creating a special design optimised for auditory presentation."
</p>

 this assessment,

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: INTERVIEW- MICHAEL BURTON.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: WINDOW ONTO THE WORLDby Jemima Kiss  <a href="mailto:jemimakiss@hotmail.com">jemimakiss@hotmail.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The UK's Disability Rights Commission (DRC -
 <a href="http://www.drc.org.uk">http://www.drc.org.uk</a>
), in partnership with the Centre for Human Computer Interaction Design at City University London (<a href="http://www-">http://www-</a>

 hcid.soi.city.ac.uk), announced last month it is to survey a thousand
 websites to identify barriers to accessibility and develop solutions
 (see
 E-Access Bulletin, April 2003).
</p>
<p> 
 The DRC was established by the government in 2000 to promote
 equality of opportunity for disabled people through research and a
 network of support services. Although the commission has been
 operating for three years, however, the new investigation will be the
 first web accessibility work it has carried out.
</p>
<p> 
 Michael Burton, the commissioner leading the project, defends its
 timing by saying it is all a question of priorities. "Important though
 I
 think this issue is, there are many more urgent issues facing disabled
 people and, quite properly, most of our energies are devoted to these."
</p>
<p> 
 However, Burton says the DRC does recognise the internet will
 become an increasingly crucial communications tool for people with
 disabilities. "The internet is tolerant of impairment because content
 can
 be translated into a form to suit the user," he says. "The web is a
 window onto the world, with the potential to liberate disabled people
 and enrich their lives in a variety of ways."
</p>
<p> 
 The UK disability and computing charity AbilityNet
 (<a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk">http://www.abilitynet.org.uk</a>
) estimates that 90 per cent of websites currently pose access problems for disabled users, despite the
 introduction in 1995 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) which
 makes it unlawful for employers, businesses and organisations to
 discriminate against disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 Since 1999, the act has required that organisations must "consider
 making reasonable adjustments" to the delivery of their services to
 allow access by people with disabilities, although it does not
 prescribe
 specific standards of web accessibility. The DRC could play a part in
 any eventual testing of the DDA's applicability to web accessibility,
 by
 supporting complainants in its role as a backer of key legal test cases
 relating to disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall however, the purpose of the project is simply to establish the
 current state of the art and identify what general measures need to be
 taken to improve accessibility. "Previous smaller scale studies suggest
 that nearly all sites will have potential for improvement and that many
 will have serious shortcomings," Burton says.
</p>
<p> 
 "The DRC is in the business of instigating systematic change in the
 environment, rather than setting specific standards - so the impact of
 these findings will not be fast," he says. But I would like to think
 that if
 we carried out the same report in three years' time, there would be a
 significant improvement," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 One problem with this idea is that the commission itself may not be
 around in three years' time. In August 2002 the UK government began
 a consultation process to establish whether a Single Equality
 Commission (SEC) might better implement tighter new EU rules on
 combating discrimination of all kinds. However, despite media
 speculation that such a move might mean the end of the DRC, Burton
 is confident that the future of the organisation is not in doubt.
</p>
<p> 
 "We feel strongly that disability issues have very specific concerns
 and
 these need to be represented by a specialist organisation. Whatever the
 new umbrella structure of an SEC, we have made it clear that we must
 continue to do this."
</p>
<p> 
 Burton was selected to oversee the web accessibility project because of
 his experience as a former chief executive of LIMNET, an interactive
 digital network allowing brokers and underwriters to process insurance
 contracts. He says that for most businesses, the problem of tackling
 web accessibility is likely to be administrative rather than technical.
 "I
 don't want to prejudge the findings of our research, but I suspect that
 we'll need to ensure that what may be seen as a peripheral issue is
 given due attention at every stage in the specification, development
 and
 maintenance of websites."
</p>
<p> 
 For the tests themselves, some key web sites will be pre-selected,
 although most will be chosen randomly from both the private and
 public sectors. The survey will use standard accessibility testing
 software alongside physical testing by people with a variety of
 impairments, to establish the correlation between technical compliance
 and practical usability. The aim is to systematically evaluate sites
 from
 across England, Scotland and Wales that will be representative of those
 typically used by disabled people - including both the private and
 public sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 The work is expected to be completed at the end of 2003, and Burton
 believes the results will be hugely influential in helping to empower
 disabled people as virtual citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 "It will be years before the full potential of the web is realised but
 I am
 delighted to have the opportunity to ensure that the foundations being
 laid now do not disadvantage disabled people, as those laid in the
 physical world too often do."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: ROUND-UP- INTERNATIONAL.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: ACCESS ALL AREAS.by Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a>
</h3>
<p> 
 Over the past 12 months there have been many significant
 developments in Europe and across the world to boost access to digital
 technologies for all.
</p>
<p> 
 The European Commission has dubbed 2003 the European Year of
 People with Disabilities, with the aim of encouraging action, new
 initiatives and alliances within member states to prevent
 discrimination. In March, measures forming part of a wider European
 anti-discrimination initiative were proposed by the lobby group the
 European Disability Forum (EDF - <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org">http://www.edf-feph.org</a>
) together with the European Parliament Disability Intergroup
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/apdg1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/apdg1</a>
), a grouping of MEPs working on disability policy.
</p>
<p> 
 The two bodies unveiled a set of proposals that aimed to ban
 discrimination against disabled users of media, telecommunications
 and online services. The draft required all public bodies to deliver
 internet services in accessible formats, asking for all
 telecommunications services to be made accessible within five years. If
 all proceeds according to plan, the measures could be passed into
 European law by the end of 2003.
</p>
<p> 
 In Ireland, new accessibility guidelines for digital technologies were
 published in July 2002 by the Irish National Disability Authority
 (NDA), the independent statutory body that oversees the country's
 disability policy. The guidelines, which were based on consultation
 with both service users and providers, used a broad-brush approach to
 cover electronic services such as web sites; public access terminals;
 telecoms terminals and application software aimed at procurement
 managers and technology developers (<a href="http://www.accessit.nda.ie">http://www.accessit.nda.ie</a>
). The authority said the guidelines, and associated innovative web-based
 tools to help bodies comply, represented "a new practical dimension to
 Irish national and European laws on accessibility".
</p>
<p> 
 The US has been a legislative pacesetter with the enactment of section
 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (amended in 1998)
 (<a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
) which requires that all new technology systems designed or commissioned by federal agencies must be
 accessible to people with disabilities. The law also covers federally
 funded programs and services, but not web pages of private industry.
 An independent Access Board created by the law regulates
 accessibility and develops technologies providing technical assistance
 and training on the guidelines and standards of section 508.
</p>
<p> 
 Early in 2003, however, US publication Government Computer News
 reported that US government initiatives were making slow progress
 implementing section 508 regulations. Many departments are reported
 to only be adapting their services a year beyond the deadline for
 compliance (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/gcn">http://fastlink.headstar.com/gcn</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 In lower-income countries, heightened problems exist for people with
 disabilities due to a general lack of funds for technology and
 training.
 Special access technologies, which often require extra investment, are
 rarely available, so people with disabilities find themselves doubly
 disadvantaged.
</p>
<p> 
 Moves to tackle this problem by raising awareness in the development
 community were launched in March 2003 at a meeting held in the
 Philippines, attended by representatives of ten Asian countries, the US
 and Canada (see <a href="http://www.worldenable.net/manila2003">http://www.worldenable.net/manila2003</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Delegates issued an urgent call to the United Nations to build basic
 technology accessibility rules into all its development programmes.
 The countries also called for the undertaking of a global study on
 norms and standards for technology accessibility in the developing
 world.
</p>
<p> 
 The event, 'empowering persons with disabilities through ICT',
 suggested a pilot 'web site accessibility assessment tool' and training
 materials should be developed which are specifically tailored to the
 needs of people living in poorer nations. It remains to be seen whether
 the UN, in these busy times for world diplomacy, will take action in
 this vital area later in the year.
