<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i48-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Revolutionary Speech Technology To Launch.</h3>
<p> 
 New synthetic speech technology is set to revolutionise the way blind
 and partially sighted people access newspaper and magazine content,
 according to the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The institute has joined forces with specialist firm Rhetorical
 (<a href="http://www.rhetorical.com">http://www.rhetorical.com</a>
) to create CD versions of magazines. The Rhetorical technology, called rVoice, uses "voice modelling" to
 record
 real voices; analyse pronunciation and intonation; and produce a
 model
 of each voice which predicts how individual words would be
 pronounced. The result can translate text into synthetic speech which
 is
 "virtually indistinguishable" from a human voice, says Steve Tyler,
 policy and ICT access manager at the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 Until now, text-to-speech technologies have often produced
 artificial-
 sounding voices that are confusing and off-putting. As a result,
 users
 have preferred recordings of newspapers and magazines read on to tape
 by actors and volunteers, a time-consuming and expensive process.
 Using rVoice however, a TV listing which currently takes an RNIB
 volunteer around 17 hours to record can be reproduced in less than an
 hour.
</p>
<p> 
 The system has considerable potential for specialist applications,
 Tyler
 says. "Take accountancy course materials which are very technical.
 They would cost around 60,000 pounds to produce in audio, mainly
 because of the specialist knowledge required to 'translate' the
 content.
 With Rhetorical, voices can be 'trained' for specific subjects by
 recording accountancy terminology, substantially reducing production
 costs."
</p>
<p> 
 Later this month, the RNIB is launching pilot CD versions of the TV
 listings magazines 'Radio Times' and 'TV Times' using rVoice. The
 magazines will be tested by users of DAISY digital talking book
 players, and there are plans to test other delivery mechanisms such
 as
 telephones and the internet.
</p>
<h3 id="i48-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Microsoft Legal Actions Set To Continue.</h3>
<p> 
 Legal wrangling between US lobby groups and Microsoft over the
 accessibility of its software seem set to continue, despite a plea
 from
 the company last month that it has realised the error of its ways,
 and it
 was time to "call off the lawyers" so everyone could proceed in
 partnership.
</p>
<p> 
 The call came from Madelyn Bryant McIntire, the Director of
 Microsoft's Accessibility Group, as she delivered the keynote address
 to last month's Techshare conference on access to technology, hosted
 by the RNIB (<a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 McIntire admitted that Microsoft's user testing had until now
 "overlooked" people with sight problems, but that would now change.
 She said the company now recognised that such people form a
 significant market segment: for example, a survey by research
 company Forrester of 15,000 households in the US found that around
 28 per cent of all citizens say they have either correctible or non
 correctible vision problems with reading newsprint (though the survey
 did not ask about accessing computer screens).
</p>
<p> 
 However, McIntire said that legal action had made the discussion too
 rigid and that it was time to "call off the lawyers". This was
 understood
 by most present to refer to consumer organisations in the US which
 have fought hard in the courts over measures such as section 508,
 which requires all technology companies supplying the US federal
 government to ensure their products are accessible to all.
</p>
<p> 
 The answer is partnership, not confrontation, McIntire said. She said
 terms like "disability" and "impairment" were barriers to effective
 dialogue, and a better term was "social inclusion".
</p>
<p> 
 However Janina Sajka, director of director of technology research and
 development at the American Foundation for the Blind, said later: "I
 am glad Microsoft has discovered the disability continuum, but I hate
 to think where blind people would be if we had not used legal means
 to
 extract some accessibility out of major companies. We're not about to
 call off the lawyers."

<p> 
 The winners of the Visionary Design Awards for high quality
 accessible web sites (<a href="http://visdesign.nlbuk.org">http://visdesign.nlbuk.org</a>
) were announced this week by the National Library for the Blind in the UK (NLB -
 <a href="http://www.nlb-online.org">http://www.nlb-online.org</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The winners were 'The friendly duck'
 (<a href="http://www.calibre.org.uk/Kids">http://www.calibre.org.uk/Kids</a>
),  new web site for kids from the Calibre cassette library, in the youth and education category;
 'Adviceguide' (<a href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk">http://www.adviceguide.org.uk</a>
), from Citizens Advice, for news and information; Rushcliffe Borough Council
 (<a href="http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk">http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk</a>
), for government; Manchester United football club (<a href="http://www.manutd.com/access">http://www.manutd.com/access</a>
), for large organisations;
 comedy show the Bradshaws (<a href="http://www.thebradshaws.biz">http://www.thebradshaws.biz</a>
), for small to medium organisations; and Birmingham Focus on Blindness
 (<a href="http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk">http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk</a>
) for voluntary organisations.</p>
<p> 
 Winners were nominated by vision-impaired people, web designers
 and site owners. A spokeswoman for the NLB said the organisation
 aims to use the awards as part of an ongoing campaign to encourage
 website developers to consider access technology.

<h3 id="i48-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Tv Channel Five Adds Audio Description.</h3>
<p> 
 The TV station Five (<a href="http://www.five.tv">http://www.five.tv</a>
 - formerly Channel Five) has become the first UK public service broadcaster to offer an audio
 description service using digital satellite broadcasting, increasing
 the
 number of people able to receive description from 4.5 to 7.1 million
 in
 one fell swoop.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio description adds a verbal description of what is taking place
 on
 screen between pieces of dialogue. Previously Five had offered this
 service on Freeview (<a href="http://www.freeview.co.uk">http://www.freeview.co.uk</a>
), the digital terrestrial
 service delivered through a set-top box.
</p>
<p> 
 However, manufacturers have been slow to develop Freeview boxes
 that can receive audio description, which is currently only
 accessible to
 45 trial viewers. By adding audio description to its service
 delivered
 over BSkyB satellite (<a href="http://www.sky.com">http://www.sky.com</a>
), Five is now reaching millions of homes with the service. BSkyB itself - though not a free-
 to-air channel with a regulated public service element like the main
 five UK terrestrial channels - already delivers some 3,000 hours a
 year
 of audio described programming on its pay channels such as Sky One
 and Sky News.
</p>
<p> 
 Some Freeview equipment is now being developed to receive audio
 description. RNIB digital broadcasting development officer Clive
 Miller says two products are in the pipeline: Nebula DigiTV
 (<a href="http://www.nebula.electronics.com">http://www.nebula.electronics.com</a>
), a digital TV receiver for use with
 PCs, and i-Player, a Freeview receiver from Netgem
 (<a href="http://www.netgem.com">http://www.netgem.com</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Delivery technology is not the only barrier to the development of
 audio
 description, however - the descriptions need to be written and
 recorded
 in the first place. The target for audio - described content was
 recently
 raised from six to ten per cent by the time a broadcaster is in its
 tenth
 year of service under the Communications Act 2003, with a draft code
 on compliance to be put out for consultation by the new industry
 regulator Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">http://www.ofcom.org.uk</a>
) later this month.</p>
<p> 
 However, the RNIB has criticised the ten per cent quota and is
 campaigning for it to be raised to 50 per cent. The organisation is
 also
 lobbying the BBC, ITV and Channel Four to follow the example of
 Five and to use the existing BSkyB system to deliver their audio-
 described content.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Readers wishing to support the RNIB's campaign for more
 audio description can email <a href="mailto:campaign@rnib.org.uk">campaign@rnib.org.uk</a> for draft letters to send to broadcasters and politicians.

<h3 id="i48-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: FLAT OUT:</h3>
<p>  Robby Barnes of the Kaizen Program for New English Learners with Visual Limitations in Seattle, Washington
 writes
 to add to our recent correspondence on the use of screen magnifiers
 with flat-screen monitors (see also Inbox, last issue).
</p>
<p> 
 "The problems I have experienced with a flat-screen monitor with
 ZoomText screen magnification at 5x or 6x involved 'ghosting'
 (breaking up of the screen image) when I moved the mouse or scrolled
 the page up or down. This made it very tiring to read with
 magnification for any length of time. Regular monitors don't have
 this
 problem because they have a much faster refresh rate.
</p>
<p> 
 "Is it possible that the TFT iiyama AS 4611 UT 18-inch screen has a
 faster than usual refresh rate which makes it compatible with screen
 magnification?" NOTE: in our last issue, Chris McMillan said that she
 had encountered no problems using ZoomText with this iiyama screen.
 [Further responses please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<h3 id="i48-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: MUSIC QUIZ:</h3>
<p>  Scott Rae of the Highland Society for Blind People has a quick question about accessible music tools. "I work
 with
 visually impaired teens, and we are exploring their barriers to
 social
 inclusion and they are starting to challenge them. Have any readers
 come across technology that would help visually impaired youth read
 sheet music?" Suggestions please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i48-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: BUGBEAR SLAIN:</h3>
<p>  The blind barrister Fayyaz Afzal, profiled in our November issue, said his biggest technology bugbear was not
 being able to read text messages on his mobile phone. Lynn
 Holdsworth, Web Developer at the RNIB, writes in to say: "Perhaps
 this would be of interest to Fayyaz. I'm currently using a Nokia 3650
 with an excellent beta version of the Talx [speech output] software
 that
 runs on Symbian phones.
</p>
<p> 
 "The software should be commercially released in the next month or
 so. With it I'm able to check my battery and signal strength, read
 text
 messages, use contact lists and the appointment scheduler. I don't
 yet
 have access to WAP, but that's about the only thing that's lacking."
</p>
<h3 id="i48-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: CLEAR SPEECH:</h3>
<p>  In our last issue, we ran a news piece saying that the US analyst Donna Fluss of DMG Consulting was predicting
 that the worldwide market for speech technology products is set to
 leap
 forward over the next 18 to 24 months.
</p>
<p> 
 After reading the piece, Jo Fullerton, Lead Technology Officer (pre-
 16) at the RNIB Education Centre Scotland, wrote in with a point of
 clarification: "Do you think all your readers will realise that Donna
 Fluss is talking about speech control of computers (voice recognition
 and voice input) rather than screen readers? It took me a while
 reading
 her original article to be clear that she is talking about speech
 mainly as
 an input device rather than as output.
</p>
<p> 
 "Nevertheless, there are links between the technologies, so hopefully
 this business thrust will benefit blind users of computers too. I
 suppose
 if speech input did become as accurate as keyboarding and some of the
 other difficulties were reduced, those blind people who have not
 learned touch typing should benefit."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b> SECTION THREE: SPECIAL REPORT- WEB AWARDS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: DESIGNS FOR LIFEby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 "It's a funny thing building an accessible web site: people don't
 always
 realise the work that goes into it", says Emma Charles, one of six
 web
 site producers honoured at this month's 'Visionary Design' awards
 (<a href="http://www.visionary-design.org">http://www.visionary-design.org</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The awards, hosted by the National Library for the Blind (NLB -
 <a href="http://www.nlb-online.org">http://www.nlb-online.org</a>
), were judged by a panel including ten people with vision impairment. Emma Charles' company TWI
 Interactive (<a href="http://www.twii.net">http://www.twii.net</a>
) produced the web site for the Manchester United football team (<a href="http://www.manutd.com">http://www.manutd.com</a>
) which scooped the 'large organisation' prize.
</p>
<p> 
 Manchester United plc has a formal policy to meet the needs of its
 disabled supporters (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mufc1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mufc1</a>
), working with
 the Manchester United Disabled Supporters Association (MUDSA -
 <a href="http://www.mudsa.com">http://www.mudsa.com</a>
). The policy includes a commitment to web accessibility, and members of MUDSA, one of whom is vision-
 impaired, helped to test the team's web site before it went live.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the team's main web site is not fully accessible, there is a
 separate accessible site carrying most of the information to be found
 on
 the main site. "You can change the text size up to a high level while
 maintaining the page layout (see <a href="http://www.manutd.com/access">http://www.manutd.com/access</a>
), so people with vision difficulties don't necessarily have to use screen
 magnification, which can create a bit of disorientation," Charles
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 Also popular with the judges was the way users of the site can choose
 colour combinations: "You can choose to 'skin' your web site in one
 of
 the colours of the Manchester United kits," says Charles. Luckily,
 the
 team's kit colours coincide well with those colour combinations that
 many people with impaired vision find easier to use.
</p>
<p> 
 The winner of the award in the government category was Rushcliffe
 Borough Council (<a href="http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk">http://www.rushcliffe.gov.uk</a>
) in Nottinghamshire. The council's one-man-band web developer Laura van Weyenbergh
 claims accessible features of the site "are nothing revolutionary."
 She
 says: "I started it because I felt passionate about it, but anyone at
 the
 award ceremony would have felt inspired - it made me more fired up".
</p>
<p> 
 Referring to the international Web Accessibility Initiative
 guidelines
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>
), whose highest standard is known as 'AAA', she says "I was quite surprised we won because we were not
 AAA compliant". The site does however include a facility to make the
 text display larger; 'access keys' to assist browsing using a
 keyboard
 rather than a mouse; and advice on how to make Adobe pdf files more
 accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Other winners included Birmingham Focus on Blindness, which also
 received a British Interactive Media Association award last week
 (<a href="http://www.bima.co.uk/content_awards/2003-shortlist.html">http://www.bima.co.uk/content_awards/2003-shortlist.html</a>
); and The Bradshaws Online (<a href="http://www.thebradshaws.biz">http://www.thebradshaws.biz</a>
), the web site of a radio comedy show about a working class Mancunian in the 1960s. It
 started life as a cult late-night show on Manchester's Piccadilly
 Radio
 and is now syndicated to stations worldwide.
</p>
<p> 
 Darren Poyzer, designer of The Bradshaws Online, describes himself
 as "one guy who works out of a bedroom," who initially designed the
 site as a favour for a friend. He says: "We were under no brief to
 create
 an accessible version of the web site, there was no political
 motivation.
 It was just a natural thing to do - because it's radio, we probably
 have a
 bigger vision-impaired following."
</p>
<p> 
 Poyzer says he incorporated the accessible version of the web site
 within the theme of the site, in a black and white "traditional"
 version.
 "I undid all the science and used a bit of common sense. You've got
 to
 look at things from the user's point of view, not always a technical
 point of view".
</p>
<p> 
 Why does he think he won the award? "[At the ceremony], the first
 message was that it is so easy to navigate, and it's enjoyable",
 Poyzer
 says. "I'm certainly no expert: a visually impaired person has tapped
 into a web site I've done and it's worked."
</p>
<p> 
 Poyzer said he was "overwhelmed by the enthusiasm" of one vision-
 impaired woman he met at the ceremony who had nominated the site.
 "That was the award," he said.

 - see also story 02, News, this issue).
</p>
<p> 
 On the advocacy side, the fact that most people with sight problems
 are
 more concerned about being able to use consumer electronics and
 telephones than home computers seems to have finally hit home. And
 on the industry side, in a volte face of spectacular proportions, the
 major players Microsoft and Vodafone admitted that the world was not
 divided between a handful of severely disabled and troublesome people
 on the one hand and an overwhelming majority of able and satisfied
 people on the other. They finally discovered the disability
 continuum:
 from total blindness to reading problems with standard format on-
 screen text.
</p>
<p> 
 What bliss! We are no longer part of the awkward squad, but an
 important market segment; and the industry objective is not to bury
 us
 but to praise us!
</p>
<p> 
 The fact that the technology industry's Damascene conversion has
 arrived so late is a direct reflection of the vision impairment
 sector's
 past tendency to focus on proper but minority concerns about
 accessing
 technology in education and employment. But as access to television,
 radio, mobile phones and the like are more mainstream concerns
 shared by almost all people with impaired vision, it is right that
 there
 has now been a shift of emphasis towards these household devices.
</p>
<p> 
 It is also appropriate that the two people who are most responsible
 for
 this change of attitude can share the credit for Techshare's success.
 The
 RNIB's Richard Orme and Steve Tyler have, in their various ways,
 broadened the horizon of the whole sector to think about DVDs and
 phones as well as word processing and computer programming. So
 often accused of being backward looking, this is an area where RNIB
 is miles ahead of most of the rest of the vision impairment sector.
</p>
<p> 
 This has been achieved not least because the institute has
 increasingly
 moved towards evidence based policy-making, exemplified by the
 early results of the 'uses of technology' research carried out by
 City
 University: watch this space.
</p>
<p> 
 The other great pleasure of Techshare this year was the reduced
 amount of 'technophilia' and a much increased recognition of human
 factors. Even when access technology works - and the failure rate is
 depressingly but predictably high from a hitherto fragmented market
 of
 small niche suppliers - the key to interactive success is self
 confidence
 and a feeling of being in control. On these points the debate is much
 better balanced.
</p>
<p> 
 A third welcome change of tone worth noting at this year's event was
 an apparent new willingness among lobby groups to come to terms
 with the technological and regulatory complexities of the access
 agenda. Most delegates were certainly less stridently dogmatic this
 year; the subordinate clause has, so to speak, come home.
</p>
<p> 
 All this may well be a false dawn. As technologies advance, the
 comparative disadvantage between people with sight problems and the
 rest of the world widens in spite of solid progress; and if the
 commercial sector's objective is to use soft language to try ward off
 trouble, it would not be the first time.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, however, it would be wrong to end on a negative note.
 Techshare was a fine and varied collage of snapshots of where we are
 now. Its challenge will be to work out a way to fascinate us now that
 neither acrimony nor a search for paradise remain on the agenda.
