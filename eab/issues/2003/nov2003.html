<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i47-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Award For Tv Voice Control Experiment.</h3>
<p> 
 An experimental system allowing people to access digital television
 sets using voice commands has won a Royal Television Society award
 for technical innovation (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rts1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rts1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The Virtual Human Interface for a Set-Top box Agent (VISTA -
 <a href="http://www.vista-epg.org.uk">http://www.vista-epg.org.uk</a>
) interacts with the viewer through voice commands rather than the handset with onscreen menu format that
 makes current digital TV electronic programme guides (EPGs) difficult
 to use for many people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 With VISTA, a virtual person appears and speaks directly to the
 viewer, asking questions and responding to voice commands for
 services. Unlike many interactive voice response systems, VISTA is
 also designed to respond to a broad range of pronunciation. "As part
 of the project we used testers with a range of accents. One person was
 Glaswegian for example," said project manager Dr Jonathan Freeman.
 According to Freeman, the VISTA technology is designed to be
 compatible with set-top boxes which are already widely-used such as
 those issued with the Freeview and BskyB broadcast services.
</p>
<p> 
 It is unclear if the VISTA project team, which included the
 Independent Television Commision, BSkyB and City University, will
 develop the project further. "It has to be emphasised that the aim
 was to demonstrate the concept, not develop a product," said Freeman.
 However, Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.gov.uk">http://www.ofcom.gov.uk</a>
), the new regulator of digital communications, is scheduled to launch a public consultation
 on access to EPGs later this month.
</p>
<h3 id="i47-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Guide To Work Experience Placements.</h3>
<p> 
 Advice on work experience placements for students with disabilities,
 including those with impaired vision, is offered in a new free guide
 from Skill (<a href="http://www.skill.org.uk">http://www.skill.org.uk</a>
), the national organisation for students with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 'Into work experience' (<a href="http://www.skill.org.uk/shared/into_we.asp">http://www.skill.org.uk/shared/into_we.asp</a>
) includes practical advice about finding and starting a placement;
 disabled people's legal rights; a reference section listing helpful
 publications and organisations; a section for employers highlighting
 the benefits of taking on disabled people; and contributions from
 students about their varied experiences of work placements.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Jenny Hayden, a blind former student at the University
 of North London who supplied one of the case studies, a work placement
 may be difficult at first but can pay off in the longer term. "It was
 really hard going into an unfamiliar environment, to do a new job
 with
 people I didn't know," she told E-Access Bulletin. "But it's a good
 way
 of finding out the difficult things with a safety net," she said. "I
 now feel quite happy about looking for any kind of job."
</p>
<p> 
 A particular difficulty was gaining access to company IT systems
 during her work placement, Hayden said. "I use a Braille 'n Speak
 notetaker but the IT department wouldn't let me load any equipment
 onto their computers. So the office manager transferred data onto a
 disk, and onto my notetaker," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The guide is available in large print, tape, disk or Braille format.

<h3 id="i47-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Sentient Access To E-Learning Resources.</h3>
<p> 
 E-learning could become easier for vision-impaired lecturers and
 students with the launch of an accessible version of a web-based
 product that can search digital content held in university libraries.
</p>
<p> 
 According to developer Sentient Learning
 (<a href="http://www.sentientlearning.com">http://www.sentientlearning.com</a>
), its upgraded Sentient Discover software is the first of its kind to receive a 'triple A' rating when
 tested
 against the international Web Accessibility Initiative standards
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Sentient Discover sits between online learning environments, such as
 WebCT and Blackboard, and resources such as library and online
 journal catalogues. It enables academics and course designers to
 search
 a university's entire bank of resources and to construct online
 resource
 lists for their courses. Students can use the lists to discover if a
 library
 book is out on loan for example, or to link directly to an online
 journal article.
</p>
<p> 
 However, although Sentient Discover is designed to be accessible,
 colleges and universities will also need to ensure that the
 information
 retrieved by the software is also presented in accessible formats.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, Sentient Discover is used by the universities of Leeds,
 Edinburgh and Middlesex, and the London School of Economics.
 Users of earlier versions may upgrade to the accessible version free
 of charge.
</p>
<h3 id="i47-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Speech Technology Market Set To Explode.</h3>
<p> 
 The worldwide market for speech technology products is set to leap
 forward over the next 18 to 24 months, according to one leading US
 analyst.
</p>
<p> 
 Donna Fluss, a principal at DMG Consulting
 (<a href="http://www.dmgconsult.com">http://www.dmgconsult.com</a>
), says a number of changes signal that the market is set to take off. "In the last five years, the accuracy
 of speech applications has reached more than 95 per cent," says Fluss.
 "That is a crucial threshold in terms of it gaining wider
 acceptance."
</p>
<p> 
 The cost of speech hardware has also dropped significantly, Fluss
 says.
 Vendors such as Intel have been cutting the cost of voice boards
 continually, while infrastructure vendors such as IBM, HP, Oracle and
 Intel are taking this market more seriously than ever before.
</p>
<p> 
 One reason for this increased activity may be the entrance of
 Microsoft
 into the market, she says. "Microsoft's involvement will move speech
 to the forefront and raise awareness. It will also force the hand of
 the other vendors to invest more widely."
</p>
<p> 
 Technology analysts Gartner (<a href="http://www.gartner.com">http://www.gartner.com</a>
) are also predicting strong growth in the sector. Their latest reports say the
 global speech software license market will grow from 127.5 million
 dollars in 2002 to more than 258 million dollars in 2007.

<p>  Ruth Loebl, Senior technology development officer with the RNIB's Technology in Learning and
 Employment division, writes in with a warning against a tendency to
 define the term 'accessibility' too narrowly.
</p>
<p> 
 "Is there some creeping influence at work, whereby the word
 'accessibility' is starting to mean 'web accessibility', leaving
 other
 technologies and issues out in the cold? In your October issue there
 was a notice which said: "Accessify Forum is a web-based discussion
 forum devoted to all topics relating to accessibility." It isn't,
 it's devoted to all topics relating to web accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 "Similarly, the European Accessibility Consortium (section four,
 October issue) hasn't called itself the European Web Accessibility
 Consortium, despite the fact that that's what it is.
</p>
<p> 
 "There are many other types of accessibility - access to software, to
 fax machines and photocopiers, access to information, to kiosks and
 cashpoints, to telephone systems, to buildings and to services. My
 team
 has been looking in particular at the accessibility of IT systems on
 desktop PC interfaces, and the need to address accessibility at the
 very
 start of the procurement process rather than trying to add on access
 technology at some late stage.
</p>
<p> 
 "We are drawing together a group of organisations that share this
 view

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b> SECTION THREE: TECHNOLOGY- GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: EYES IN THE SKYby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The ability to know exactly where you are at any particular time by
 using signals sent from satellites is of clear use to people sailing
 boats
 or driving cars. But it is also of enormous value to people who are
 blind, potentially allowing far greater independence of movement.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently, the main working technology in this field is the Global
 Positioning System (GPS), which uses a network of 24 satellites in
 geostationary orbits 11,000 miles high positioned so that at least
 three
 are visible from any point on the Earth.
</p>
<p> 
 GPS receivers use triangulation of radio signals sent by these
 satellites
 to work out the position of a person or object to within 10 metres or
 so.
 The system is owned, operated and licensed for civilian use by the US
 military, which itself uses an enhanced service with an accuracy of
 one centimetre or less.
</p>
<p> 
 The main player in the application of GPS technology to location
 finders for blind people is Canadian firm VisuAide, with its Victor
 Trekker device (<a href="http://www.visuaide.com/gpssol.html">http://www.visuaide.com/gpssol.html</a>
), which came on to the UK market in June this year with assistance from the RNIB.
 "People are exploring their locale like they've never been able to do
 in the past," says Mervyn Robertson, technical director of Sight and
 Sound Technology (<a href="http://www.sightandsound.co.uk">http://www.sightandsound.co.uk</a>
) which distributes the Trekker. It currently costs 1,125 UK pounds, although the price
 will come down, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 A Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) with a GPS receiver attached to a
 harness, the device is hooked up to an electronic voice-box that
 provides location data to the user using electronic maps developed by
 Navigation Technologies (<a href="http://www.navtech.com">http://www.navtech.com</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The Trekker allows users to add to existing information by recording
 "points of interest" such as "I'm home now" or "I'm at the bank"
 which can be recorded and played back on familiar routes. Where the
 information is available, Robertson says, pub and restaurant names
 are programmed into maps.
</p>
<p> 
 "You can say "where am I?" and it'll say "23 South Street", but it
 doesn't allow you to pre-plan a route," says Robertson. However, this
 looks set to change this February, when the Trekker will provide a
 free
 upgrade to all users, making route-planning available for the first
 time.
</p>
<p> 
 One potential pitfall of GPS is loss of signal. If a satellite is out
 of range or if users are situated in built-up areas for example,
 navigation
 temporarily disappears. "In a narrow street or alley, if you don't
 have
 the satellite to view, you could potentially be in a bit of trouble,"
 Robertson says.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr John Gill, chief scientist at the RNIB, says that for GPS
 technology
 to work well, navigational data needs to include temporary as well as
 permanent outdoor features and information such as which side of the
 Town Hall the front entrance is located, or whether there are
 roadworks.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr Gill says the most promising development in this field is being
 developed by a team at Brunel University headed by Professor Bala
 Balachandran. The team is developing a system which uses existing
 mobile phone technology linked to a control centre staffed by human
 operators.
</p>
<p> 
 "A blind person will never totally rely on technology," Balachandran
 says. "They like a friendly voice at the other end. If the blind
 person
 wants to go from A to B, they press a button and an operator knows
 exactly the location of the blind person." The operator sees a
 digital
 map with the whereabouts of the user and verbally guides them.
</p>
<p> 
 The beauty of the Brunel system is that users don't have to have
 guidance all the time and the navigated area doesn't have to be
 familiar
 territory, he says. The opportunity for two-way conversation also
 makes it a potentially useful tool for people with intellectual as
 well as
 visual impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 To avoid signal loss inside buildings or underground, the Brunel team
 have also devised a wearable TV camera to allow the operator to
 continue guiding. The system also has the potential to allow
 relatives
 or friends to navigate the vision-impaired user.
</p>
<p> 
 The Brunel project already has the support of mobile phone company
 02 and the mapping agency Ordnance Survey, but is currently seeking
 further funding to develop the product for market. When ready the
 device should cost no more than a high specification mobile phone,
 Balachandran says.
</p>
<p> 
 One final concern remains. Because GPS is US military-owned, in
 times of war or crisis the system could theoretically be cut off or
 restricted. "You're at the beck and call of the American military,"
 Robertson says. This could soon change with the launch of GALILEO,
 a complementary European navigation system due to launch its first
 satellite next year (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/galileo1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/galileo1</a>
). The future for
 Europe could be pinpoint accurate.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: INTERVIEW- FAYYAZ AFZAL.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: COURT LIFEby Phil Cain  <a href="mailto:phil@vitalpublishing.com">phil@vitalpublishing.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 "My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky - or a murder
 in the offing," said Horace Rumpole, the iconic lawyer created by
 novelist John Mortimer. But 26-year-old Fayyaz Afzal, one of only
 three barristers currently practising in the UK who are registered as
 blind, shows little enthusiasm for murder trials.
</p>
<p> 
 The reason for this is not his blindness. One might think that an
 inability to see would be an insurmountable handicap in a murder
 trial,
 with the presentation of bloodstained instruments and other pieces of
 evidence in plastic bags to examine and hand round. In fact however,
 "with exhibits there has always got to be a written statement with
 it,
 otherwise it is not a piece of evidence," Afzal says.
</p>
<p> 
 The real reason for his disinclination to work on such cases is that,
 "murders are the most boring cases because they are all to do with
 forensic science, with experts spending a whole day telling you how
 eminent they are." Afzal's low boredom threshold means that a fast-
 moving robbery trial lasting three to four weeks is much more to his
 liking.
</p>
<p> 
 A love of law films and an urge to help other people led Afzal to his
 profession, and since qualifying as a barrister in 1999 he has been
 involved in a wide range of cases on immigration, family law, road
 traffic and crime, working from Leicester's New Walk chambers
 (<a href="http://www.newwalkchambers.co.uk">http://www.newwalkchambers.co.uk</a>
). "You don't really have control of cases that come in, it's a case of supply and demand. Robbery,
 burglary, theft, assault, public order - I do anything that comes up
 in the magistrate or crown court," he says.
</p>

 Although he still has a very small amount of sight, closed circuit
 television magnifiers can only give him the gist of what is on a
 page. "I
 still walk around with reams of paper under my arm, but just for
 effect," he jokes. But the paper documents are useful to him as well
 because he carries a portable scanner and a speech-enabled laptop.
 Although he learned Braille at primary school, he doesn't use it a
 great
 deal. "If I had all the papers I needed in printed out in Braille I
 would need a wheelbarrow," he says.

 Judges who ask if he can manage soon realise they need not worry, he
 says. While in court he makes and refers to notes using his laptop
 and an earphone and has the knack of touch-typing while standing to
 cross-examine witnesses. When giving a complex closing speech to
 summarise his argument he uses a set of around 25 bullet point
 prompts spoken through his earphone. "Anyone will tell you that the
 best speeches are never written down verbatim," he says.

<p> 
 With a typical workload of five or six hours of preparation for a
 court
 appearance the following morning, and a wife and three children at
 home, learning to surf the internet has had to wait.
</p>
<p> 
 "I don't use the internet myself, but I need it all the time," Afzal
 says.
 It is particularly useful when researching immigration cases when, for
 example, someone says they might be stoned to death for committing
 adultery if sent back to Iran. To find out how true such a statement
 is he sits with one of his assistants as they summarise pages from the
 Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International web sites. If it sounds
 relevant he will ask them to cut and paste the text into a document
 which he can read from his laptop.
</p>
<p> 
 With faxes remaining the most common way for legal documents to be
 sent, either he or an assistant has to scan them into his machine.
 But
 email is becoming more popular, and the arrival of fax machines able
 to send faxes to email addresses means there is likely to be more in
 his inbox and less under his arm in future.
</p>
<p> 
 Afzal is also excited about the ease of getting online with his new
 laptop which contains a wireless internet card, providing broadband
 connections to the internet in wireless "hot spots". His biggest
 technology bugbear, he says, is not being able to read text messages.
 Instead he uses his Nokia 3310 to send and receive voice messages.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, Afzal finds life around the courts to be more friendly and
 less
 formal than is often supposed. "It's a very embracing profession.
 There
 are some very nice people," he says. Of those who succumb to
 stereotypical stuffiness, he says: "It is not them, it is the job. If
 you don't keep your social life alive then you end up like them."
