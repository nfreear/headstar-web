<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Councils Face Web Standards Mismatch.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB's high-profile 'See it Right' web accessibility audit scheme, which launched in
 February 2002, does not match new government requirements for local council web sites, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 So far four local authorities - Kensington and Chelsea, Thurrock, Welwyn Hatfield and 
 Wrexham councils - have paid to receive See it Right accreditation
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib3</a>
) although Welwyn Hatfield council covered their costs  through sponsorship.
</p>
<p> 
 The See It Right scheme is based on a series of 'checkpoints' based on guidelines published
 by the global Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
 - see also issue 31,  July 2003 and issue 38, February 2002).
</p>
<p> 
 For web sites to pass the audit and receive the See It Right logo, they need to fully comply 
 with WAI level 'A' guidelines, but only partially with the higher 'AA' and 'AAA' standards.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem for councils is that the government-required standards they must meet in their 
 Implementing E-Government (IEG) statements, which declare whether electronic public 
 service targets are being met, were raised last July to a minimum of full compliance with 
 WAI level 'AA'.
</p>
<p> 
 The discrepancy is causing confusion among councils currently waiting to join the RNIB 
 audit scheme such as Dorset County Council. Martin Bottomley, communications manager at 
 Dorset, is unsure whether his authority may incur government funding penalties by obtaining 
 an audit. "All of a sudden the goal posts have been moved," he told E-Access Bulletin. His
 team will make a final decision on 16 October. 
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB does offer a service where they will audit a site against any chosen accessibility 
 guidelines such as WAI AA, although the process takes longer and costs more than See it 
 Right.
</p>
<p> 
 However, RNIB web accessibility best practice officer Lis Angle said the aspects of WAI 
 'AA' compliance that are excluded by the See it Right audit are "very difficult to achieve." 
 She said the RNIB did not have plans to re-examine their audit guidelines. "Government sites 
 are a small proportion of sites we audit. We're really happy with what we have in our 
 requirements. We think we've covered everything. We are keeping our standards as they are".
</p>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: New Software For Musical Scores.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessible Music, a software tool for blind and vision-impaired people that produces spoken 
 and Braille scores from scanned sheet music in seven languages, is to be launched at the end 
 of the year by FNB Netherlands, a Dutch state-subsidised accessible library.
</p>
<p> 
 The software allows users to hear the contents of an entire book of musical scores, saving 
 what can amount to months of waiting time to obtain accessible sheet music. Users track 
 detail down to individual bars and notes, playing fragments or accessing detailed spoken 
 descriptions.
</p>
<p> 
 "Everything that's on the page of a music score is represented on talking music," a 
 spokesperson from FNB Netherlands said.
</p>
<p> 
 The tool uses the structure of the international DAISY standard for e-books 
 (<a href="http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a>
). It will be marketed to amateur and professional musicians,  composers, teachers, librarians, publishers, software engineers and technologists through the 
 FNB web site (<a href="http://projects.fnb.nl/am/home.html">http://projects.fnb.nl/am/home.html</a>
), conferences and workshops and sold  initially under licence before it is sold to individuals. FNB has not yet agreed on a retail price.
</p>
<p> 
 A free demonstration CD of Accessible Music will be available from the end of 
 October - email <a href="mailto:projects@fnb.nl">projects@fnb.nl</a> . And a free email newsletter on accessible music is available  from the FNB Talking Music project site:
 <a href="http://projects.fnb.nl/Talking%20Music">http://projects.fnb.nl/Talking%20Music</a>

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Batcane Due By January.</h3>
<p> 
 The 'Batcane', a cane for vision-impaired people that uses echo-location, is due to go on sale 
 to a global market by the beginning of next year after almost two years of trials by user 
 groups in four countries.
</p>
<p> 
 The cane is the result of a collaboration between independent technology company 
 Cambridge Consulting (<a href="http://www.cambridgeconsultants.com">http://www.cambridgeconsultants.com</a>
) and Sound ForesightLtd,  (<a href="http://www.soundforesight.co.uk">http://www.soundforesight.co.uk</a>
), an assistive technologies company founded in  collaboration with the University of Leeds. It won 'Design application of the year' at the 
 European Electronic Industry Awards on 24 September 
 (<a href="http://www.electronicsweekly.com/awards/">http://www.electronicsweekly.com/awards/</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The system works by bouncing ultrasound waves off objects close to the user, and detecting 
 the echoes. The information is then transferred to software which interprets it as a distance 
 between user and object and sends a vibration to four pads on the handle of the cane which 
 relate to the space above, behind and to each side of the user. The vibration begins as a pulse 
 and intensifies the closer it moves to an object.
</p>
<p> 
 "Testers found and identified street furniture without walking into it", says Jane Fowler, 
 project manager at Sound Foresight. "It's been successful from the point of view that
 feedback has been so consistent. It has been very well received". The collapsible long-cane, 
 which runs on two AA batteries, will go on the market after trials in the UK, Canada, 
 Germany and the US.
</p>
<p> 
 However, Peter Hings, products and publications support service manager at the RNIB said 
 the manufacturers are still consulting with the RNIB due to "some fundamental design
 faults". He said, "It picks up objects. It's good at picking up gaps and objects probably better
 than any other product of its kind on the market but so far, at a very slow walking pace".
</p>
<p> 
 Batcanes will be on sale for 399 pounds via the Sound Foresight Ltd web site, the RNIB and other
 vision-impairment organisations. "Four-hundred pounds is still a lot of money when you think
 a standard cane costs 25 pounds 50", says Hings. The Bat-cane continues to be tested by the
 RNIB until its launch.
</p>
<h3 id="i45-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: TECHSHARE:</h3>
<p>  LEARNING, WORK AND LIFE </p>
<p> 
 'Thanks to technology, people with sight problems are better off than they were ten years 
 ago." Such will be the topic of a new-format large-scale debate at this year's major UK
 conference on technologies for the vision-impaired, Techshare, hosted by the RNIB 
 (<a href="http://www.techshare.org.uk">http://www.techshare.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The conference, sponsored this year by Microsoft, will focus on the themes of learning, work 
 and life. 
</p>
<p> 
 "There are always a lot of product developers present so this year we are going to balance that 
 with people speaking about user experience", a spokesperson said. The results of a survey of 
 blind and partially sighted people in the UK on their current use of, and attitudes towards 
 technology will be presented to delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 Other presentation topics will cover the internet; e-learning; and making music and for the 
 first time, there will also be the pre-conference workshop 'Techshare for Teachers' sponsored
 by government agency for technologyion, Becta. This will include presentations from five 
 technology practitioners in the field of education for pupils under 16 with impaired vision and 
 blindness.
</p>
<p> 
 Also new to the event the latest projects, products and services for the vision-impaired will be 
 shown in the form of informal 'coffee table' demonstrations, including a new mobile phone 
 for vision-impaired users from Spain, OWASYS. Techshare is held on 20-21 November 2003 
 at Jury's Inn, Birmingham and costs 180 pounds per person or 120 pounds for one day.

 impairment, especially the physical characteristics of the card by way of the surface graphics 
 and the possibility of adding a simple Braille ID label. Also, are there issues surrounding use 
 of photographs on such cards?
</p>
<p> 
 "Typical providers providing discounted services would include libraries, for charged-for
 services such as CD or cassette loans; leisure centres; bus passes and retailers. The card 
 would also act as a single source proof of identity when claiming housing or council tax

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: ANALYSIS- ACCESSIBILITY.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: RAISING THE STAKES.by David Kreps  <a href="mailto:david@fourquarters.biz">david@fourquarters.biz</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Local councils and fire authorities in England are currently embroiled in the third round of 
 'implementing electronic government' statements (IEG3) - an annual task to record and
 demonstrate the progress they have made with e-government, and their plans for future 
 improvements. 
</p>
<p> 
 When the draft proforma for IEG3 returns was published for consultation early in the 
 summer, among its proposed targets were that minimum standards of accessibility for council 
 web sites should be set at level 'A', the lowest of three standard levels of accessibility
 specified by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
) undertaken by the World Web Consortium. The higher levels specified in the WAI web content accessibility 
 guidelines are 'AA' and 'AAA'.
</p>
<p> 
 However, in the final IEG3 guidelines released in July, for return by 10 November, the 
 government raised the stakes and set the minimum standard at level 'AA'. This upgrading of
 the standard will have a major impact on councils' web strategies.
</p>
<p> 
 It is relatively easy to upgrade most sites to level 'A' standards. Minimum requirements to
 achieve this include to ensure there are alternative text 'tags' in the code behind all graphical
 material, and to write basic HTML mark-up for speech synthesisers. The latter ranges from 
 the simple - like marking-up natural language changes so phrases like "c'est la vie" and
 names like "Javier Solana" are pronounced by speech synthesisers as you would expect - to
 the more arcane, for example using special HTML tags that give basic co-ordinates for those 
 listening to a web page with which to navigate data in a table.
</p>
<p> 
 Level 'AA' standards require much more, however. What is needed here is a fundamental
 change in working practices for web authors, towards allowing the users of their web sites to 
 determine how pages are displayed.  This is achieved by using a 'style sheet' alongside the
 HTML pages, containing the specifications for all visual formatting: and visitors with their 
 own preferences can then simply substitute their own style sheet.  
</p>
<p> 
 This change in working practices for web authors involves three fundamental requirements: to 
 adhere to current World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) HTML code standards; to adopt the 
 principle of fluid design; and to cater for people unable to use a mouse.
</p>
<p> 
 The first of these requirements implies perhaps the greatest change, requiring web authors to 
 unlearn much of what they are used to and adopt whole new ways of doing things. They will 
 need to retrain to apply style sheets and web accessibility techniques, and entire new web 
 maintenance and updating strategies are likely to be needed to keep the site accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The second requirement - for fluid design - makes the final break from print-based design,
 requiring web developers to create pages which the end user can see the way they want to see 
 them, and not solely as determined by the designer.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, it is important that anyone navigating without a mouse - be it with keyboard
 shortcuts or a TV remote - is not excluded from the very services from which they are most
 likely to benefit.  Many browsers for the visually impaired, for example, scan web pages for 
 hyperlinks and present them all at the top of the page. Taken out of context in this way, a link 
 which is entitled simply "click here" means nothing. There are also UK Government
 Standards for use of the HTML tag "accesskey" which enables users to press, for example,
 Alt+0 and Enter, on their keyboard, to navigate to the webpage that has the list of which 
 accesskeys apply to which page - typically Alt+1 for Home, and so on.
</p>
<p> 
 The effect of these changes on transactional sites - those which allow council tax payments
 for example - is likely to be profound, and a strategy for compliance has to be ready in the
 short timescale of the IEG3 return.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, recent research undertaken by web designers Gez Lemon and Jane Wilcock 
 and published by Accessify (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/accessify">http://fastlink.headstar.com/accessify</a>
) shows most local  authorities are likely to score badly on this issue. In fact at the time of this research, the 
 authors found only a single council web site that was properly accessible. E-government 
 officers take note - the clock is ticking.

 show whether sites are accessible or not. We have around 400,000 regular users and 
 we wanted to provide a place they could discuss these issues, because it's so
 important to e-business."
</p>
<p> 
 The second site, Accessify Forum, has already attracted nearly 2,000 contributions 
 since it launched two weeks ago. Administrator Nigel Peck told EAB: "We felt the 
 web needed a set of forums dedicated to discussing accessibility alone, rather than as 
 one of many design topics covered. This way we can cover all the related issues 
 without danger of them being lost and cluttered by other topics."
</p>
<p> 
 Interestingly, both sites use the free, open source 'phpBB' discussion software 
 interface (<a href="http://www.phpbb.com">http://www.phpbb.com</a>
) because it was robust, popular with other similar  sites and offers plenty of useful features. However, the interface appears to be raising 
 its own accessibility issues.
</p>
<p> 
 With nice circularity, Accessify has set up a forum specifically to improve the 
 accessibility of the forum itself, and is working towards making it compliant with the 
 highest international standards. "Once we've brought the software up to standard I
 will be releasing the code to enable others to do the same thing," Peck said.
</p>
<p> 
 Garrett French at WebProWorld said his site would also be looking at ways to 
 improve the interface: "I don't believe this software was designed with accessibility in
 mind." One forum user has already recommended adding subject and message body 
 label tags to the online forms used by the software to input messages, and adding tags 
 to the text formatting buttons.
</p>
<p> 
 Both sites are based in the US and are generating lively discussion about 'section 508', 
 a 1998 amendment to the country's Rehabilitation Act requiring government web and 
 other technology projects to be accessible, even where these are outsourced to 
 suppliers.
</p>
<p> 
 "Right now in the US only government websites have to be accessible," said French. 
 "Some of our members feel the government should step in and demand that all sites 
 become so. However most people seem to feel the changes should be voluntary."
</p>
<p> 
 One WebProWorld forum user says: "I have used screen access technology almost 
 since it was first introduced. I think that, just as with anything, training is the key. If 
 accessibility programming is including in programming courses, then people will do 
 the right thing."
</p>
<p> 
 Another says: "I now look at web accessibility very differently. It's not just about
 catering for blind people, it benefits everyone. Sites that follow the guidelines, even in 
 a small way, are improving their overall usability."
</p>
<p> 
 It is not always a simple matter. At AccessifyForum, one recent contributor says: 
 "Making your site accessible can seem like an impossible mission. The problem is 
 that even validation tools like Bobby can only cover things which can be tested, like 
 images and forms having the right tags. They can't test for readability, like contrast
 between text and background colour. Getting the validation logo saying "well done"
 is only part of the process."
</p>
<p> 
 There is a positive message as well however: "There is so much involved when you 
 look at the overall picture, but if you take it a step at a time you will soon work it 
 out."
