<h3 id="i39-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Planned Eu Directive To Ban Technology Discrimination.</h3>
<p> 
 Proposed EU rules banning discrimination against disabled users of
 media, telecommunication and online
 services have been unveiled this month by European disability groups,
 which hope the provisions will pass
 into law by the end of this year.
</p>
<p> 
 The draft directive would require all private and public bodies to
 deliver their internet services in accessible
 formats, and all telecommunications services to be made accessible
 within five years.
</p>
<p> 
 The measures form part of a broad anti-discrimination initiative
 developed by the umbrella lobby group the
 European Disability Forum (EDF -
 <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm">http://www.edf-feph.org/en/welcome.htm</a>
) with the European Parliament Disability Intergroup (<a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/apdg/index-en.htm">http://www.edf-feph.org/apdg/index-en.htm</a>
), an informal grouping of MEPs working
 on disability policy.
</p>
<p> 
 If passed, the rules would represent the first European move to
 prohibit discrimination against the disabled
 across multiple sectors and services including the workplace,
 healthcare, social services, education, goods,
 facilities, services and product design. At present, most
 anti-discrimination law in EU member states is
 contained in provisions which form part of broader laws governing areas
 such as transport, education or
 social security.
</p>
<p> 
 The law would also introduce enforcement procedures, including the
 right for people with disabilities to go
 to court in any EU member state.
</p>
<p> 
 "We expect changes will be made to the draft in the next stage, where
 it is considered by the European
 Commission directorate concerned with employment and social affairs.
 But the draft has been two years in
 the making and we have been very careful not to exceed the powers of
 European institutions. We hope the
 commission will give its support," an EDF spokesperson said this week.
</p>
<h3 id="i39-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Education Support Database Goes Live.</h3>
<p> 
 Students with disabilities can check what kinds of accessibility and
 support facilities and services are
 provided for them by colleges and universities in 17 European countries
 with the Higher Education
 Accessibility Guide (HEAG - <a href="http://www.heagnet.org">http://www.heagnet.org</a>
), a European Commission-funded service that
 launched earlier this month.
</p>
<p> 
 HEAG users can access online information resources on each country or
 find telephone contacts for
 educational and government bodies. In the UK section, users can search
 for all colleges and universities that
 provide syllabuses or books in alternative formats such as Braille,
 large print, tape or disk.
</p>
<p> 
 Most institutions have provided links to their web sites together with
 contact information for disability
 advisers. "The idea is to provide people with a general idea of what is
 available," said a spokesperson for the
 education and employment charity Skill (<a href="http://www.skill.org.uk">http://www.skill.org.uk</a>
), the UK partner in the HEAG project.
 According to Skill, a student needing information about a specific
 course should contact university disability
 advisers directly.
</p>
<h3 id="i39-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Call For Un Action On Technology Access.</h3>
<p> 
 An urgent call for the United Nations to build basic technology
 accessibility rules into their development
 programmes was launched last week at an international meeting in the
 Philippines, attended by
 representatives of ten Asian countries, the US and Canada.
</p>
<p> 
 The event, 'empowering persons with disabilities through ICT'
 (<a href="http://www.worldenable.net/manila2003">http://www.worldenable.net/manila2003</a>
), was organised by 'WorldEnable' (<a href="http://www.worldenable.net">http://www.worldenable.net</a>
), an international accessibility consortium
 developed by Canadian company Vision Office
 (<a href="http://www.visionoffice.com">http://www.visionoffice.com</a>
) and US social sector consultancy AIMS (<a href="http://www.intlmgt.com">http://www.intlmgt.com</a>
). It was supported by the Philippine government and the United
 Nations department of social and economic affairs.
</p>
<p> 
 The problems of access to technology in the developing world are
 particularly acute because of lack of funds
 and training, so people with disabilities faced even more severe
 problems unless action is taken, the
 conference heard. A joint statement from delegates called on the UN to
 undertake a global study on norms
 and standards for technology accessibility in the developing world;
 develop a pilot web site accessibility
 assessment tool for use in a development context; and develop relevant
 training and resource materials
 usable by poorer nations.
</p>
<p> 
 Cynthia Waddell, director of the US-based centre for disability
 resources on the internet
 (<a href="http://www.icdri.org">http://www.icdri.org</a>
) and co-facilitator of the conference, said: "The call from Manila is for a minimum
 threshold worldwide for accessible design of all technologies in
 general, and of web technology in
 particular."
</p>
<p> 
 Waddell said the remit of an existing UN committee on rights of people
 with disabilities
 (<a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/disA56168e1.htm">http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/disA56168e1.htm</a>
), which is working towards a global convention,
 could be expanded to specifically mention accessible design of
 technology.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Audible E-Greetings From Bafta-Nominated Site.</h3>
<p> 
 A set of audible 'e-greetings cards' accessible to visually impaired
 people (<a href="http://www.yrguk.com/poetry">http://www.yrguk.com/poetry</a>
) has been launched by the UK Audio Network, a free resource created by
 accessibility enthusiast Bill Teale.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can choose from 25 poems grouped by themes such as 'humour' and
 'birthday', which are played
 using the Real Audio standard and are compatible with major types of
 screen reader software. Using number
 keys for navigation, audio instructions lead the user through options,
 which include sending a personalised
 message with a poem.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK Audio Network site (<a href="http://www.yrguk.com">http://www.yrguk.com</a>
) also provides links to online radio stations, news,
 sports commentary, interactive audio quizzes and games for visually
 impaired people. In 2002 the site and
 was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award
 for accessible interactive
 entertainment (<a href="http://www.bafta.org/interactive">http://www.bafta.org/interactive</a>
), to the astonishment of Teale, who runs the entire operation
 unfunded, from his bedroom in Halifax.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: CONFERENCE PREVIEW- CSUN 2003.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: MOBILE HIGHLIGHTS FOR TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASEby Derek Parkinson  <a href="mailto:derek@headstar.com">derek@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The largest annual global showcase of new technology for people with
 disabilities, staged at California State
 University (CSUN -  <a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf</a>
), opens on Monday and runs for six days.
</p>
<p> 
 Topics of interest to the visual impairment community this year include
 developments in mobile computing;
 educational games; and the latest thinking on technology training.
</p>
<p> 
 The conference, which will receive visitors from more than 35
 countries, will feature a keynote speech by
 technology pioneer Ray Kurzweil, who pioneered reading machines for
 visually impaired people (see
 <a href="http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html">http://www.kurzweiltech.com/aboutray.html</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The mobile technology highlights will include the unveiling of new
 capabilities for the PAC Mate, a
 handheld computer made by Freedom Scientific that combines a JAWS
 screenreader, browser, email,
 calendar, contacts and document functions (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun1</a>
). The company will demonstrate how to connect PAC Mate - which uses the Microsoft Pocket
 PC operating system - to a mobile
 phone, printer or home computer using Bluetooth wireless technology. It
 will also preview future models.
</p>
<p> 
 Pulse Data will demonstrate KeyWeb, an accessible web-browser for the
 company's mobile BrailleNote
 notetakers and other devices; and KeySync, which enables accessible
 mobile access to Microsoft Outlook
 email software (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun2</a>
). The company is also expected to demonstrate new
 multilingual capabilities of these products.
</p>
<p> 
 VisuAide, a developer of advanced audio products, will demonstrate
 Victor Trekker, which combines GPS
 satellite connectivity with audio navigation guides (see
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun3</a>
). The company will also release a new, lower cost version of its Victor Classic
 e-book reader
 (<a href="http://www.visuaide.com/victorclassic.html">http://www.visuaide.com/victorclassic.html</a>
). The device retains full functionality and a rechargeable
 battery pack, but the power transformer has moved from inside the
 player onto the power cord to reduce its
 weight when used with batteries. E-Access Bulletin would like to
 correct a statement implying reduced
 functionality for this device carried in our last issue.
</p>
<p> 
 GW Micro will announce the inclusion of a Macromedia Flash online
 animation reader for their leading
 Window-Eyes screen-reader, which can also now access multimedia content
 in formats used by Real Audio
 players (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun4</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile Freedom Scientific and others will demonstrate how the latest
 version of its JAWS for Windows
 screenreader can navigate forms, tables and frames on web pages
 (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun5">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun5</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 As in previous years, training and education will be a key theme, and
 this year a European Commission-
 funded project exploring educational online games for children is
 likely to stir particular interest. The Tactile
 Interactive Multimedia (TIM) project intends to develop and to adapt
 computer games, making them
 accessible through devices like tactile boards, Braille displays or
 speech synthesisers. Children as young as
 three will be able to navigate through sound environments to boost
 their academic and social or emotional
 learning (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun6">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun6</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Among others, the session will examine 'Reader rabbits', an adaptation
 of a mainstream discovery game
 designed for very young children; 'MudSplat', where the player defeats
 mud throwing monsters by squirting
 water at them; 'Tim's journey', an exploration game where the player
 solves a mystery by exploring a sound
 environment; and 'X-tune', a musical game where the player can sequence
 and play with different sound
 environments. 'TiM's Magic dictation' is a educational game for
 learning reading and writing.
</p>
<p> 
 New ways of teaching music will be explored by technology developer
 Dancing Dots in a session
 showcasing its Speech-Assisted Learning product
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun7">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun7</a>
). SAL works by placing a standard page of embossed braille over a flat touch-screen.
 When the student presses on a Braille
 character, SAL responds with auditory feedback. The system also
 incorporates a Braille keyboard, a
 synthetic speech engine and an audio file player. After completion of a
 set activity, the product can report
 the results to a tutor.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, a session led by Harris Rosensweig of the Royal New Zealand
 Foundation for the Blind; Steve Tyler
 of the RNIB and Shan Sasser of the Iowa Department for the Blind will
 assess the viability of forming an
 international consortium that will provide professionals from around
 the world with a resource for
 information and training materials on providing computer training to
 blind, visually impaired, or deafblind
 individuals (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun8">http://fastlink.headstar.com/csun8</a>
). The session will discuss the approaches and materials
 currently used by the three organisations.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: FOCUS- THE ARTS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: PAINTINGS THAT SPEAK VOLUMESby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Many museums and galleries are seeking to enhance access to exhibitions
 for visually impaired visitors by
 combining tactile experience with use of technologies such as web sites
 and audio guides.
</p>
<p> 
 The National Gallery web site for example, since January 2003, has
 featured an online zooming system
 whereby users can enlarge details of paintings such as Van Gogh's
 'Sunflowers'
 (<a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/news/newsitems/zoom.htm">http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/news/newsitems/zoom.htm</a>
). And recent exhibitions at
 Newcastle's Laing Art Gallery have incorporated relief versions of
 paintings by artists such as Stanley
 Spencer with accompanying audio descriptions, some of which remain as
 permanent exhibits.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem with many of these services, however, arise from a lack of
 detail in visual descriptions issued
 through audio channels. One regular gallery visitor with a visual
 impairment told E-Access Bulletin that
 audio description often comes over as superficial and lacking in
 detail. "I would love to have the textures,
 perspectives and information about techniques explained to me," she
 said. "These are the kinds of details
 sighted people absorb unconsciously. I want to be able to feel the
 depth of a painting."
</p>
<p> 
 To explore such issues further and examine possible solutions, the Arts
 Council is funding 'Talking images,'
 a project to interview around 300 visually impaired people to discover
 and analyse their attitudes towards
 museum and gallery visits. Another strand of the 18-month project - run
 by RNIB with accessible arts
 charity VocalEyes (<a href="http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk">http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk</a>
) - is sending 12 visually impaired 'auditors' to around 50
 cultural institutions to test the accessibility of their audio guides.
</p>
<p> 
 Some galleries are already attempting to set the pace for accessible
 art. Tate Britain
 (<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/britain">http://www.tate.org.uk/britain</a>
) provides a service whereby visitors can feel mock-up canvases of paintings
 by artists such as Jackson Pollock and handle sculptures. It also began
 last month to offer free audio
 description tours in association with VocalEyes using new, lightweight
 hand sets. In future, the Tate is
 aiming to create an audio description 'bank' online, which rotates
 according to changing displays.
</p>
<p> 
 The British Museum's Compass project
 (<a href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass">http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass</a>
), a web site containing images of and information about 5,000 key artefacts, has
 also been made accessible for visually
 impaired people. Users can change the text size, style and colour
 through browser settings and view a text
 only version of the service (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/museum1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/museum1</a>
). Besides Compass, which last year
 won the National Library of the Blind's visionary design award
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nlbuk1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nlbuk1</a>
), a terminal for audio-described literature about the museum's collections
 was installed in the museum's
 reading room last month.
</p>
<p> 
 Compass project manager Matthew Cock told E-Access Bulletin: "People
 are realising that to start an
 accessible site is not just a question of making a text-only option,
 but that accessibility for visually impaired
 people should pervade the whole site. Not to do so is like only putting
 a wheelchair ramp round the back of a
 building."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FIVE: BANKING- TALKING CASH MACHINES.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCEby Julia Schofield  <a href="mailto:julia.schofield@jsc.co.uk">julia.schofield@jsc.co.uk</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Australia, Canada and the US currently lead the world in the
 development of talking 'ATMs' (automated
 teller machines) at banks, for visually impaired customers (see
 E-Access Bulletin, issue 31, July 2002, story
 16).
</p>
<p> 
 In Australia, two banking groups - National Australia Bank, and Westpac
 which incorporates Bank of
 Melbourne and Challenge Bank - have been the first to deploy the
 systems in selected locations, and earlier
 this year I had the chance to assess one of these cash machines in
 Melbourne.
</p>
<p> 
 The idea is to provide fully independent access to the ATM for people
 with poor or no sight. The ATMs
 used by Bank of Melbourne are manufactured by NCR and are available for
 normal use, with additions to
 make them 'talk'. The main external changes are some transparent
 Braille labelling and a walkman-type
 audio socket beneath a small sliding cover.
</p>
<p> 
 Whenever visually impaired customers enquire about the system, they
 should be directed to a bank that has a
 talking machine. Staff in these branches have been trained in how to
 show people with poor or no sight the
 machine and are instructed too that they must cover how to find it from
 the entrance - the present machines
 are inside the bank.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessible ATMs must be positioned near a door in a location where
 someone can easily find it, for example
 by following a wall along a route that does not have furniture or
 queues of people in the way.
</p>
<p> 
 The first time the talking ATM is used, a member of staff at the bank
 will accompany the visually impaired
 person to ensure they understand how it works. At this short training
 session, they provide a small earpiece
 with a hook to attach it to the ear so that both hands are free, but
 subsequently it is most convenient for users
 to bring their own earpiece. In Melbourne, staff training is provided
 by the Royal Victorian Institute for the
 Blind.
</p>
<p> 
 On the machine itself, slots have been marked in Braille with what they
 are (for example "cash", "receipt",
 "card"). A jack socket has been placed under a small cover so that the
 headphone can be plugged in.
</p>
<p> 
 The keyboard has tactile markings - the '5' key is marked with a raised
 bump, as with a telephone, and the
 'enter' and 'clear' keys have additional markings. And then, of course,
 there are the spoken instructions -
 the element that makes it a 'talking' machine.
</p>
<p> 
 To hear the instructions, the customer plugs in their earpiece.
 Instantly the machine introduces how it works
 in brief, good quality speech. It invites the customer to put in their
 card, describing the orientation - "place
 your card in the slot marked 'card' with the raised printing uppermost
 and to the left".
</p>
<p> 
 The customer is next asked to type their card number on the keypad and
 press 'Enter' (they are told this key
 is next to the 9 and it has a tactile marker). The 'Clear' button is
 also described, in case of error. For
 withdrawal of cash, the customer is asked to press 1 for 20 Australian
 dollars, 2 for 50 dollars, 3 for 100
 dollars and so on. When there is a pause, a message reassures the user
 that their transaction is being
 processed.
</p>
<p> 
 Whether the customer wants a receipt is also confirmed with keystrokes
 on the numbers and the customer is
 told to remove their card then take the money and receipt. Other
 transactions work in a similar way and if a
 balance is requested then this is given through the earpiece, which
 ensures the information remains secure.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, the machine was very usable. The audio instructions were
 carefully worded, and the assistance I
 received from staff was efficient, sensitive and extremely clear.
 Machines such as this represent a major step
 forward in financial independence for visually impaired people.
