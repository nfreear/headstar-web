<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION ONE: NEWS.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i46-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Uk To Pioneer Location-Based Services.</h3>
<p> 
 A UK-based research consortium is undertaking a pioneering project to
 develop location-based services for people with mobility problems.
 The project, called LBS4ALL, will exploit new mobile computing,
 global positioning and communication technologies to aid navigation
 for older, visually impaired and blind people in urban environments.
</p>
<p> 
 The project's partners are the Department of Information Science
 (<a href="http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/organisation/is/">http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/organisation/is/</a>
) and the Centre for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Design (<a href="http://www-hcid.soi.city.ac.uk">http://www-hcid.soi.city.ac.uk</a>
) at City University, London; the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology at
 Kings College, London (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/kings1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/kings1</a>
); the mapping agency Ordnance Survey (<a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk">http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk</a>
); and the RNIB (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
). It is funded until January 2006 by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the
 Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
</p>
<p> 
 Location-based services, which use knowledge about where a person is
 located to deliver relevant information to a mobile device, could offer
 blind and vision-impaired people far greater independence of
 movement. "At the moment blind and visually impaired people have to
 plan every journey meticulously and can't really be dropped into a new
 environment," says Kevin Carey, honorary research fellow at the
 Centre for HCI Design. "A location-based service could allow them to
 be more spontaneous in their movements and give them greater
 freedom and autonomy."
</p>
<p> 
 LBS4ALL has four strategic objectives: to develop applications to
 deliver maps, navigation, directions and other information to mobile
 devices such as smart phones; to develop a wearable mobility aid using
 an earpiece for aural communication; to create maps offering a
 "walking eye view" of areas, including localised elements such as
 pavements and pillar boxes; and to work with commercial
 organisations such as mobile phone companies.
</p>
<p> 
 "We see location-based services as complementing the use of canes or
 guide dogs among the blind and visually impaired," says Jonathan
 Raper, professor of geographic information science at City University.
 "Micro navigation - avoiding banging into low branches or stepping
 down a manhole - will be covered by existing mobility aids. But by
 developing new mobile navigation applications, we hope to give the
 blind and visually impaired greater freedom."
</p>
<h3 id="i46-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessible Formats Copyright Law Enacted.</h3>
<p> 
 A law will come into force next week allowing UK schools, libraries
 and non-profit organisations to provide accessible versions of printed
 materials to vision-impaired people without having to receive
 permission from the rights holders.
</p>
<p> 
 The law applies to the production of books in accessible formats by
 individual vision-impaired people, schools, colleges and non-profit
 bodies.
</p>
<p> 
 The Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/copy1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/copy1</a>
), which comes into force on 31 October, says if a non-profit or educational organisation has the master
</p>
<p> 
 copy of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, it does not
 infringe copyright for them to make or supply accessible copies for
 "vision impaired persons to whom the master copy is not accessible
 because of their impairment".
</p>
<p> 
 This means vision-impaired people will receive accessible copies of
 books in weeks, not months as is commonplace under current
 arrangements for distribution of accessible versions through a handful
 of authorised bodies such as the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Barbara Stratton, copyright adviser at the Chartered
 Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP -
 <a href="http://www.cilip.org.uk">http://www.cilip.org.uk</a>
), "no-one may derive any profit from making an accessible copy but a charge may be made to the user".
</p>
<p> 
 "It is very positive that [the law] doesn't specify the format, it just
 talks about making an accessible format" says RNIB campaigns officer
 David Mann. "The only significant limitation is if an equivalent
 accessible version exists commercially", he said, since the law only
 allows for vision-impaired people to obtain accessible versions of
 materials if one does not already exist.
</p>
<h3 id="i46-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Web Design Body Embraces Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 The British Web Design and Marketing Association (BWDMA -
 <a href="http://www.bwdma.com">http://www.bwdma.com</a>
) has formed a new usability and accessibility working group to combat the exclusion of people with disabilities from
 the internet. The group, which will hold its first meeting in London in
 early November, has attracted 18 members to date, including
 professionals from the blind and deaf communities, academics and
 industry professionals.
</p>
<p> 
 The association aims to devise practical initiatives to stimulate greater
 adoption of usability and accessibility practices in the digital economy.
 It wants to simplify these issues for web owners and web developers
 who it says are confused by - or oblivious to - current legislation
 relating to accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act, which came into effect in
 October 1999, stipulates that service providers must make "reasonable"
 adjustments to ensure their services are accessible to disabled people.
 The association says awareness of the Act is particularly low among
 large corporations.
</p>
<p> 
 "When you mention usability and accessibility to some companies,
 they have visions of text-only web sites which will ruin their corporate
 branding," says Leonie Watson, acting chair for the working group and
 usability and accessibility consultant for the digital design company
 Nomensa (<a href="http://www.nomensa.com">http://www.nomensa.com</a>
). "But you don't have to sacrifice accessibility for creativity. We want to reassure businesses that they
 can have all the bells and whistles while making their sites accessible
 to a greater number of people."
</p>
<p> 
 One of the items on the agenda for November's meeting will be to
 discuss the merits of an accreditation scheme for web suppliers with
 expertise in usability and accessibility. This would provide a valuable
 resource for corporate and government purchasers and give web
 developers something to aim for, says Watson.
</p>
<h3 id="i46-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Politicians Promote Benefits Of E-Voting.</h3>
<p> 
 A meeting this week of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs)
 and election officials to discuss accessible voting in the 2004 European
 Parliament elections could pave the way for a series of co-ordinated
 studies to assess the benefits of e-voting for people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The European Parliament Disability Intergroup (EPDI -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/epdi1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/epdi1</a>
) met in Strasbourg to discuss past and present experiments with e-voting, and to lay foundations for
 sharing knowledge and good practices in future.
</p>
<p> 
 "It seems intuitively likely that e-voting is a positive thing for people
 with disabilities, because it enables them to vote independently and in
 privacy," said MEP Richard Howitt, president of EPDI. "But we need
 more hard evidence to support this," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Howitt, the meeting discussed the planned UK e-voting
 pilots for the May 2004 elections to the European Parliament, and
 heard from representatives of the UK Electoral Commission
 (<a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk">http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk</a>
). "The Commission welcomed the suggestion that it could go back to its unpublished data
 and look for evidence, and to take part in evaluations in other EU
 countries," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 At present there is little political will to mandate e-voting across
 Europe, according to Howitt. However, EPDI will continue to promote
 best practice in evaluating its impact on people with disabilities.

<h3 id="i46-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: GOVERNMENT STANDARDS:</h3>
<p>  Following last month's news piece 'Web standards mismatched?' describing the government's
 decision to raise council web site standards to a minimum 'AA'
 requirement, Vicki Cookson of the RNIB writes in to clarify the
 organisation's position.
</p>
<p> 
 "We welcome the government's decision to raise the accessibility bar
 to AA," she says. "This is the strongest signal yet that it is truly
 committed to making the UK's web presence one of the most
 accessible in the world.
</p>
<p> 
 "Local authority web site managers should be reassured that RNIB
 offers an auditing service to AA standard. This has not been widely
 publicised until now, as there has been little demand for it beyond the
 assessment of individual templates. However, we'll be happy to
 renegotiate the terms of any impending audit.
</p>
<p> 
 "To set the See it Right audit in context, we're confident that the WAI
 checkpoints covered in our standard represent best practice
 accessibility in the real world of the web - the standard includes the
 checkpoints which we believe are realistic, achievable and have the
 highest impact on the accessibility of a website.
</p>
<p> 
 "To qualify for the See it Right logo, websites must achieve a standard
 of accessibility exceeding WAI single A and close to WAI AA. See it
 Right incorporates nearly all WAI priority one checkpoints, as well as
 a range of priority two and three checkpoints which have particular
 relevance to users with sight problems.

<h3 id="i46-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: CHINESE STARS:</h3>
<p>  Last issue Fernando Botelho, Technical Development Director of the eSight Careers Network
 (<a href="http://www.eSightCareers.Net">http://www.eSightCareers.Net</a>
), wrote in with a request for information on materials to give someone who is blind access to
 Chinese.
</p>
<p> 
 It turns out that our indefatigable inbox contributor Chris McMillan,
 with Stephen Hallett, runs a charity called China Vision
 (<a href="http://www.xanadutv.com/chinavision.html">http://www.xanadutv.com/chinavision.html</a>
) to assist vision-impaired people in China.
</p>
<p> 
 She recommends the World Radio Network's china programmes,
 which include a language series, and also has a valuable personal
 contact: "Mr Ye Zijie, a blind man living in Huhhot, Inner Mongolia, is
 one of the visually impaired Chinese people with whom I correspond
 regularly and who has visited the UK to learn computer and other
 western skills," she writes. "Ye is also a teacher in a school for the
 blind, and would like to help Fernando learn mandarin."
</p>
<p> 
 And some advice from Ye Zijie himself: "There are several types of
 software containing electronic dictionaries for blind people, with
 voices in both English and Chinese. The software I use is called
 QingHua ShuangXing (in English the name is QingHua Double Stars).
 This software was created by Professor Mao YuHang at QingHua
 University in Beijing. It cost around 90 English Pounds, and the
 electronic dictionary I bought is around 50 English Pounds."

<p>  Steve Richards has a query about flat-screen computer monitors. "I am thinking about getting a TFT (thin-film
 transistor) monitor. However, I use Zoomtext as a magnifying glass on
 my monitor which I have set to cover about a quarter of the screen
 area.
</p>
<p> 
 "When I experimented with it on my wife's old laptop, I found that as I
 moved the magnifier across the screen the image beneath it just died
 and then came back as I brought the magnifier to rest. This is no good
 because I cannot see where I wish to get to as the image has faded. My
 wife says that the fading image is a sort of blurring which gives the
 impression that it has faded. My big question is: Is this to do with
 refresh rates and would a more modern TFT prevent this problem? It is
 useless trying to get any help from places like PC World! [Responses

<p>  Sondra Billings of the John Innes Centre (<a href="http://www.jic.bbsrc.ac.uk">http://www.jic.bbsrc.ac.uk</a>
), a botanical research institute, says there is a "gap in the market" in the UK for basic accessibility training for
 people who are not web experts.
</p>
<p> 
 "I should think that there are many other people like myself who have
 a communications background rather than a computing background but
 have still been asked to take on web management responsibilities. I
 [have searched on the web] for tutorials and background reading but
 this only takes a novice so far down the road to a full understanding of
 accessibility. Are list members aware of any hands-on training for web
 accessibility, particularly for the novice level, available in the UK?"
</p>
<h3 id="i46-14"><b class="Ps">+</b>14: INTERIM MANAGEMENT:</h3>
<p>  Finally Dave Williams, Interim Director, ACB Radio (<a href="http://www.acbradio.org">http://www.acbradio.org</a>
), writes in to correct a small inaccuracy in our September 'inbox' about ACB radio, an
 international resource run by the American Council for the Blind.
</p>
<p> 
 The piece stated that Jonathan Mosen was responsible for the running
 of ACB Radio, but in fact he stepped down in July, and Williams
 himself has been in charge since then on an interim basis. The ACB is
 now seeking a permanent replacement:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: INTERVIEW- PETER BARKER OBE.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>15: BUILDING BRIDGESby Phil Cain  <a href="mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 "A number of things in life change when you can't see any more," says
 Peter Barker, visiting professor at Reading University's research group
 for inclusive environments
 (<a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/ie/staff/peterbarker/pb.htm">http://www.rdg.ac.uk/ie/staff/peterbarker/pb.htm</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Less than 15 years ago Barker had good enough sight to drive a car, as
 he held down a high-powered job as a director in a building and
 construction materials company. Soon afterwards however, his failing
 sight meant he could no longer drive, and keeping up with paperwork
 became almost impossible despite his use of a closed circuit television
 document magnification system.
</p>
<p> 
 But Barker's problems gave him a new perspective on the industry in
 which he had forged his career. As far as providing for the needs of the
 disabled, "I was probably doing it the wrong way," he says. And so he
 began to concentrate his efforts on researching ways to improve the
 navigability of buildings and transport systems.
</p>
<p> 
 In this new career - which would eventually see him awarded an OBE
 for services to the mobility of disabled people - his rare combination
 of personal and professional experience has proved greatly advantageous.
 "I can talk the same language [as architects] and can also speak with
 some credibility because they know I have personal experience of
 visual impairment," he says. One of his first research projects, Project
 Rainbow (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rainbow1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rainbow1</a>
), concentrated on the use of colour within a building.
</p>
<p> 
 The conclusions were startling. "When I started in the field there were
 people who said: "You need to talk about colour-contrasting important
 areas of a building and managing lighting levels." But what you really
 need to talk about what is 'effective' contrast and 'effective'
 lighting."
 In many cases, says Barker, it is hard to tell the difference between
 what is effective and what is ineffective.
</p>
<p> 
 The outcome was a way for architects to rate the effectiveness of
 colours they like and compare them to a definition for accepted levels
 of colour contrast. Part of this measurement technique has now been
 incorporated into British Standard BS8300 on accessible building
 design (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bs1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bs1</a>
) and government road vehicle accessibility regulations.
</p>
<p> 
 Barker's attention has now turned to trying to bring about changes for
 visually impaired people in physical mobility and access to
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 Barker is computer literate, using a computer by converting most text
 into speech but also using Braille. But like many who become blind
 later in life, he says he is not fluent in Braille. He has a desktop
 computer, a laptop and a 'Braille Lite' notetaker
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/fs1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/fs1</a>
), a portable computer with a Braille output and Braille keyboard with three keys on the left, three on the
 right and a space bar across the bottom. The Braille Lite can be used to
 download emails and read them in speech or Braille.
</p>
<p> 
 On a typical day he says he downloads his emails and newspapers and
 magazines sent by email by the Talking Newspapers Association UK
 (TNAUK - <a href="http://www.tnauk.org.uk">http://www.tnauk.org.uk</a>
), and reads them during his journey from his home in Tunbridge Wells to his London office. He
 also finds time to reply to emails so he can simply upload them on
 arrival at his office or hotel.
</p>
<p> 
 He regularly reads the Financial Times, the Guardian, Disability Now
 and New Scientist, but he complains the Daily Telegraph only arrives
 at 2pm because the paper's publisher is slow in sending the digital
 copy to TNAUK to be reformatted.
</p>
<p> 
 "I don't usually bother with the internet," he says, blaming the
 frustration caused by the inaccessibility of most web sites. But he is
 beginning to use it more often these days as people increasingly refer
 him to sites.
</p>
<p> 
 When wishing to recall recorded information he tends to rely mainly
 on speech output, because like many people who become blind later in
 life, his Braille is not fluent. "In a meeting I use an earphone. But it
 is sometimes hard to listen to what people are saying with one ear and
 what is in my notes with the other. On these occasions I tend to use
 Braille."
</p>
<p> 
 He does carry a mobile phone, but can't send text messages or use the
 directory of telephone numbers. "I only use a very small part of its
 capabilities." This is ironic since the mobile phone is meant to be a
 speech communication system. "It will change, I'm sure."
</p>
<p> 
 When asked to name the one thing about information technology
 which annoys him most, Barker returns to an early technology in need
 of improvement. "Why can't you hear the radio on the train when you
 go through a tunnel? You can when you drive through the Dartford
 tunnel." One feels that if Barker ever becomes involved in railway
 construction, such communications problems would soon be solved.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b> SECTION FOUR: FOCUS- WEB STANDARDS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>16: FIGHTING EUROPEAN FRAGMENTATIONby Mel Poluck  <a href="mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Although awareness of the need to make web sites accessible is now
 widespread in Europe, a large number of different guidelines, audit
 processes and testing tools exist within each country, creating a
 confusing hotchpotch of standards.
</p>
<p> 
 To address this problem, the European Accessibility Consortium
 (<a href="http://www.euroaccessibility.org">http://www.euroaccessibility.org</a>
) was launched in Paris in April this year.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 25 organisations from most European member states and some
 countries which are set to join the EU signed a memorandum of
 understanding to form the body at this year's annual conference of the
 French web portal for people with impaired vision, BrailleNet
 (<a href="http://www.braillenet.org">http://www.braillenet.org</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Although most accessibility tools are based around the international
 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative
 (WAI) guidelines, the founding members of the consortium noted that
 there was no harmonised methodology for implementation of the
 guidelines; no harmonised methodology for assessing the quality of
 web sites; and several different "labels" emerging to certify web
 accessibility. It was particularly important for European governments
 and other public sector bodies to be working to the same standards, the
 members said.
</p>
<p> 
 The idea is that eventually, popular accessibility checking tools such
 as Bobby, Ask Cynthia and LIFT would become compliant with the
 consortium's standards and receive certification to that effect.
</p>
<p> 
 But is there a potential of the consortium's work actually clashing with
 that of the W3C? "The W3C provide a very important base, they are
 internationally recognised," says  says Charles McCathieNevile
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Charles">http://www.w3.org/People/Charles</a>
) from Spain's Fundacion Sidar (<a href="http://www.sidar.org">http://www.sidar.org</a>
). "We don't want to change [the WAI guidelines], we'll provide input. It's very important to us that we're
 absolutely compatible and we're working with them, not against
 them".
</p>
<p> 
 However McCathieNevile says the new consortium is similar to the
 W3C in that "like them, we encourage participation". Indeed, the only
 prerequisites for an organisation to join are that they come from a
 European member state; are proposed for membership by a current
 member; and are willing to work. Members come from backgrounds
 ranging from private companies like IBM; research institutions like the
 University of the Aegean in Greece
 (<a href="http://www.aegean.gr/intro_en.htm">http://www.aegean.gr/intro_en.htm</a>
); and disability-related organisations such as the RNIB, one of three UK members.
</p>
<p> 
 It was important that the consortium's membership should embrace
 both large and small organisations, McCathieNevile said. "What your
 local school does may not be the same as what larger organisations do
 in terms of accessibility."
</p>
<p> 
 McCathieNevile is chair of the consortium's technical task force, one
 of five working groups charged with developing a common evaluation
 methodology providing consistent results for web accessibility testing
 across different countries and in different languages.
</p>
<p> 
 Last month, the task force held its first major technical meeting, out
 of which a working draft emerged of a European accessibility testing
 methodology, with further technical meetings to be hosted shortly in
 the UK by the RNIB. The draft will also be published on the
 consortium's web site, one of a series of actions to be taken to ensure
 there can be public participation in the body's work.
</p>
<p> 
 So, does the consortium seek to create a single way forward on
 accessibility to which all of Europe must comply? "Its not about
 pushing everyone into a box," McCathieNevile says. "We may be able
 to provide technical insight on what can work and what can't but
 [policy] is not our role.
</p>
<p> 
 "What we're doing is making sure that if you take 10,000 vision-
 impaired users across Europe and say 'this will work for you', they
 will know that the application of that standard is reliable, and that
 web accessibility will be the same in Czech Republic as it is in
 Denmark".
