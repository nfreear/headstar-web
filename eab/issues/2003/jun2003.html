<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessible Web Modules For Localgovernment.
</h3>
<p> 
 From March next year, all UK local authorities will be able to use a
 centrally-developed set of accessible web site components, following
 the release of 2.9 million pounds of government funding for the Local
 Authority Websites National Project
 (LAWS - <a href="http://www.laws-project.org.uk">http://www.laws-project.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 LAWS will develop web site technology that can handle public
 transactions in hundreds of service delivery categories, based on an
 architecture that encourages councils to build in usability and
 accessibility from the outset.
</p>
<p> 
 The project, which is being co-ordinated by West Sussex County
 Council (<a href="http://www.westsussex.gov.uk">http://www.westsussex.gov.uk</a>
), will produce a series of modules that are easy to distribute and install. It will also formulate
 and share best practice guidelines for accessible design, and identify
 accessibility issues where more work is needed.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is important for designers of online services to think through what
 they're trying to achieve. LAWS will provide an information
 architecture that should encourage this," said project director Roland
 Mezulis of West Sussex. "Designers should be thinking about the
 easiest way to navigate through a site to a given point, not just about
 what colour combinations to have," he said. According to Mezulis,
 specific challenges include designing accessible transactional services
 such as online payments, and how to present content stored on legacy
 systems in accessible formats.
</p>
<p> 
 The new national LAWS project builds on earlier work by the
 APLAWS project (<a href="http://www.aplaws.org.uk">http://www.aplaws.org.uk</a>
 - see also E-Access Bulletin issue 29, May 2002).
</p>
<h3 id="i42-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Wish-List For Digital Television.</h3>
<p> 
 The ability to change the text size and colour balance of the
 electronic
 programme guides would be the most useful accessibility function to
 build in to interactive digital television services, according to a
 survey
 of more than 200 vision impaired people published by the RNIB last
 month.
</p>
<p> 
 Speech output for all functions was also favoured by 165 of the 204
 respondents, while a similar number called for audio described
 programming and fewer functions.
</p>
<p> 
 One survey respondent said: "I'd like a screen-reading function (like
 JAWS for a PC) on all text-based screens so that I can use my TV
 similarly to the way in which I use my PC." Another said: "If this one
 device could have a selection of interfaces (visual or otherwise),
 text,
 sign language, audio (speech) output and variable settings then all
 users could customise it to their personal needs."
</p>
<p> 
 A third respondent looked forward to an age of technology
 convergence: "In the long run I'd like one machine that serves as an
 entertainment centre, PC and communications device, so that
 everything I currently do with a PC, telephone, TV, stereo, video,
 DVD player and so on could be housed in one bit of kit with one
 screen, one set of speakers and one keyboard, mouse or remote control.
 I've got too much to plug in right now!"
</p>
<p> 
 The survey was stage four of a five stage research programme
 conducted by Sylvie Perera of the RNIB Scientific Research Unit. The
 first three parts provide an overview of the issues; an assessment of
 the
 use of smart cards as a way for people to save personal viewing
 settings; and a usability assessment by partially sighted people. The
 final stage attempted to create a design specification for some of the
 requested functions.

<h3 id="i42-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Rnib Relaunches Web Site.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB is to relaunch its main web site (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk">http://www.rnib.org.uk</a>
) next week, to make it more user-friendly for visitors with impaired
 vision.
</p>
<p> 
 According to website manager Margaret O'Donnell the previous site,
 which went live in 1995, had grown too large and as a result contained
 out-of-date information and had layout inconsistencies between
 sections. "Before, we had a big maintenance problem with 20,000
 HTML files on the site and a team of only three people." To combat
 this, a new accessible content management system has been installed,
 which has also been applied to the RNIB's intranet.
</p>
<p> 
 The new site, which has been two years in the making, will also be
 easier to navigate with assistive technologies. "Better-structured
 documents will make it easier to read or scan with screen readers,"
 O'Donnell said. Staff have also been trained in how to write for text-
 to-speech software, and other web accessibility issues including plain
 style and the avoidance of jargon.
</p>
<p> 
 The site will include information on accessing technology, with fact-
 sheets and resources.
</p>
<h3 id="i42-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Further Education Guidance Published.</h3>
<p> 
 Guidance for further education providers on how to overcome access
 difficulties faced by students, including access to technology, has
 been
 published by further education technology information service Ferl.
</p>
<p> 
 A series of 13 papers covers topics ranging from the basic legal
 requirements of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001
 to practical guidance on how to make the most of a disabled person's
 education (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ferl1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ferl1</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Other papers include ways to improve online assessment; assistive
 technologies; learning platforms and the learning experience.

<p>  Leesa Lavigne, a web designer and computer operator for the State of Maine in Canada, wrote in with some concerns about
 the National Library for the Blind's new 'A-Sites' accessible web sites
 portal (see E-Access Bulletin, May 2003, story 03).
</p>
<p> 
 "I was really excited when I saw the listing of accessible sites and
 couldn't wait to pass it on to other State of Maine workers as an
 example. But the first site I visited, 'Cats Online' in the 'Animals
 and
 wildlife' category (<a href="http://www.cats.org.uk">http://www.cats.org.uk</a>
), was lacking the alt text for
 the navigation buttons and for most of the images on the pages.

 "Close but not quite . . . keep trying. We really need a resource like
 that but someone has to maintain quality control. I will check out some

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION THREE: ANALYSIS- ACCESS CHECKERS.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: THE HUMAN FACTORby Derek Parkinson  <a href="mailto:derek@headstar.com">derek@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 A growing number of web sites proudly demonstrate their commitment
 to accessibility by displaying logos for automated accessibility
 checkers such as Bobby (<a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com">http://bobby.watchfire.com</a>
), WAVE (<a href="http://wave.webaim.org">http://wave.webaim.org</a>
) or A-Prompt (<a href="http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca">http://aprompt.snow.utoronto.ca</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Jostling together at the foot of home pages, these banners can give the
 impression that sites are as accessible as any reasonable person could
 expect. But an automated checker is no panacea. Broadly speaking,
 they tell a site designer where changes may be needed, and more
 advanced products will offer some options for solving the problems,
 but they don't assess the overall coherence of a site, and some aspect
 of accessibility simply cannot be mechanically assessed.
</p>
<p> 
 This is partly because most checkers base their site analysis on
 recognised standards such as the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>
), and the standards themselves don't offer a simple recipe for accessibility. "It's important to remember that WAI
 is
 only a set of guidelines, not rules, and not a checklist," says Julie
 Howell of the RNIB. "For example the guidelines will recommend that
 images on a site are linked to text descriptions, but that doesn't
 guarantee that the descriptions will be clear or useful," she says. "I
 think most people would agree that checkers are never good enough on
 their own."
</p>
<p> 
 To be effective, checkers must form part of a wider process that
 includes an informed person acting on their recommendations.
 "Checking for accessibility is a bit like spell-checking a document.
 The
 spell-checker can make best guesses of misspelled words based on
 patterns that it knows. However, it takes a human to make the final
 decision," says Wendy Chisholm, head of the evaluation tools working
 group at WAI.
</p>
<p> 
 Does this mean that a capable web designer using a checker will
 always produce a more accessible site? Well not necessarily, according
 to recent research from Stanford University in the US
 (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/stanf1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/stanf1</a>
). In one of the first studies of its
 kind, the team gave experienced web designers two groups of sites to
 work on, making changes to the first using only their own knowledge;
 and to the second using only prompts from three widely used checkers,
 Bobby, LIFT (<a href="http://www.usablenet.com">http://www.usablenet.com</a>
), and Validator (<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The modified sites were tested by vision impaired volunteers and the
 results compared. Perhaps surprisingly, this particular study found
 that
 in many cases, sites modified using a checker were no more accessible
 than unmodified sites or sites modified using only the designer's
 knowledge. "Results suggest that the three automated evaluation tools
 were not very effective in helping designers to improve web site
 usability and accessibility," the study concludes.
</p>
<p> 
 There are , however, several ways to improve on this disappointing
 performance according to the experts. "More research needs to be done
 to make the guidelines and the tools themselves more usable," the
 Stanford report says. "Guidelines are often too long or too vague for
 designers without a human-factors background to understand. Thus,
 designers experienced difficulties interpreting them, which in turn
 interfered with their ability to implement appropriate changes".
 According to Wendy Chisholm several international groupings are now
 working to harmonise test criteria. "In the next year, expect more
 agreement on the tests that are needed to evaluate content and more
 agreement between tools," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 There are further advantages to be gained by integrating accessibility
 testing more tightly into the content production process. "I wasn't
 surprised by the results of this study. There's a big gap between
 identifying what's wrong and understanding what changes need to be
 made," says Helen Petrie, Professor of Human Computer Interaction at
 City University in London. "If a designer coding web pages is the only
 person responsible for making changes, there are difficulties. This is
 a
 job more suitable for the author. The author has a better understanding
 of what the content should mean," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 Perhaps the greatest danger ahead is the lazy assumption that
 automated tools can somehow replace human involvement in
 improving accessibility. "By all means use these tools, but remember
 they are only one part of the toolkit," says Julie Howell. "Use people
 with disabilities in the testing cycle, and if you can, consult with
 people before you start." Where accessibility is concerned, the human
 factor is key.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>SECTION FOUR: OPINION- E-DEMOCRACY.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: KARL MARX AND THE TECHNOLOGY GAPby Kevin Carey  <a href="mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 The Office of the e-Envoy (OeE) has begun to show an admirable
 interest in the subject of e-democracy, defined as the use of
 information and communications technologies to enhance citizen
 participation, as opposed to e-government which is supposed to
 enhance the government's services to citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 Now although Marxism is an almost completely discredited political
 theory, some of its social theories still hold good and are based on
 historical analysis rather than malicious cynicism. Two such
 observations are: that in periods of change, the rich benefit more than
 the poor so that the gap between the two groups widens; and that the
 faster the change, the wider the gap.
</p>
<p> 
 These truisms apply to economic and technological development. In
 economics, for example, they are demonstrated in the fact that
 although the government has had a serious and sustained anti-poverty
 strategy since 1997, the gap between the rich and the poor in the late
 1990s actually widened because of the rate of economic growth.
</p>
<p> 
 There is no reason to believe that technological development will be
 any different, and if the government wants to use technology as the
 basis for citizen participation in democracy then we are on very shaky
 ground.
</p>
<p> 
 For a start, as the government uses on-line consultation instead of the
 tedious face-to-face method, it shortens consultative periods. This, in
 turn, cuts out trusted intermediaries for consumers, such as the RNIB
 or Action for Blind People. Instead of consultative documents being
 passed from officers to elected trustees and from them to their
 constituencies, with a reverse flow back up to officials, officers of
 interest groups might have to take snap decisions on behalf of citizens
 in order for an organisation's views to be included. The whole system
 of civil society we built up in the 20th century is in danger of
 crumbling in less than a decade.
</p>
<p> 
 Second, the use of the home computer for local referenda and other
 kinds of votes will bias the results in favour of computer owners - in
 other words, the rich and powerful. If a council wants to know people's
 thoughts about a planning proposal to build a chemical factory, for
 example, who is going to be most effective in the lobbying and where
 do you suppose the factory will be built?
</p>
<p> 
 Third, most people make their views known through the ballot box.
 They may not vote in such great numbers as we would all like, but
 collectively we lay down a democratic mandate for a council or the
 government. How will the poor and the disabled figure when mass
 straw polling can be conducted through the broadband PC, digital
 television and the text message?
</p>
<p> 
 As if these concerns were not enough, there is still considerable
 reluctance on the part of the government to guarantee access by blind
 and vision impaired people to digital broadcasting through the
 Communications Bill currently working its way through the House of
 Lords (see <a href="http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk">http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk</a>
). It is only after ferocious campaigning by the RNIB that the matter has even
 grudgingly been put on the agenda.
</p>
<p> 
 At the very least we should insist that all democratic processes should
 use every available channel, including land line phones. We should
 also remember that although home computer-based technology is
 important, access to broadcasting has never been more crucial for all
 of
 us in an age of technology convergence and e-democracy.
