<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Eu Expansion Threatens Anti-Discriminationlaw.
</h3>
<p> 
 The expanded European Union negotiated by its members in December
 - with ten new member states joining by 2004 and three others in due
 course - could delay progress on toughening up anti-discrimination
 laws by up to five years, according to the European Disability Forum
 (EDF - <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org">http://www.edf-feph.org</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 It is feared that new entrant countries, where progress on anti-
 discrimination is less well-advanced, could block moves by the forum
 to include access to goods and services in EU anti-discrimination
 legislation. At present EU laws only prevent discrimination in
 education and the workplace (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/EU4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/EU4</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 "We're working with other groups to try to and change the voting
 mechanism to qualified majority voting instead of unanimous support,
 but this is going to be extremely difficult," an EDF spokesperson told
 E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 On the positive side, the fact that this year is the European Year of
 People with Disabilities (<a href="http://www.eypd2003.org">http://www.eypd2003.org</a>
) could provide an opportunity for campaigners to win support for the desired changes.
</p>
<p> 
 The centrepiece of the European year, which launches officially at the
 end of January in Athens, will be a session of the European Parliament
 drawing together disability campaign groups and aid organisations
 across Europe. Representatives will discuss proposals such as a UN
 Convention for Persons with Disabilities. A date for the Parliament has
 yet to be approved, but it is likely to take place in November.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Mass Communications Protest Set Forfebruary.
</h3>
<p> 
 A mass lobby being organised by the RNIB for 4 February will aim to
 force the UK government to make amendments to its Communications
 Bill to ensure digital TV, radio and mobile phones are accessible to
 everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 The institute is expecting up to 500 people to convene at the House of
 Commons to express dissatisfaction at the bill, currently proceeding
 through Parliament, which will set the standards for the digitisation
 of
 television and radio. Caroline Ellis, Parliamentary manager at the
 RNIB, said: "The objectives are not woolly-minded - there are precise
 amendments we want made to the bill."
</p>
<p> 
 Among the protestors' demands is the raising of the prescribed quota
 of audio description for TV programmes from ten to 50 per cent over
 ten years; and ensuring accessibility of digital products and services
 such as remote controls and electronic programme guides. Lobbyists
 want to see all such amendments established as guidelines for the new
 communications 'super-regulator' OFCOM
 (<a href="http://www.ofcom.gov.uk">http://www.ofcom.gov.uk</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 Direct lobbying for change by disability groups has seen success in the
 past, with groups representing deaf people for example winning
 increased TV subtitle quotas.
</p>
<p> 
 The February rally, which is supported by seven other organisations
 including the British Computer Association of the Blind and the Guide
 Dogs for the Blind Association, begins at 2pm at Westminster Hall in
 the House of Commons. A coach will take people from RNIB Judd
 Street in Kings Cross to Westminster. For more information email

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Effectiveness Doubts Over E-Governmentchampion.
</h3>
<p> 
 The forthcoming appointment of a US e-government policy champion
 is unlikely to speed up the process of opening online public services
 to
 citizens with disabilities, a former Washington policy chief told E-
 Access Bulletin this week.
</p>
<p> 
 The country's new E-Government Act, signed into law by President
 Bush in December, provides for the appointment of an E-Government
 Administrator to help shape and implement national policy, including
 compliance with accessibility standards for government contracts set
 out in section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
 (<a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 However consultant Timothy Sprehe, a former senior policymaker at
 the US Office of Management and Budget, said the new champion
 would not make much difference to implementation of accessibility
 law as responsibility for the field would be shared with existing
 agencies such as the Center for Information Technology
 Accommodation. In the absence of a stronger mandate for the new
 champion these agencies would continue to take the lead, Sprehe said.
</p>
<p> 
 "The administrator is more likely to perform oversight of the center's
 activities, arguing that under his or her oversight the center is doing
 the
 job well enough," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Furthermore, a recent report in US publication Government Computer
 News suggests that current initiatives are making slow progress
 implementing section 508. Many government departments are reported
 to only be adapting their services a year beyond the deadline for
 compliance (<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/fcn">http://fastlink.headstar.com/fcn</a>
).</p>
<p>

 service at <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">http://thomas.loc.gov</a>

<h3 id="i37-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: First Graduates From Access Training Course.</h3>
<p> 
 Two UK-based computer access technology trainers this month
 became the first to win recognition of their skills from the British
 Computer Association of the Blind's Trainer Certification Scheme
 (BCTS).
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB-backed BCTS (<a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs">http://www.bcab.org.uk/btcs</a>
) is intended to ensure access training in the UK is of a consistently high standard
 (see
 'The battle for recognition', section four, E-Access Bulletin December
 2002). More than 50 trainers are currently enrolled on the
 certification
 scheme, 30 of whom are expected to qualify by the summer of 2003.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the scheme has drawn criticism from access consultant Brian
 Hartgen (<a href="http://hartgen.org.uk">http://hartgen.org.uk</a>
), who complained in a letter posted onto the 'access-uk' email list
 (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/access-uk/message/30740">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/access-uk/message/30740</a>
) that there is no compulsory 'blind-awareness' element to the course,
 ensuring trainers understand the basics of communicating clearly with
 blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 Manager of the course Steve Plumpton defended it saying a voluntary
 awareness class was available and that awareness would be part of the
 final assessment. He said attempts had been made to improve the
 awareness aspect of the course, but admitted he was unsure whether
 they had been adequately implemented.
</p>
<p> 
 Hartgen also complained the course costs too much at 1,500 pounds.
 However, Plumpton said an RNIB subsidy currently cuts the cost to the
 customer from over 4,000 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 The first two to qualify were Charles Clark, a resource worker for the
 Grampian Society for the Blind
 (<a href="http://www.grampianblind.demon.co.uk">http://www.grampianblind.demon.co.uk</a>
), and Barry Coates, an RNIB access technology trainer. Both received their certificate for their
 ability to train people in the use of the JAWS screen reader.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>13: SECTION THREE: FOCUS- MULTIPLE DISABILITY.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>A COMPLEX WEB OF SUPPORTby Phil Cain  <a href="mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Visually impaired people often have additional special needs: among
 the visually impaired adults under 60 surveyed by the RNIB in 1991,
 some 46 per cent said they had another "limiting permanent illness or
 disability". In the population at large the figure is 16 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 There is a strong need, therefore, for computer systems serving those
 with physical, mental or sensory impairments to also cater for those
 with low or no vision.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem of supporting multiple needs is complex, since the further
 needs of the visually impaired are, naturally, as diverse as those of
 the
 wider population. But among the many different combinations of needs
 there is one constant: in each individual case it is extremely hard to
 say
 with assurance which support organisation will be catering for a
 persons needs. "It is a matter of where you live," says Gill Levy,
 development officer at the RNIB's multiple disabilities service. "There
 is a game of pass the parcel between agencies when people have
 multiple disabilities."
</p>
<p> 
 The diversity of solutions matches the large number of causes for
 multiple disabilities which include visual impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 The main culprit is the same as that for visual impairment itself, old
 age. One of the most common problems found alongside visual
 impairment among the elderly is hearing loss, which presents particular
 difficulties in terms of access to computers if it affects someone who
 would otherwise use a screen reader. Such problems can be overcome
 by the use of refreshable Braille displays, but non-Braille users who
 use sign language must wait for machines which could translate digital
 text into manual signs to progress beyond the research phase. For more
 on deafblindness see E-Access Bulletin issue 13, January 2001, section
 two.
</p>
<p> 
 Other problems which commonly afflict younger visually impaired
 people include cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, multiple sclerosis,
 head injuries, diabetes, strokes, sickle cell disease or autism. Each
 of
 these can give rise to disabilities which may have common elements
 but which differ enormously in their degree, meaning that each
 person's needs has to be dealt with individually.
</p>
<p> 
 The computing and disability charity AbilityNet has compiled various
 case studies of multiple disability. Among them is Steve, a cerebral
 palsy sufferer with no hand use who communicates using a head
 pointer and who recently began to lose sight because of retinal
 bleeding. To give him access to a computer he was equipped with an
 enlarged and visually enhanced keyboard called BigKeys
 (<a href="http://www.bigkeys.co.uk">http://www.bigkeys.co.uk</a>
) and a customised version of the JAWS screen reader. JAWS needs 'macros' - customised functions - to be
 written to allow it to work with 'sticky keys', a facility which allows
 users to perform functions with a sequence of key strokes which
 normally require several keys to be pressed at once.
</p>
<p> 
 In other cases users may need different adaptations such as the use of
 one-handed or chording keyboards; 'IntelliKeys' keyboards on which
 big symbols can be overlaid (see <a href="http://www.intellitools.com">http://www.intellitools.com</a>
); or a single switch which will allow someone profoundly disabled to select a
 letter from an alphabet read out in sequence.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Nuala Davis, manager of AbilityNet's London branch,
 there are four key rules to follow when assessing people's needs. These
 are to keep the number of access packages to a minimum; to gauge the
 level of support available to the person; to keep an open mind; and to
 select the best solution for the present, no matter what the future may
 have in store for the client.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, technology can and should bring enormous benefits to
 those with multiple disabilities. "Email to those who are housebound is
 a tremendous motivation," says the RNIB's Gill Levy. She adds that
 she has often been amazed at the children who can these days recite the
 alphabet. "I suspect that with new technologies we will see a whole
 new range of people who are literate."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>14: SECTION FOUR: TECHNOLOGY- 'THIN CLIENTS'.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>RETURN TO THE BAD OLD DAYSby Dan Jellinek  <a href="mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 "In terms of computer accessibility it's like going back ten to 15
 years.
 Be afraid." Such was the stark message delivered by Andy White,
 RNIB technology officer, to delegates at the institute's recent
 'Techshare' conference (<a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare">http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The reason for White's gloom is the rise of 'thin client' computing,
 the
 system whereby large organisations with computer networks hold
 almost all information and software applications on a central server or
 servers. The 'thin client' machines on users' desktops are little more
 than keyboards and screens, with almost no locally held data, software
 or processing power. It represents a move away from the high-
 specification desktop computer and back to the 'dumb terminal' days
 of mainframe computing. Even office software applications such as
 word processors are run on the server, with the output being sent to
 the
 terminal. The result looks the same to the user, but all the actual
 computing is taking place on the remote server.
</p>
<p> 
 There are many advantages of this kind of computing: it is easier to
 update software since you only need to do so once at the centre;
 security against hackers and viruses is far tighter; general
 maintenance
 is easier; and above all, it is cheaper.
</p>
<p> 
 Those that have already adopted the technology in the UK include the
 national health service hotline NHS Direct; Barclays Bank; and the
 Admiral Insurance Group. Indeed its appeal is so strong that even the
 RNIB has said it would implement thin client technology if it were not
 for accessibility problems.
</p>
<p> 
 These problems are not trivial. The great majority of access technology
 software relies on a fully functioning PC with its own hard drive,
 central processing unit, application software and operating system and
 so will simply not function on a 'thin client' terminal.
</p>
<p> 
 "Screen magnifiers have some functionality on thin clients. They can
 grab enough information from what is coming from the server for
 simple magnification," says White. "However, the more advanced
 manipulation features of magnifiers will not function, and as for
 screen
 readers, which convert data output from programmes rather than the
 purely graphical information sent to thin clients, it is a no-go area."
</p>
<p> 
 In moving to implement thin client technology, therefore, organisations
 have completely overlooked the needs of their visually impaired
 employees, White says. In the short term, there is only one solution: a
 visually impaired employee needs to keep his or her PC working
 alongside but outside the terminal system. "Typically organisations do
 have two regimes running, and data can still be got at from outside the
 thin client system.
</p>
<p> 
 "It can be politically hard to insist on this, and employers may not
 even
 realise it is possible. But people encountering problems when asking
 for a proper PC should ask if an organisation's technical people are
 also using dumb terminals? Are they hell - they're going to be sitting
 there with their fully functioning PCs."
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, running two systems is not ideal, he says. "It is a
 work-around, and work-arounds will only work around for so long,"
 says White. "It is not good for visually impaired people to be working
 under a separate regime. Eventually their PCs will become outdated,
 for example."
</p>
<p> 
 In the longer term, therefore, there is a need to build accessibility
 in to
 thin client systems, and to this end talks are underway between makers
 of access technology and those of terminal technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Thin client systems generally use Microsoft Terminal Server software
 (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/terminal/defaul">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/technologies/terminal/defaul</a>

 t.asp) at their core, often enhanced with software such as MetaFrame
 from Citrix (<a href="http://www.citrix.com">http://www.citrix.com</a>
) which adds features such as improved load-balancing across a network.
</p>
<p> 
 Access technology specialists Dolphin Computer Access has been
 involved in discussions with both Microsoft and Citrix to see if they
 can work together to allow screenreaders to work. However as well as
 the technical problems, there are legal ones of copyright and
 commercial secrecy to overcome."
</p>
<p> 
 "You can run into a legal brick wall," says Mike Hill, software
 director
 at Dolphin. "We're waiting on Microsoft. The ball is in their court but
 they do seem keen to start testing solutions." Hill says Microsoft
 hopes
 to be able to announce further developments in time for this March's
 major international access technology conference in the US, 'CSUN'
 (<a href="http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf">http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 If Microsoft does adjust its server technology to make it more
 accessible, the Citrix add-ons should not present any further major
 problems. However the commercial relationship between Microsoft
 and Citrix is complex and ever-changing, with the two firms oscillating
 between partnership and competition. With this in mind Citrix is not
 simply waiting for Microsoft to adapt its software, but is committed to
 finding its own accessibility solutions by the second half of 2003.
</p>
<p> 
 Some progress should be made this year, with the US 'section 508' law
 requiring accessibility of all technologies purchased by federal
 government agencies likely to be a further incentive for change.
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, even if server technology is adapted to run screen
 readers centrally, technicians admit there could be problems with the
 bandwidth needed to send the sound output over the network without
 unacceptable time delays.
</p>
<p> 
 Until lasting solutions to all these problems are found, however, Andy
 White says organisations should think carefully about the implications
 of their actions. "Any employer installing thin client technology is
 currently effectively making visually impaired employees redundant."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>15: SECTION FIVE: VIEWPOINT- PRODUCT DESIGN.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>SEEKING OUT THE COMMON GROUNDby Kevin Carey  <a href="mailto:humanity@atlas.org.uk">humanity@atlas.org.uk</a> .</h3>
<p> 
 Some years ago I experienced an evening of some frustration in a
 Danish hotel because I did not realise that the telephone's numeric
 keypad worked like an old fashioned calculator rather than a modern
 phone; but a totally blind friend beat that when he checked out of a
 Miami hotel to find he had somehow triggered 24 hours of 'premium'
 (referring to price but not necessarily content) pornography on his
 television with the sound muted!
</p>
<p> 
 I think of him every time I go into another hotel room or buy a new
 piece of consumer electronics, as I did last week. My new remote
 controller for a CD player and tuner comprises one row of three and
 nine rows of four identical buttons; it sits next to one for the
 television
 and another for Sky. It differs radically from those for similar
 devices
 in my study and office. So far I have learned how to play a disc and
 find Radio 3.
</p>
<p> 
 Now of course I don't expect` the remote for a TV to be the same as
 one for a hi-fi in every respect but in an age where devices
 proliferate
 and people live ever longer would it not be a good idea to have a few
 points of commonality?
</p>
<p> 
 It would not, for example, be too much to ask for a standard numeric
 keypad similar to that for a telephone with a button left of zero for
 multi-digit keying and a button to the right for clear/ouch!/I've made
 a
 mistake. These 12 keys might be distinguished from the others by
 being round, square, oblong, or whatever shape the industry pleases.
</p>
<p> 
 We might also reasonably expect a mode or function button to be
 clearly identified and always in the same place, top right or left, or
 in
 some given relationship to the numeric keypad; and the same for the
 on/off button.
</p>
<p> 
 Next it would be nice to have the directional buttons standardised and
 capable of use in different modes so that the cursor right might double
 up in audio as 'next track', and the cursor left as 'last track'. We
 might
 also have standardised buttons for raising and lowering the volume.
</p>
<p> 
 Past that, of course, there might be many different sets of buttons for
 respective modules; but when a blind person goes into a hotel it is
 often difficult to get help to find the room, let alone be given a
 lesson
 on the remote controller (always supposing the porter is button-
 literate).
</p>
<p> 
 When we got the hi-fi home my wife discovered to her considerable
 satisfaction that the tuner display shows RDS (radio data system, the
 service which allows basic data such as a station's name to be
 displayed). At which point I asked myself a further question: why can't
 remote controllers or screen devices have primitive voice output?
</p>
<p> 
 The answer is, no reason at all other than a tiny price differential.
 The
 adaptability, after all, might be built into the remote rather than the
 main unit. Customers could then be offered a choice of remotes. What
 about one with big, vivid buttons for the blind and/or flamboyant?
 What kind of market research is it that shows that as our waists and
 bums are getting bigger by the decade our fingers are getting smaller?
 It makes you wonder what market research is for.
</p>
<p> 
 As long as all manufacturers are indifferent to the market we will all
 suffer. But it only takes one to start to turn the tide, and that one
 should
 not have to be a niche player in the visual impairment world. We don't
 drop money into tins to teach global corporations the essentials of
 product design.
