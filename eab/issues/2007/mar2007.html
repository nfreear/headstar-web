 Section One: News.
</p>
<h3 id="i87-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Assistive Products Gear Up Fast For Windows Vista.</h3>
<p> 
 Assistive technology manufacturers have responded more quickly to
 create versions of their products compatible with Microsoft's latest
 operating system Vista than with previous releases of Windows, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Some assistive technology companies were ready with public beta
 versions of their products by the time that Microsoft released Vista to
 the retail market at the end of January.
</p>
<p> 
 "The assistive technology vendors have responded very quickly in
 bringing out updates to their software," RNIB regional technical
 officer Andy White told E-Access Bulletin. "Microsoft has designed
 Vista with assistive technology software in mind." Previously
 companies had to work harder to make their software work with
 Microsoft operating systems. "Every time a new one came out, they
 had to chase their tails to keep up," White said.
</p>
<p> 
 However Eric Damery, Vice President of Product Management
 Software at Freedom Scientific, developer of popular JAWS screen
 reader, told E-Access Bulletin the development process has not been
 simple. "We have to develop, test and support customers in so many
 different configurations, the challenges tend to be very high," said
 Damery. "Vista comes along and changes the technique we have used
 for capturing the screen data," said Damery. "We are forced to
 implement and test a new solution, without breaking the old.
</p>
<p> 
 "One of the biggest challenges was that [Vista] was a moving target for
 the last three years. It was not until the last six to nine months that we
 truly understood how Microsoft would expose the information."
 Freedom Scientific made their new version of JAWS available "within
 30 days of the release of Vista," said Damery.
</p>
<p> 
 Of the popular assistive technologies for vision impaired people,
 compatible versions of the screen reader Thunder and magnifier
 Lightning from the non-profit software provider screenreader.net
 ( <a href="http://www.screenreader.net/">http://www.screenreader.net/</a>
 ) and screen reader Window-Eyes version 6.1 from US-based GW Micro
 were released to coincide with the Vista launch.
</p>
<p> 
 A Vista-compatible version of magnifier ZoomText from US company
 AiSquared was released two weeks after Vista's launch, and UK-based
 Dolphin, the assistive technology company that makes products for
 vision impaired people, has not yet launched its Vista-compatible
 version '8.1' of Supernova, a screen reader and magnifier with Braille
 support; Hal, a screen reader; and magnifiers Lunar and LunarPlus.
 Dolphin told E-Access Bulletin these will go on the market in April or
 May, with recent purchasers entitled to a free upgrade.

<h3 id="i87-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Users Flock To Free Document Conversion Service.</h3>
<p> 
 A free service allowing people to convert documents automatically to
 and from Braille and synthetic speech, accessed by email, is receiving
 some 15,000 to 20,000 new requests per month, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'RoboBraille'
 ( <a href="http://www.robobraille.org/">http://www.robobraille.org/</a>
 ) Service, funded with 560,000 pounds from the European Commission,
 is run by an international consortium led by the Danish national body
 for young people and children with impaired vision, 'Organisation
 Synscenter Refsnaes'.
</p>
<p> 
 Users, who do not need to register, send in documents as email
 attachments in Word, rich text, html or plain text formats. A specialist
 piece of software translates the documents into contracted Braille or
 mp3 files in up to five languages. Documents are returned
 electronically and must then be rendered on a Braille embosser or
 displayed on a Braille display, where a Braille format is requested.
</p>
<p> 
 "We do not register users but expect to have a core user group of more
 than 1,000 people at present," RoboBraille co-ordinator Lars Ballieu
 Christensen told E-Access Bulletin. Languages currently handled are
 Danish; English; Greek; Italian; and Portuguese. The team also plans to
 add French, Lithuanian and Norwegian.
</p>
<p> 
 "RoboBraille was the logical next step after having developed Braille
 translation software for decades that users found very difficult to use,"
 said Christensen. "With RoboBraille we are capable of automating
 processes that are otherwise rather complicated and at the same time
 maintain a system that is always up-to-date with the latest fixes."
</p>
<p> 
 The development consortium comprises The Royal National College
 for the Blind in the UK, the Associazone Nazionale Subvedenti in
 Italy, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland in Ireland, the
 National Association of Housing for the Visually Impaired in Ireland,
 Pagkypria Organozi Tyflon in Cyprus and the Centro de Inovacao para
 Deficientes (CIDEF) in Portugal.
</p>
<p> 
 The team plans to expand the service, enabling users to convert
 documents to DAISY books, Braille maths and Braille music; and
 introduce a service for banks and tax offices to send electronic
 documents to print-impaired customers.

<h3 id="i87-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Reality Gap Widens For Councils' Web Accessibility Claims.</h3>
<p> 
 The gap between claims about website accessibility made by UK local
 authorities and the true picture of accessibility has widened since last
 year, a new report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 The annual 'Better Connected' review of council sites from the local
 government Society of IT Management (Socitm) found that this year
 some 29 per cent of councils are incorrectly claiming level 'A,' 'AA'
 or 'AAA' accessibility, up from 22 per cent of councils last year.
</p>
<p> 
 Claims are usually made by a site displaying the relevant official logo
 of the international World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility
 Initiative. Socitm commissions the blindness charity RNIB to
 independently check the claims, including manual tests which are more
 rigorous than the purely automated tests on which councils and their
 technology partners often rely.
</p>
<p> 
 "That gap between claim and reality must reflect a lack of awareness,"
 said Martin Greenwood, head of Socitm's Insight Programme. "People
 are either doing it deliberately - and I'd like to think they're not - or
 they are prepared to believe what a third party supplier tells them."
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, just 71 out of a total of 468 UK councils' web sites meet
 basic level 'A' web accessibility requirements, the survey finds,
 despite the fact the UK government specifies level 'AA' as a baseline.
</p>
<p> 
 "The fact that 27 sites have not even achieved level 'A' yet have
 claimed level AAA (the highest level). . . suggests some basic
 ignorance about the task in hand," the report says. To improve the
 situation, Socitm suggests councils aim to take a long-term view of
 accessibility and to "realise the scale of task in achieving level A
 standard."
</p>
<h3 id="i87-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: 'World'S First' Free, Accessible It Training Course Goes Live.</h3>
<p> 
 What is claimed to be the world's first free, accessible, online learning
 programme teaching people the basics of computer maintenance and
 networking has been launched in Australia. The course is open for
 anyone to apply, from anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p> 
 The course runs for two days per week over a one year period.
 Students learn the fundamentals of computer operating systems and
 network infrastructure, learning how to build a computer and install
 different versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system; how to
 maintain and use networking equipment; and how to install and run
 medium to large-sized networks. The course is endorsed by networking
 infrastructure company Cisco.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Iain Murray, course co-ordinator at the Curtin University
 of Technology in Western Australia, all of the content is accessible to a
 person with an internet connection and assistive equipment such as a
 screen reader or text magnifier. "We have made notes for JAWS users
 on accessing the online material but it works just as well with other
 products including VoiceOver on Apple machines," Murray told
 E-Access Bulletin. Live lectures are delivered using the 'Skype'
 internet telephone service, which has negligible cost, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Murray, graphs, diagrams and mathematical notation
 have been made accessible. "The course is not overly mathematical but
 does include a significant amount of binary and hexadecimal
 conversions. For this we have developed a 'peg board'. It's a very
 simple device that consists of a piece of wood or plastic with three
 rows of 32 holes in it. This also allows the calculation of IP addresses
 and subnets. We ask that students attempt to get one of these made
 locally, but if that is not possible we ship one to them, at no charge,"
 said Murray.

<p>  "Will files produced with open source software be accessible to users who do not

</p>
<p> 
 David O'Brien responds: "It shouldn't matter what programme you use
 to create [a] website: as long as the HTML is written properly, JAWS
 should have no problem interpreting it. The 'universal translator' you
 mention already exists - it is valid, well-structured HTML.
</p>
<p> 
 "Web accessibility standards are set down by the Web Accessibility
 Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
</p>
<p> 
 "The general idea is that web content created by an author who
 conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) using
 an authoring tool that conforms to Authoring Tool Accessibility
 Guidelines (ATAG) which is read by a user agent that conforms to
 User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) will be as widely
 accessible as it's possible to make it. You can find out more about the
 W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative at:
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>

 but it does get a bit technical. The Web Standards Project (WASP) has
 a good summary of the case for standards at:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/wasp1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/wasp1</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 "Unfortunately, very little web content is [accessible]. There are no
 authoring tools I know of that are fully ATAG conformant. Sloppy
 web design is rife, so most web pages fail even the most rudimentary
 level of WCAG. And user agents vary widely in their support for
 UAAG. Firefox is generally held to be pretty much standards
 compliant. Internet Explorer (IE) 5 and 6 had very poor compliance.
 The general picture with user agents is very much improved.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: A Career Ladder With Broken Rungs, Part Twoby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 A courtroom can seem a daunting place, especially if you are taking on
 one of the largest law firms in the world. But this didn't stop IT
 manager Sam Latif setting out to establish how UK anti-discrimination
 law applies to electronic content.
</p>
<p> 
 Her journey to court began when she signed up for a distance learning
 course that prepared her for the 'Project Management Professional'
 qualification, awarded by the Project Management Institute (PMI), a
 not for profit organisation based in Baltimore, USA.
</p>
<p> 
 Soon after beginning the course in September 2004, Latif became
 frustrated with her struggle to obtain course material in an accessible
 electronic format from PMI, and the difficulties continued right up to
 the final examination, a year later. Although she went on to pass the
 exam, Latif decided early on to take legal action on the grounds that
 PMI infringed her rights under the Disability Discrimination Act (see
 E-Access Bulletin, February 2007).
</p>
<p> 
 Her first move was to seek advice from the Disability Rights
 Commission (DRC), a route that brought her up against new hurdles.
 "It was initially quite difficult to deal with the DRC. You get told to
 look at the DRC website for guidance, and when you ring up you get a
 different person and have to explain the situation again," she says.
 After a few weeks of persistent phoning, however, Latif was assigned a
 DRC case worker, and started to get to grips with the paperwork
 necessary for her legal case to proceed at an Employment Tribunal.
</p>
<p> 
 At this stage, although the DRC was providing assistance it hadn't
 formally backed her case, but Latif was already determined to press
 ahead. "I decided I was just going to do it by myself if I had to, but it
 was a lot more complicated than I thought" she tells E-Access Bulletin.
 "Towards the hearing the DRC decided to officially support me and
 helped me find a barrister, Paul Epstein, who has been brilliant," she
 says.

 Like most people who aren't legal professionals, the formalities of
 court business were new to Latif. In works of fiction, court cases often
 take the form of a dramatic showdown between opponents, but like
 many cases in real life, hers was dealt with over a number of hearings
 and many months. Nevertheless there was a theatrical aspect to it, she
 says. "The first hearing was interesting because it was new to me and
 helped me understand what a barrister does. In some ways it was like a
 performance," Latif says. This hearing set out some of the basic
 aspects, such as whether the DDA applied to the case.
</p>
<p> 
 It wasn't until the second hearing that Latif was able to speak on her
 own behalf. She was the first to be cross-examined that day, but didn't
 realise that this would be her only chance to speak. "I didn't really
 understand the etiquette," she says. "It was really painful to have to sit
 and listen while people said things that I disagreed with," she says.
 However, her ability to touch-type proved to be valuable, as she was
 able to take notes and talk through the important points later with her
 barrister.
</p>
<p> 
 One aspect of the case that she was unprepared for was the PMI's
 strategy of calling in accessibility experts to support its own case.
 "That was one of the worst experiences, the one that hurt me the most,"
 says Latif of the moment when Robin Christopherson, head of
 accessibility services at the widely respected charity AbilityNet, gave
 evidence in support of PMI.
</p>
<p> 
 After the hearings came to an end in June 2006, there was a long wait
 for the final verdict, which was delivered at the end of October. Instead
 of being delivered in a hushed courtroom, the news came via a simple
 email in her inbox. And the story doesn't end there: PMI has since
 decided to appeal against the verdict, a process that is likely to take
 another couple of months at least before it is resolved.
</p>
<p> 
 Looking back on her experience so far, Latif thinks she underestimated
 the impact that the case would have on her life. "There were certain
 times when it was very hard. My husband was probably the only one
 who understood this, because only he could see me studying so hard,
 and also preparing for the case," she says. But overall, Latif doesn't
 regret taking this route. "People don't normally bother. But unless they
 do, disabled people will be ignored," she says.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Focus- Digital creativity.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Image Crisisby Kevin Carey.
</h3>
<p> 
 In November 2006 I wrote a piece about Web 2.0 and the challenges it
 poses for people with impaired vision; and in other places I have
 written about the need for us to focus on content creation as well as
 consumption.
</p>
<p> 
 The important thing about Web 2.0 will not be the millions of people
 who go on and on about nothing but the few who are distinctive. To be
 distinctive, however, means knowing a great deal about sameness and
 difference; and I think this will pose a challenge both for blind and
 visually impaired people and those who work with them. I am not
 thinking here about text-only blogs but about the challenges of self-
 expression in a multi media context.
</p>
<p> 
 This is a tricky and almost completely unexplored area.
</p>
<p> 
 There is an important distinction to be made at the outset between
 buying and making. Just as we buy clothes, furniture, glassware, pets,
 cars, food and entertainment as part of our self-identity, as a way of
 saying who we are, so we can also do this on the internet in virtual
 spaces like 'Second Life'.
</p>
<p> 
 In such spaces you can construct either a true-to-life or fantasy identity
 for yourself and live a parallel, virtual life. As in real (analogue or
 'skin'), life, however, everything you do in a style obsessed world sends
 signals; so you can't afford accidents. There is a world of difference
 between wearing red trainers, blue jeans, a West African multi
 coloured top and a black velvet tail coat at a formal dinner party as a
 social and fashion statement and wearing this motley collection by
 accident thereby being mistaken for a highly self-conscious, rebellious
 poser instead of simply being careless or too lazy to bother.
</p>
<p> 
 The area of colour and style in solid items like clothes was difficult
 enough when there were rules which said when you had to wear a
 dinner jacket or could not possibly wear jeans; but all that is now
 loosening up into the melting pot of global do-it-yourself, pick-and-
 mix identity. The less rigid the rules, the more difficult it is to be your
 conscious self in a way that communicates to others what you want
 them to think and feel about you.
</p>
<p> 
 So, when you have built your composite style image (an iconic
 juxtaposition of words), how do you choose what behaviour to adopt in
 this DIY world? As a person of safe hands and sensible shoes you
 might want to match your new daring get-up with a dash of raunchy
 behaviour; but what is that really like and how will it be taken? Here
 we are in that very tricky area of credibility. Image construction is a
 usually benign form of lying; and there is nothing worse than a bad
 liar. There is a paradox about coherence and incoherence which people
 with impaired vision will find difficult: over-coherence is suspected of
 being false while messiness, paradoxically, is seen as more authentic
 but there are pitfalls in style construction.
</p>
<p> 
 If you think that this form of consumption and construction is difficult,
 wait until you get to the creation from scratch, the "I am me"
 multimedia piece involving no off-the-peg digital products. Here again,
 we don't want to be limited to endless text blogging, but how will the
 sector come to grips with image composition and movement? The
 simple and sad answer is that we don't have a clue.
</p>
<p> 
 The starting point would be to put together user requirements and then
 turn these in to specifications for content creation tools. Then we
 would have to persuade tool makers to listen and persuade curriculum
 designers to include this topic in the training of teachers and others
 who work with blind people. And if you think this is all just a little
 fantastic, you are probably right.
