<h3 id="i86-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: E-Learning Company Appeals Against Inaccessibility Ruling.</h3>
<p> 
 A landmark legal ruling on how UK anti-discrimination law applies to
 online content is in doubt after Project Management International
 (PMI), a professional body that offers membership through online
 examinations, launched an appeal to overturn a ruling that it
 discriminated against a blind IT manager in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 The appeal by PMI challenges a finding by Reading Employment
 Tribunal, in November 2006, that the organisation had failed to make
 reasonable adjustments for Sumaira "Sam" Latif to access a computer-
 based examination. The judgment is thought to be the first time a
 ruling has been made against a provider of online content under the
 UK Disability Discrimination Act.
</p>
<p> 
 Her case, which was supported by the Disability Rights Commission,
 claimed that PMI discriminated against her in three separate ways: by
 making unreasonable demands to confirm that she suffered a disability;
 by failing to provide accessible course material; and by failing to make
 reasonable adjustments for her to sit the final examination.
</p>
<p> 
 The tribunal dismissed the first two claims, but agreed that Latif
 suffered discrimination when it came to the final examination, known
 as the Project Management Professional Credential Examination. This
 consists of 200 multiple choice questions, some including complex
 graphs and charts, which candidates must complete in four hours.
 Candidates access the examination material through networked
 computer terminals at 15 test centres in the UK. Latif was awarded
 compensation of 3,000 pounds "in respect of the injury to her
 feelings".
</p>
<p> 
 In the event, Latif passed the exam, but felt that PMI failed to address
 her needs adequately. Her request to use a screen reader in the
 examination room was refused, as was her request for tactile diagrams
 of graphs and charts. Latif was given the option of either not taking the
 examination, or completing a paper-based version with the assistance
 of a human reader supplied by BMI. "I was told I could only meet the
 reader half an hour before the exam. He had no experience of reading
 for a blind person," Latif told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), the appeal is
 unlikely to be heard before April. E-Access Bulletin understands that
 PMI is likely to argue that it made reasonable adjustments for Latif,
 and also that too much of the burden of proof was placed on PMI to
 show that it hadn't acted in a discriminatory way, rather than on Latif
 to show that it had, said the DRC.

<h3 id="i86-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: State Of Texas Sued Over Inaccessible Software.</h3>
<p> 
 The US National Federation of the Blind ( NFB -
 <a href="http://www.nfb.org">http://www.nfb.org</a>
 ) and three blind employees of two Texas state government agencies
 have filed a lawsuit against their employers and the state's chief
 technology officer for their alleged continuing failure to ensure that
 information technology is accessible to blind staff . If proven, the
 allegation would mean the state would be in contravention of its own
 law.
</p>
<p> 
 The dispute centres around the agencies' human resources software
 supplied by Oracle, which the employees say does not provide equal
 access to blind people using screen access technology. The lawsuit
 follows repeated attempts by blind employees of the Health and
 Human Services Commission
 ( <a href="http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us">http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us</a>
 ) and the Texas Workforce Commission
 ( <a href="http://www.twc.tx.us">http://www.twc.tx.us</a>
 ) to bring the issue to their employers' attention each time the software's licence has come up for renewal, a
 spokesperson for the NFB told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "The three state employees brought it to their supervisors' attention
 repeatedly from the time the systems were first installed," said the
 spokesperson. "In June 2005, they were told that the system was
 accessible, even though it wasn't and were subsequently told that it
 would be made accessible by September 2006. That date came and
 went without resolving the accessibility issues."
</p>
<p> 
 One of the blind employees, Edwin Kunz, who directs a rehabilitation
 centre for the blind within the Health and Human Services
 Commission, said: "I am unable to review and enter information, such
 as my hours worked and leave taken, unless a sighted person helps me
 to do so. Even worse, I can't access critical information about the
 employees that I supervise without the assistance of a sighted person."
</p>
<p> 
 The objectives for the lawsuit are two-fold: to ensure that Texas
 complies with its own laws and in future purchases only accessible
 technology; and to force the state to replace the current inaccessible
 software programs with accessible ones.
</p>
<p> 
 "The state legislature of Texas recognised the need for equal access for
 the blind by passing a law requiring it, and it is unconscionable that a
 state agency is violating that law," said Tommy Craig, President of the
 NFB's Texas branch. "We will not rest until all of the employees of the
 state of Texas have equal access to all the information they need to
 function effectively."

<h3 id="i86-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Teaching Resource Planned For Northern Ireland.</h3>
<p> 
 A project to investigate the feasibility of creating a central resource for
 alternative formats for teaching materials and textbooks in Northern
 Ireland has begun this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The Department of Education for Northern Ireland has engaged former
 school inspector Paddy Manning to assess the lack of access to books
 and teaching materials in Braille, electronic and large print format in
 Northern Ireland's schools. He will report back on 26 March on the
 case for creating a central resource and the practical implications of
 such a move.
</p>
<p> 
 "[Government] is not doubting there's a problem. They're seeing what
 they can do about it," said David Mann, campaigns officer at RNIB
 Northern Ireland. Currently, teachers and teaching assistants have to
 photocopy, enlarge and retype pages from textbooks to turn into Braille
 or large print, to allow vision impaired schoolchildren access to
 National Curriculum teaching materials. "A schoolkid has to rely on
 poor quality photocopies. Other times they'll have to wait a month or
 two for a textbook," Barry Macaulay, Campaigns Manager at RNIB
 Northern Ireland, told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Prior to the move Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from
 each of the three main political parties of the Northern Irish
 government wrote to the minister for education asking for a solution to
 be found.
</p>
<p> 
 The scoping exercise builds on the findings of the RNIB report
 "Where's My Book?"
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headastar.com/rnib8">http://fastlink.headastar.com/rnib8</a>
 ) published last year, which looked at the availability of teaching
 materials in accessible formats. This found none of the science
 textbooks prescribed by examination boards in Wales or Northern
 Ireland for key stage 4 schoolchildren is available in any accessible
 format.
</p>
<p> 
 On 28 March there will be a government lobby in England where
 teachers, schoolchildren and parents will gather at Westminster to meet
 Members of Parliament (MPs) and raise awareness of the lack of
 alternative formats in schools as part of RNIB's Right To Read
 campaign.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, the Scottish Executive, Scotland's government, is
 considering the business case for developing a central transcription
 service for creating alternative formats for teaching materials. There
 are no plans to undertake this exercise in England.
</p>
<h3 id="i86-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Tests For Live Digital Display Reader.</h3>
<p> 
 Software is being developed to allow vision impaired people to read
 information on the digital display screens of electronic household
 products and at supermarket checkouts, a Spanish company has
 announced.
</p>
<p> 
 The DISPLAYER will allow vision impaired users to read everyday
 information displays including dynamic displays, such as those on
 microwaves, digital clocks, boilers and those found at public transport
 stations and supermarket checkouts.
</p>
<p> 
 The device would ultimately take the form of software or an
 application that could be installed on a smartphone or personal digital
 assistant (PDA) with a built-in camera. To read something on a
 display, users would hold the mobile device near it, capture an image
 of it and the system would interpret and read the content aloud using
 speech output technology.
</p>
<p> 
 "To help them capture the image of the display," said Igone Id&#237;goras
 Leibar, Principal Researcher at Robotiker-Tecnalia
 ( <a href="http://www.robotiker.com/">http://www.robotiker.com/</a>
 ), the Spanish company behind the technology. "It orientates the user
 with [speech output], for example, it would say 'on the image there is
 no display' or 'move the camera to the right so that the display
 appears,'" she told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 User testing with vision impaired people is due to start shortly. "Our
 idea is that the end users participate [in the development], not only at
 the end of the project but from the initial stages that we are now at,"
 Leibar said. Tests have begun to ensure the device is usable in various
 lighting conditions, carried out by over 80 people using 500 appliances
 in their homes using different types of digital camera.
</p>
<p> 
 Last October the DISPLAYER project won the top award of 240,000
 Euros in a competition run by Spain's national blindness organisation
 ONCE to recognise technology research projects helping vision-
 impaired people. ONCE has undertaken to test and evaluate the final
 prototype, due to be ready in 2008.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: A Career Ladder With Broken Rungsby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 Sam Latif is serious about getting on in her career as an IT manager
 with Procter and Gamble, the world's largest consumer goods
 company. So when the company agreed to fund her and six other
 colleagues to study for a project management qualification that is
 recognised across the world, Sam felt she had taken a major step
 forward in her career.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Project Management Professional' qualification is awarded by the
 Project Management Institute (PMI), a non-profit organisation based in
 Baltimore, USA. With around 200,000 members worldwide, PMI
 requires candidates to complete a course of distance learning that
 typically lasts around nine months. "The PMI qualification is one of
 the best. It's the "gold standard" for the industry," Latif says.
</p>
<p> 
 The final examination fort he qualification involves answering 200
 multiple choice questions, some of which include complex graphs and
 charts, delivered to candidates through computer terminals at one of 15
 test centres in the UK. Candidates are given four hours to complete the
 exam, and must score at least 137 to pass.
</p>
<p> 
 Latif is blind, but although much of the learning and examination
 materials are delivered from a distance, at this stage she saw no reason
 why she should have a problem with it, being both IT-literate and
 equipped with the latest JAWS 6.0 screen reader software. She began
 the course in September 2004 and formed a study circle with her
 colleagues, so they could swap ideas and insights about the course
 work.
</p>
<p> 
 The first hint of the problems ahead came when she tried to find an
 accessible version of the Project Management Book of Knowledge
 (PMBOK). PMBOK puts in one place a comprehensive guide to good
 practice drawn from the knowledge and experience of project
 management practitioners, and it was strongly recommended that
 students read it.
</p>
<p> 
 Having only started to learn Braille at the age of 16 Latif is not a
 proficient Braille reader, and so depended on finding the book in an
 accessible electronic format. It seemed reasonable to expect that a
 global organisation focused on distance learning would be able to
 address her needs. What actually followed was eight weeks of phone
 calls and email requests to PMI offices in the US and Europe, and the
 sense that she was getting nowhere, while the clock ticked on towards
 the final exam date. "It was very frustrating. I felt I was just being
 passed from person to person around the organisation," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, an electronic copy of PMBOK arrived in her inbox, but it was
 encoded in Adobe's Portable Document Format and was inaccessible
 to her screen reader. Then she was sent a version in Microsoft Word
 which she could read, but not navigate around easily, making it
 difficult to jump between different sections of the book. She turned to
 the RNIB for help, and the organisation transcribed parts of PMBOK
 into the DAISY standard electronic book format for her. Latif had
 made progress, but she was still unable to read the complex charts and
 graphs.
</p>
<p> 
 "I put in a lot more time and effort than maybe I needed to," she says.
 To help make up for lost time Latif paid a student to read the course
 materials to her for three hours every Tuesday and Thursday between
 February and August, in preparation for her final deadline to take the
 exam, September 2005.
</p>
<p> 
 Having experienced these difficulties in finding accessible course
 materials, she was beginning to worry about what might await her in
 the exam room. To make special arrangements for her, PMI requested
 proof of Latif's vision impairment, but refused to accept the
 registration card issued by her local authority.

<p> 
 "The final straw was when I sent PMI an email telling them what I
 needed in order to do the exam," Latif says. "They replied that either I
 could sit a version on paper with a human reader for assistance, or not
 at all," she says. Worse, PMI insisted that it would supply the reader,
 and Latif would meet the person for the first time just half an hour
 before the exam started.
</p>
<p> 
 She passed the exam and gained her 'Project Management
 Professional' qualification, but after thinking further about her
 experiences and how she had been treated, she decided to take the
 matter further with legal action against PMI under the UK's Disability
 Discrimination Act.
</p>
<p> 
 It is a battle which continues today: although Latif won a partial
 victory with an initial ruling in an employment tribunal which found
 she had suffered discrimination in relation to the final examination, the
 organisation is appealing the decision (see Story 01, News section, this
 issue). Whatever happens one senses that Latif, fuelled by a sense of
 indignation at finding herself apparently ignored, will not give up the
 struggle lightly.
</p>
<p> 
 "One of the reasons this has got to where it has is that no-one at PMI
 took responsibility," she says. "I was just passed around, and it was so
 frustrating".

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Taking Testing Off The Back Burnerby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 Before a new website, software or digital device is released on the
 market, it is tested for accessibility and usability to ensure it can be
 used by the maximum amount of customers - in theory.
</p>
<p> 
 In practice, this may not always be the case and even if testing does
 take place, standards are inconsistent. Indeed, there are no international
 standards across Europe relating to this important component of the
 development process. And there is no legal requirement to carry out
 testing, let alone laws relating to how organisations should carry it out.
 So whether or not a new service or product is tested and evaluated is
 usually down to the company that creates or supplies it.
</p>
<p> 
 A recently published report
 (<a href="http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/wg3_questionnaire_report.htm">http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/wg3_questionnaire_report.htm</a>
) however, has bolstered the case for further work in this vital area.
 Undertaken by the EU-funded technology access research organisation
 COST 219-ter
 ( <a href="http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/">http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/</a>
 ), the report surveyed disability organisations across Europe.
</p>
<p> 
 It concludes little attention has been paid to the actual methods used
 for testing electronic products and services with diverse user groups
 including disabled users. And while there are guidelines to follow such
 as those from the international Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/</a>
 ), there is an unsystematic approach to conducting user testing across
 Europe, the report found.
</p>
<p> 
 The number of methods for testing used in respondents' organisations
 varied from three to 14 and include, among others: task analysis,
 "cognitive walkthroughs," laboratory observations, expert groups,
 expert panels, focus groups, questionnaires, interviews and diary-
 keeping.
</p>
<p> 
 Some respondents said they test on an ad-hoc basis while others apply
 strict methodical testing techniques for everything they or other
 companies produce. One respondent said: "We mostly perform
 evaluations, not actual testing, when we think it's appropriate. We try
 to collect as much information as we can and discuss the use and
 usability with experts in the specific fields of interest. The result is a
 'point-of-view' that we publish on our website and in other
 publications on paper."
</p>
<p> 
 At the other end of the spectrum, there are still many companies
 undertaking minimal or no user testing at all on their products and
 services at all. According to Dr John Gill, RNIB's Chief Scientist, the
 speed of development of an electronic service or product nowadays is
 such that testing and evaluation by people with a disability gets
 knocked off the 'to-do' list in the rush for the market release.
 "Particularly in telecommunications, the development time is short, the
 marketing time is short, and they want to get there before the
 competition," Gill says.
</p>
<p> 
 But time need not be a barrier. Companies such as The Usability
 Exchange, for example, offer short testing turnaround times. "It's no
 excuse to say there's no time," says director Stefan Hasselwimmer.
 "[Testing] should happen at the beginning and there should be lots of
 little tests all the way through the process. A lot of people do it at the
 end then don't want to hear if there's anything wrong."
</p>
<p> 
 The report also found it is vital to harmonise the different national
 testing methodologies that exist in Europe. The answer to this may be
 to create standards, but this in itself can bring problems according to
 some. "There is a danger that you end up creating another set of
 lengthy documents akin to WAI standards that people have difficulty
 using and that distract people from the important job of simply talking
 to disabled users more," says Hasselwimmer.
</p>
<p> 
 "What is much more important than printed standards is actual
 standardised processes and systems," he says. "There is scope for
 'rolling standards' that are evidence based, geared towards specific
 sectors and updated regularly. These would be based on conducting
 extensive disabled user testing in particular areas."
</p>
<p> 
 "With things to do with measuring and testing, one tends to focus on
 what's easy to measure, like in school exams," the RNIB's John Gill
 told E-Access Bulletin. "This does not necessarily give you the whole
 picture."
