<h3 id="i93-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: 'Pay By Touch' Bank Cards Launched In London.</h3>
<p> 
 Wireless-enabled bank cards tested in London this month will pave the
 way for a new system of cashless payments, enabling small purchases
 to be made in pharmacies, newsagents, and snack bars without
 providing a PIN number or a signature.
</p>
<p> 
 The system is to be tested by around 1,000 retailers located in and
 around rail and bus stations across the capital. For items costing up to
 10 pounds, users will pay by simply touching a reader device located at
 the cash till with new credit and debit cards issued by Barclaycard,
 Visa, or Mastercard. The cards use a short-range wireless technology
 known as Near Field Communication to exchange data with the reader
 device, which emits an audible "beep" when the transaction is
 completed.
</p>
<p> 
 By the end of 2007 it is hoped that 2,000 outlets will be involved in the
 scheme, Barclaycard told E-Access Bulletin. "At this stage it's a
 'chicken and egg' situation. We need interest from consumers before
 retailers will take an interest. That's the reason we're concentrating on
 London to start with. In the long term - and it's difficult to say how
 long this will take - we expect most retailers will move over to the new
 system," said the spokesperson.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, this way of making purchases will also be available from
 vending machines located in places such as pubs or in the street, and
 also from devices such as parking meters, said Barclaycard. "The big
 retailers such as high street supermarkets will almost certainly take a
 longer time, because their existing till systems are a significant
 investment which has to be recouped before they think about new
 technology," said Barclaycard.
</p>
<p> 
 Fear of fraud shouldn't deter people from using the new cards, said
 Barclaycard. "Most card fraud is organised and involves larger sums.
 But if a bank notices a pattern of unusual transactions it can request a
 PIN number or signature before a transaction is processed," said
 Barclaycard. The trial in London is part of much wider plans for the
 technology, Visa told
 E-Access Bulletin. "This is also being tested by Visa in France,
 Turkey, and Switzerland," said a spokesperson.

<h3 id="i93-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Rnib Disability Benefit Campaign Seeks Voices.</h3>
<p> 
 Severely vision impaired people in England, Scotland and Wales are
 being asked to keep audio diaries of the daily barriers they encounter
 due to mobility impairment, as part of an RNIB campaign for blind
 people to be able to claim the same level of state disability benefit as
 wheelchair users.
</p>
<p> 
 The move is the latest phase of the 'Taken for a ride' campaign
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnibcam">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnibcam</a>
 ), to ensure that the mobility needs of severely vision impaired people are
 recognised by the Government.
</p>
<p> 
 Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is a means-tested tax free benefit
 comprised of two parts: a care component - paid at three rates; and a
 mobility component, paid at two. Currently, severely vision impaired
 residents of England, Scotland and Wales are not entitled to the higher
 level mobility component of DLA.
</p>
<p> 
 "We wanted people with severe sight loss to be able to explain to their
 MP the real day to day difference that being able to claim the higher
 rate mobility component would make to the quality of their lives. An
 audio diary seemed to fit the bill," said RNIB Campaigns Officer
 Helen Dearman.
</p>
<p> 
 Participants are asked to record examples of what they could do, were
 they eligible for the higher rate of DLA mobility allowance. They are
 also asked to document incidents where, for example, they have been
 unable to attend hospital appointments or afford the costs incurred by
 shopping independently, visiting friends or joining classes.
</p>
<p> 
 In December, audio diaries, recorded onto standard audio tapes, will be
 presented to each campaign supporter's local MP along with a text
 transcription. A compilation of excerpts from all diaries will be
 presented to a parliamentary reception and the RNIB's Campaigns
 Department will send each campaign supporter's full audio diary to
 their local MP, encouraging them to continue to support the campaign
 and take the issue forward in the new session of Parliament.
</p>
<p> 
 The Campaign has previously seen supporters writing to their MPs
 asking them to sign a supporting Early Day Motion
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnibcamedm">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnibcamedm</a>
 ); which 248 MPs have now signed; and the largest ever lobby of
 Parliament by blind and partially sighted people in December 2005.
 Supporters are asked to make their last diary entry by 7 October.

<h3 id="i93-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: 'Ovi' Portal From Nokia To Launch In 2007.</h3>
<p> 
 Before the end of 2007 Nokia customers will be able to subscribe to
 Ovi, a portal that brings together online services such as navigation,
 music, games, and online communities. The portal enables
 personalised online services to be accessed via both mobile phones and
 personal computers for the first time.
</p>
<p> 
 Ovi includes a navigation system that contains data on 30 countries.
 When connected to a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite
 receiver a mobile phone can provide the user with audio street by street
 directions to a destination, says the company. Other services include
 the Nokia Music Store, which enables users to browse, buy, download
 and stream music tracks; and 'N-Gage' a store of online games for
 single and multiple users.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Nokia, further services and applications will be added to
 Ovi through 2008
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ovi">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ovi</a>
 ), with English language versions launched first, and other languages,
 which have yet to be announced, following. Overall, the aim is to
 provide access to richer, more engaging content while on the move
 from a range of devices and so the services are designed to be accessed
 via a PC as well as internet-enabled mobile phones.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, the Ovi services are compatible with N95 handset, and the
 soon to be launched N81. The latter has been designed specifically
 with Ovi services in mind, including dedicated gaming keys on the
 pad. Both these handsets run the Symbian operating system, and so
 should be compatible with text to speech conversion products such as
 Talks, developed by Nuance.

<p> 
 Whether you're a 25 year-old banker in the City of London or a 55
 year-old farmer in a remote area of China, full and equal access to the
 internet will help you do better business. However, while an increasing
 number of people in the UK can enjoy full and equal access to the web,
 many millions of people around the world have limited, if any, access
 at all.
</p>
<p> 
 I recently travelled to Beijing as a member of a European Union
 delegation to China. The Sino European Systems Usability Network
 ( <a href="http://www.sesun-usability.org/">http://www.sesun-usability.org/</a>
 ) is an EU-funded project that aims to link European and Chinese IT
 practitioners and academics interested in software usability, user-
 centred design, accessibility and human-computer interaction. The
 conference, entitled 'Citizen Centric Information Society', was
 inaugurated by senior representatives from both the EU delegation in
 Beijing and China's Ministry for Information Industry.
</p>
<p> 
 The purpose of the conference was to formally include usability in the
 development of a citizen-centric information society in China. There
 are three main aims to this work: delivering public services through
 electronic means; integrating the rural poor into the information
 society; and providing better user experiences to citizens.
</p>
<p> 
 I was asked to make a keynote speech about the legal requirement for
 web accessibility in the UK. This is a subject I have presented to
 conferences around the world many times before. The main thrust of
 my talk was how the UK people recognize that disabled people have
 rights to full and equal participation in society and that we extend this
 to right of access to online information. I explained how our Disability
 Discrimination Act seeks to protect the rights of disabled people and
 pointed out its weaknesses, stressing that the business case and
 excellent prospects for high return-on-investment can be a stronger
 incentive to UK businesses than the law.
</p>
<p> 
 It's a clich&#233;, but I suspect that much of my presentation was lost in
 translation. The conference facilities included simultaneous translation
 from Mandarin into English and vice versa.  However, I strongly
 suspect that a great deal of what the Chinese presenters were saying
 was not fully translated, and I wonder how much of my presentation
 made it into Mandarin, despite my effort to keep my language clear
 and simple.
</p>
<p> 
 Immediately following my presentation, CUI Huipin, from the China
 Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF) described an impressive range of
 Chinese Government initiatives that aim to provide China's disabled
 people with full and equal access to the growing digital economy. The
 rhetoric ('a more beautiful tomorrow for disabled people') was
 eloquent and delivered with such confidence that for a brief moment I
 wondered why the Chinese government needed advice from the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 However, I've learned to read between the lines of Government
 rhetoric. A long list of initiatives is of little value unless backed with
 action. Initiatives can only be measured in terms of their impact on the
 lives of the disabled people they seek to support.  Without testimony
 from disabled people themselves it is very difficult to gauge how far-
 reaching China's initiatives have been. One particular statistic quoted
 in CUI Huipin's presentation caught my attention. In fact, it set alarm
 bells ringing. We were informed that 82 million Chinese people are
 disabled. This may sound like a large number of people and it is, but it
 only amounts to just over six per cent of the Chinese population. This
 figure is too low.
</p>
<p> 
 Generally, 10 to 15 per cent of any population is disabled. I am
 concerned that large numbers of China's poor, rural, disabled
 population are not being reached by the exciting initiatives, and that
 the official government rhetoric belies the vast digital divide that exists
 in China. This fact doesn't set China apart, however.  We have
 precisely the same issue in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 UK official government statistics on the numbers of disabled people in
 this country - 8.2 million - are far lower than the estimates - generally
 in excess of 10 million - made by organisations representing disabled
 people and the Disability Rights Commission. Like China, we need to
 match our rhetoric with initiatives that bring positive changes to the
 lives of all our disabled people, not just those we find it easy to count.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK differs from China in so many ways, language and culture
 being the most obvious. But when it comes to empowering our poorer
 and disabled people, similar challenges lie ahead of us. Before my trip
 to China, I had thought that the 'support' would be one-way. However,
 if the Chinese Government can match its rhetoric with initiatives that
 lift its disabled people out of the digital divide, then we have
 something important to learn from them.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: An International Hothouse Of Ideasby Adrian Higginbotham.
</h3>
<p> 
 The International Camp on Communication and Computers (ICC)
 2007 in Finland was the brainchild of the University of Karlsruhe
 Germany and the University of Linz, Austria, each with centres
 supporting visually impaired students in integrated higher education.
</p>
<p> 
 ICC camps give students the chance to develop the essential skills and
 experience they will need to succeed in independent study while
 mixing with peers from around Europe. Now in its fourteenth year, the
 ICC began in Austria in 1994 where it was hosted for four years before
 beginning roaming around Europe, playing host to as many as 150
 students from up to 30 countries for two weeks each summer.
</p>
<p> 
 This year the camp was held at the Arla institute, a post-16 vocational
 college for vision impaired and disabled people in Finland. Students
 between the ages of 14 and 21 attended, along with volunteer staff
 from each participating country who took part in half-day workshops
 on more than 50 subjects.
</p>
<p> 
 This year, as previously, topics were wide ranging, from sports to
 running an internet radio station, from crafts such as pottery and
 macram&#233; to word processing and website building, from satellite
 navigation systems to multimedia players for work and leisure. And of
 course, we learned about the traditions of Finnish Sauna.
</p>
<p> 
 This was my first camp and although I had heard of ICC previously, I
 knew very little about the overall aims and even less of what to expect.
 My role was as a volunteer member of staff, running timetabled
 workshops on blogging and accessing a computer when away from
 home and your usual assistive technology. The workshops, lead by two
 tutors for groups of six students, were hard enough work in themselves,
 but the challenges and the rewards came outside the classroom -
 chatting to students at the barbecue evenings, playing Showdown in the
 games room or taking part in the online games tournaments.
</p>
<p> 
 Comparing notes with teachers and staff from other countries at meal
 times and finding out about education systems and provision of
 technology was very interesting. Did you know, for example, that all
 pupils in the Netherlands are taught Braille from an early age and are
 given computers with Braille displays for both home and school?
</p>
<p> 
 One fruitful outcome of such a conversation was an impromptu
 workshop on using Microsoft Powerpoint to create presentations with a
 screen reader which the French tutor of the course on Powerpoint for
 screen magnifiers and I presented. She hadn't been able to offer the
 course as she didn't have time to translate her notes into English - the
 language of the camp - and I was already running two other
 workshops. By working together though, we took five students through
 most of what is usually a two-day course in little more three hours.

 Each country's participants at the camp are supported by a local
 sponsor, which for the UK is LOOK
 ( <a href="http://www.look-uk.org/">http://www.look-uk.org/</a>
 ), the 'National federation of families with visually impaired children.'
