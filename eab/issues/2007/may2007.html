<h3 id="i89-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Expert Tips For Accessible Web Content Available On Dvd.</h3>
<p> 
 A host of experts including Anne McGuire MP, Minister for disabled
 people, have contributed to a new DVD that advocates web
 accessibility and provides best practice tips and demonstrations to web
 designers and commissioners in all sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 A World Denied aims to influence decision makers in the public,
 private and third sectors about the need for accessible websites. It is
 targeted at web managers, human resource departments, budget holders
 and programmers, among others.
</p>
<p> 
 Billed as 'Web Accessibility - The Movie', the film is comprised of
 interviews with key players in the field such as barrister Robin Allen
 QC, Julie Howell, Director of Accessibility at website development
 company Fortune Cookie and Disability Rights Commissioner Dame
 Jane Campbell.
</p>
<p> 
 Interviews are interspersed with clips of demonstrations of the use of
 assistive technology to navigate the web by AbilityNet's Head of
 Accessibility Services Robin Christopherson, who is vision impaired.
 Christopherson is also one of the film's executive producers, along
 with Martin Greenwood, Programme Manager of the 'Socitm Insight'
 team, which is responsible for promoting good practice in the design of
 local authority websites.
</p>
<p> 
 "It covers all bases, the legal side and the business case,"
 Christopherson told E-Access Bulletin. "It's a powerful self-contained
 tool to leverage budgets and raise awareness," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Christopherson, the medium of a DVD was chosen to
 allow people to watch it in their own time and to include those that do
 not use a computer often. He also said a film would broaden the appeal
 of the subject matter. "We're not discounting the possibility of offering
 it streamed online," said Christopherson.
</p>
<p> 
 The DVD has been produced by Society of IT Management (Socitm), a
 professional body for UK local authorities, AbilityNet, the charity
 focusing on access to IT by disabled people and Boilerhouse, a
 communications company. A World Denied costs 50 pounds but is free
 to subscribers of Socitm Insight. It can be ordered from:

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Online Guide To London Underground Launched.An online resource of information on travelling on the London
Underground (LU) train network for people with vision and other
mobility and sensory impairments has gone live.
The LU 'Nationwide access register,' is currently available on the
website of Direct Enquiries
( <a href="http://www.directenquiries.com/">http://www.directenquiries.com/</a>
 ),a UK company providing online searchable resources for access
information on businesses and services. The service will be integrated
with the existing Transport for London Journey Planner over the next
six to nine months.
</h3>
<p> 
 The Direct Enquiries service enables users to make searches by
 clicking on any number of 17 logos on the home page representing
 their needs or disability to ensure the most relevant results. Users then
 type in a London station, business or service, its location, or both. The
 details returned in a search on an underground station, for example,
 include information on the number of steps, lifts, escalators, walking
 distances and gap width between the platform and the train.
 The site also allows passengers to find out detailed information about
 all 252 stations, such as whether staff are trained to help with
 improving disabled access, seats, telephones and how many stairs there
 are. And the resource provides detailed text only information on
 interchanges between station platforms as well as street-level access
 information.
 The Transport for London Journey Planner will include personalisation
 features, removing the need for users to tick the same options each
 time they visit, and will provide live travel information feeds, LU's
 Accessibility and Inclusion Manager Wayne Trevor told E-Access
 Bulletin. "Accurate information is key to improving confidence in
 travelling," he said.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Voice Technology Helps Pilot Complete Record Breaking Flight.Voice technology has helped blind adventurer Miles Hilton-Barber set
a new record by flying a microlight aircraft from Biggin Hill in
England to Sydney in Australia. The flight, which followed the route of
an air race staged in 1919, aims to raise 1 million pounds to help the
fight against preventable blindness in developing countries.
Hilton-Barber navigated the 13,500 miles over 21 countries using
instruments specially adapted to deliver voice output of the aircraft's
altitude, direction, and wind speed. He entered the readings into an
onboard computer using a wireless keyboard strapped to his leg.
He was accompanied by a sighted co-pilot, who was responsible for
speaking to control towers and providing back-up in case of an
emergency. The journey began on March 7 and took 55 days to
complete, requiring the pilots to deal with extreme weather conditions
such as heavy snow in the mountains of Lebanon, and tropical
rainstorms.
The flight will raise funds for Seeing Is Believing
( <a href="http://www.seeingisbelieving.org.uk/">http://www.seeingisbelieving.org.uk/</a>
 ),a project run by Standard Chartered Bank to promote treatment of eye
cataracts in Asia and Africa.

 accessible audio captcha tool at:
 <a href="http://www.sperling.com/examples/captcha/">http://www.sperling.com/examples/captcha/</a>

 last year ( see:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/cap1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/cap1</a>
 ). If you read it and then go to the bottom you can make a comment, the
 comment form has a captcha which in my humble opinion is superior
 to yours for the following reasons:
</p>
<p> 
 1. It does not use a wheelchair as a symbol for playing the audio (for a
 non vision impaired wheelchair user the use of the symbol in this
 context is confusing at the least).
 2. As far as I could tell the wheelchair symbol is not in the tab
 sequence so I could not get to it without using a mouse.
 3. When I click on the wheelchair I then have to tab to the input field
 before I can type in the code even though the obvious place for the
 cursor is in the input field.
 4. I like the use of the phonetic alphabet but I recognise that that is
 more a matter of taste.
 5. Something I have heard on other sites, which neither of us does, is to
 add some background noise (Google now does this). This is designed
 to stop a speech to text engine being used to automate the input. I
 suspect that this is only really needed if you feel the site is going to
 have a denial of service type attack.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Focus- Web Accessibility
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Overcoming The Barriers To Accessible Websitesby John Morse.
</h3>
<p> 
 Achieving a high level of website accessibility requires a higher than
 average commitment from the organisation in question, as well as
 additional effort on the part of the developer and designer to allow for
 adequate planning, design and testing of the solution.
</p>
<p> 
 The time, cost and effort can be hard to justify. Since a well designed
 site should be "transparently" accessible and usable, the return on
 investment (ROI) can be hard to sell to decision makers, who may not
 see the immediate benefits of communicating your message to a wider
 audience in an accessible manner. It does, however, require a change in
 the focus of the organisation to accept that there is a business case for
 accessible or usable websites.
</p>
<p> 
 Often the people responsible for the web presence of the organisation
 understand this, convincing senior management further removed from
 the technology can take more time and effort than is available,
 particularly when trying to achieve aggressive deadlines for delivery.
 This means that the project team have to work on two or more fronts,
 delays are introduced while departments wait for approval and the risk
 of failure or limited ROI is increased. Shortcuts and half compromises
 are easier to justify and the quality criteria of the original project are
 not met as the path of least resistance is taken to meet short term,
 nearsighted deadlines.
</p>
<p> 
 The following outline illustrates the issues that can arise in a typical
 project lifecycle.
</p>
<p> 
 An organisation approaches a supplier with a list of requirements of the
 site or application; often this list is made up of features that they have
 seen on other sites, which might be considered as "cool" features.
</p>
<p> 
 Somewhere on that list, often hidden towards the bottom, will be a line
 requiring the solution to be accessible and usable, with no real
 understanding of the implications of achieving an accessible website.
 Once project costs are supplied, the organisation - faced with the
 additional costs and time needed to comply with the accessibility
 standard - may lose its enthusiasm for delivering accessibility,
 particularly if faced with losing some of the cool tools.
</p>
<p> 
 Then there are the corporate identity guidelines, which are often
 developed by marketing teams for print materials and applied by
 design agencies. In the majority of cases print-based design guides
 simply do not work when applied to online digital media; colours, font
 sizes and logo designs are rarely appropriate for accessible online
 digital display. The overriding priority of these designs is to maintain
 the corporate image. When faced with an accessible or usable online
 solution which deviates from this corporate identity, then accessibility
 and usability requirements, are normally sacrificed.
</p>
<p> 
 Then the customer is faced with controlling the way they release the
 content to the web in a more structured way, in the case of using a
 Content Management System (CMS), this will involve a workflow
 which will require checks before publishing. The changes to the
 business process are rarely welcomed by the customer's internal
 content providers.
</p>
<p> 
 Suddenly the time cost and effort needed to develop, design and
 maintain an accessible and usable solution are harder to sell to the
 budget controllers in an organisation who see little immediate ROI in
 developing a fully accessible solution for what is considered a minority
 market, the requirements for an accessible solution get reduced to
 "where possible", which usually means where it is easy.
</p>
<p> 
 To prevent these issues arising, senior management buy-in must be
 achieved; once convinced of the benefits of accessible and usable
 solutions, they can back the additional effort and associated spend on
 delivering accessible services.
</p>
<p> 
 A more usable and accessible site can result in better customer
 experience, visitors can find what they need easier and quicker, as a
 result the organisation's staff are not called upon to answer routine
 calls from the customer and are free to handle other issues and improve
 the organisations effectiveness.
</p>
<p> 
 Also, the effort spent on creating a better online service can result in an
 increased public profile and an improved satisfaction rating which in
 turn results in increased visitor statistics and increased efficiency and
 value for money. These benefits are difficult to sell at the start of a
 project but are desirable for any organisation.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Access To Work?By Dr Peter Wheeler.
</h3>
<p> 
 The Informatics Research institute (IRIS) at the University of Salford
 has won funding from the European Social Fund (ESF) to conduct
 research into the barriers faced by many disabled people caused by
 inaccessible web content design.
</p>
<p> 
 E-government has brought most public services to the web, although
 the question of how accessible such material is appears to be an issue
 of variable consistency.
</p>
<p> 
 This research project
 ( <a href="http://www.iris.salford.ac.uk/ediscrimination/">http://www.iris.salford.ac.uk/ediscrimination/</a>
 ) aims to provide local authorities in the North West region of England
 with employment-related information on eDiscrimination. This will
 assist their implementation of the new public duty enshrined in the
 2005 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).
</p>
<p> 
 The North West of England has been chosen to host this research
 because this area has been identified as one where a disproportionate
 number of disabled people are outside the labour market compared
 with other regions. Although the project is fixed geographically,
 nevertheless as with many internet based applications, the results will
 be of interest and relevance to many providers of internet resources.
</p>
<p> 
 Clearly, if government policy in terms of increasing equality of
 opportunity for disabled people to enter the workforce is to succeed,
 then all forms of eDiscrimination will require removal especially at
 labour market entry points.
</p>
<p> 
 The research team includes Dr David Kreps, an expert on web
 accessibility and Dr Peter Wheeler whose research specialises in issues
 related to business employment and disability. The Salford team has
 approached the method of conducting the research from an interesting
 perspective. Rather than attempting to categorise barriers to access
 based on specific impairments, for example, those faced by visually
 impaired people, the research will focus on barriers which are firmly
 rooted in technology. The starting position for the Salford team is that
 the web can be made accessible to all. However, if web content is not
 designed to appropriate web content accessibility guidelines, then this
 can disable access for adaptive computer users. The research is
 directed towards the relative accessibility of employment websites and
 online job application forms.
</p>
<p> 
 In the first instance, a representative sample of prominent employment-
 related websites will be audited to provide a benchmark to determine
 the general level of compliance to web content accessibility guidelines.
 Industry and public sector organisations will also be invited to
 participate in developing best practice approaches. However, perhaps
 the most significant research partners will be people with impairments
 who use adaptive computer equipment to access internet resources.
</p>
<p> 
 Impaired people who use either adaptive hardware or software will join
 the research and it is their experiences which will help guide the
 project. Individuals will be interviewed to gather general information
 on what problems they encounter when accessing the web, and then
 asked to carry out two tasks on a designated employment related
 website.
</p>
<p> 
 The results of the research will be disseminated to all participants in
 late 2007. Hence this research does not assign any barriers to inclusion
 as assigned to an individual impairment, but regards the disability and
 discrimination impaired people face as aspects of inaccessible and
 inappropriate design.

 e-discrimination project' at Salford Business School at the University
