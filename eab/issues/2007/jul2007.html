 Section One: News.
</p>
<h3 id="i91-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Training Portal For Personal Computing Launches.</h3>
<p> 
 What is thought to be the biggest online training portal created to date
 for learning about assistive technology, featuring e-learning and live
 online tutoring, has been launched by the charity AbilityNet.
</p>
<p> 
 The AT training portal
 ( <a href="http://www.abilitynettraining.org">http://www.abilitynettraining.org</a>
 ) is based on the open source learning platform Moodle
 (<a href="http://moodle.org">http://moodle.org</a>
 ). Courses available range from a general introduction to assistive
 technology; through courses on healthy computing; how technology
 can help people with dyslexia; access to mobile phones; and courses on
 specific technologies such as the Jaws and Thunder screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 One year's access to all courses currently costs 100 pounds per user,
 and single courses can be purchased for 25 pounds, with online
 payment possible using PayPal. One or two courses, such as one on
 making your computer talk in Windows, are free to access.
</p>
<p> 
 David Banes, acting Chief Executive of AbilityNet, said that since the
 service went live at the beginning of June, just over 100 users had
 signed up "from all sorts of backgrounds."
</p>
<p> 
 "There is interest from individuals with a disability in receiving
 personal online support from a tutor since the cost of having someone
 come in to train you is high," Banes told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as individuals, organisations such as schools and learning
 centres have shown a strong interest in the site, he said. "They may
 have a lot of assistive technology, but staff only use it infrequently. So
 they may use us for Thunder refresher training, for example. They may
 have had a half-day training in the past but need an update."
</p>
<p> 
 Future developments could include courses in languages other than
 English, particularly if partners came forward to assist with translation,
 Banes said.
</p>
<h3 id="i91-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Guide Aims To Push Accessibility Up The It Agenda.</h3>
<p> 
 A free, comprehensive guide published this month outlines steps IT
 managers should take to ensure staff and service users with a disability
 can access all internal and public facing technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 'The IT directors' guide to accessible IT,' aimed at the public and
 private sectors, explains the needs of people with temporary and
 permanent disabilities; and the steps that IT managers can take to move
 accessibility higher up the corporate agenda. The guide also explains
 how staff and the public can be assisted by technology and what
 software, information and devices are available.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is the law," said report author and Publisher of Ability Magazine
 John Lamb. "You can't recruit a disabled person if they cannot work in
 your organisation."
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, some 50 per cent of disabled people in employment
 whose work life could be improved by simple enhancements to
 desktop systems struggle on unaided, says the guide. The need for IT
 Managers to take action is strengthened by the fact some disabled staff
 prefer not to describe themselves as such and consequently will not ask
 their managers for "special treatment."
</p>
<p> 
 "It's not expensive - most adjustments that need to be made to make
 IT systems accessible can be found in Windows," Lamb said.
</p>
<p> 
 The guide also highlights any major adjustments to IT systems to
 enhance accessibility should be made at the earliest possible stage.
 "The most important thing is to make systems accessible when
 planning and designing systems," said Lamb. "And to convince people
 to include accessibility in their checklist when they're [buying] a new
 system. Then people can't say 'this is not a reasonable adjustment'
 because it's too expensive.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is a lack of easily digestible information on accessibility.
 Something was needed that isn't only for the tecchies," Lamb said.
 Organisations that advised on the guide and are helping distribute it
 are: the Government's Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council, the
 Society of IT Management; National Computing Centre; British
 Computer Society Elite Group and CIO Connect.
</p>
<p> 
 The guide was sponsored by Royal Mail in association with the
 Information Technologists' Company. The guide can be downloaded

<h3 id="i91-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: New Accessibility Guidelines Will Be More "Testable".</h3>
<p> 
 The long-awaited second version of Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG), the global benchmarks of web accessibility, will
 include far more detailed practical help for designers, a conference for
 public sector web teams heard this month.
</p>
<p> 
 WCAG 1.0, the most recent set of guidelines from the World Wide
 Web Consortium (W3C), was released in 1999. WCAG 1.0 suggests
 websites achieve one of three levels of accessibility from a minimum
 of level A, to levels AA and AAA, by meeting several of its 14
 "checkpoints."
</p>
<p> 
 But the forthcoming second version, WCAG 2.0, has been updated to
 make checkpoints for accessibility more "testable," said W3C Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Steering Council and WCAG working
 group
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/waiabout">http://fastlink.headstar.com/waiabout</a>
 ) member Alex Li, at this month's conference "Building the perfect
 council website,"
 ( <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/council07">http://www.headstar-events.com/council07</a>
 ) hosted annually by E-Government Bulletin and the Society of IT
 Management (Socitm).
</p>
<p> 
 "How do you know you've passed [colour contrast checkpoints]?" said
 Li of WCAG 1.0. "Ask everyone with a colour deficit?" he said. To
 address the issue, checkpoint 1.4.3 of the updated guidelines, for
 example, will say text and images must have a contrast ratio of five to
 one, said Li.
</p>
<p> 
 Senior web accessibility consultant at the RNIB, Donna Smillie,
 agreed. "One of the nice things about WCAG 2.0 is criteria are much
 more testable than was the case for many checkpoints with WCAG
 1.0," said Smillie. "It'll be easier to standardise testing of many aspects
 of the guidelines," she told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 Other changes include two less checkpoints in WCAG 2.0 - there will
 be 12 rather than 14 - but the three levels of attainable accessibility, A,
 AA an AAA will remain in the second version.
 Also, web 2.0 features such as interactive mapping, blogs and social
 networking sites will be taken into consideration said Li. "The way we
 use web content is very different [now]. As a result a lot of these things
 need to be updated in WCAG 2.0," he told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 "WCAG 1.0 is still sound. We're not changing its principles but we're
 recognising changes in the web and updating them accordingly," said
 Li. Details of all documents relating to the WCAG 2.0 working draft
 are found at:
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20</a>
 . The guidelines will be finally released by early 2008.
</p>

 hosted by E-Access Bulletin sister publication
 E-Government Bulletin and the Society of IT Management (Socitm).

<p>  One of the world's largest social networking websites is to launch an alternative to security test captchas, inaccessible to vision
 impaired users because they use images of text and numbers. Facebook
 now allows vision impaired users to register their mobile phone
 number to verify their identity when registering a user account to
 receive a text message with a verification code. When the code is
 entered, the user's identity is confirmed and such security tests
 avoided:

<p>  Terry Robinson, of Describe Online writes in response to Lynn Holdsworth's comments on the London
 Underground guide in the Directory Enquiries site last issue: "I
 understand this is based on the accessibility booklet which was
 developed some time ago and, whilst it clearly states how many steps
 there are and what's involved in moving through each station, it stops
 short of telling you how to do it.
</p>
<p> 
 "The Describe Online service, on the other hand, tells you what the
 station is like and how to use it. Sadly, at the time of writing, we don't
 have guides to all stations, but hope we can provide this essential
 service in due course.
</p>

<h3 id="i91-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Course Response:</h3>
<p>  Phia Damsma from Sonokids, an international organisation aimed at developing web based educational materials for
 vision impaired people, writes in response to the following request
 from the June issue: "Norman Waddington writes on behalf of an
 acquaintance looking for a web design course suitable for a blind
 person with additional disabilities."
</p>
<p> 
 Phia writes: "The information does not say if the acquaintance really
 wants to do a course, or if he is just interested in creating his own
 website. If the latter is the case, a free 'sonoplanet' website would be
 ideal. It comes with a fully accessible web content management
 system, which assists in the creation of a fully accessible website. Each
 web account includes a guestbook, blog, photo album and poll. We
 will gladly provide Norman's acquaintance with such a free website
 account. The web address starts with
 <a href="http://www.sonoplanet.com">http://www.sonoplanet.com</a>

 and he should choose a name or word. Please let me know and I will
 prepare an account.
</p>
<p> 
 And Jacob Kruger, AKA "Blind Biker" also responds. He writes:
 "Although I'm not sure how accessible it would be to someone who has
 no previous experience related to web design or layout, there is a very
 good website with various tutorials related to web development and
 design at:
 <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">http://www.w3schools.com</a>
 . The tutorials are freely available, and while somewhat technical, they

</h3>
<p> 
 In terms of popular culture, the world has changed since 1999: pop
 group the Spice Girls were at the peak of their fame; Bill Clinton was
 President of the US Government; and we downloaded our music from
 Napster for free. The internet has changed too, but at least it is still
 relevant.
</p>
<p> 
 Alex Li, Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Steering Council and Web
 Content Working Group (WCAG) Working Group member, invited
 delegates of this month's conference "Building the perfect council
 website,"
 ( <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/council07/">http://www.headstar-events.com/council07/</a>
 ), in London, to look back to what was "hot" in 1999, the year that also
 saw the release of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
 version 1.0.
</p>
<p> 
 The WCAG guidelines are now used across the globe to shape
 inclusive website design and development to ensure accessibility to all
 users with a disability and users of assistive technologies.  The
 guidelines recommend that website developers comply with three
 levels of accessibility ranging from level 'A' for minimum
 accessibility; level 'AA' or the rarely achieved level 'AAA.' These
 will remain in WCAG 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 This second version, subject to several delays since its inception, is the
 result of five years collaborative work between the WCAG working
 group and individuals; researchers; disability organisations; people
 with a disability; educational institutions; industry; web developers;
 and government. The working draft can be seen at:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag2complete">http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag2complete</a>

 and has many supporting documents to accompany it at:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag2intro">http://fastlink.headstar.com/wcag2intro</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Since WCAG was first conceived, the web has become a more
 colourful place, with blossoming virtual worlds; countless blogs; social
 networking sites and interactive digital maps. The second version, due
 by the beginning of next year, has had to adapt accordingly. "The way
 we use content is very different. Collaborative content such as
 MySpace, YouTube and Google Maps are very rich in content," said
 Li. "As a result a lot of these things needed to be updated in WCAG
 2.0."
</p>
<p> 
 "One thing to ask yourself is what [web-based] interaction are we
 doing?" Li asked the public sector delegates. " - Live traffic
 information? Online education? Online tax payment? Blogging?
 Podcasting? - these are all web 2.0 activities. If you are, you have to
 look at WCAG 2.0. WCAG 1.0 would slow you down significantly,"
 said Li. "WCAG 1.0 is still sound. We're not changing its principles
 but we're recognising changes in the web and updating them
 accordingly."
</p>
<p> 
 Not only has the web expanded greatly, but so has the choice of
 assistive technologies people use to access it. "WCAG 2.0 is much
 more flexible in terms of technology," said Li. "In Version 2.0,
 everything is written in such a way that is technology neutral," he said.
 He said in WCAG 2.0, for example, there is less emphasis on the use
 of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, used by web authors to define
 document presentation and allow the same page to be rendered on-
 screen, in print, by voice when read by a speech-based browser or
 screen reader and on Braille-based, tactile devices.
 Perhaps the most important change from WCAG 1.0 is that under each
 guideline, there will be so-called "success criteria" describing what
 must be achieved to conform to each guideline, similar to the
 "checkpoints" of WCAG 1.0. Each success criterion is written as a
 statement that will be either true or false when specific web content is
 tested against it. As ever, while some can be tested by computer
 programs, others must be tested by qualified human testers and
 occasionally, a combination of those two may be used.
 Donna Smillie, Senior Web Accessibility Consultant at the RNIB, said
 changes to the guidelines would impact on the accessibility testing that
 takes place at the charity, which tests and accredits websites as part of
 one of its services. "From the point of view of the RNIB one of the
 nice things about WCAG 2.0 is criteria are much more testable than
 was the case for many checkpoints with WCAG 1.0," said Smillie.
 "It'll be easier to standardise testing of many aspects of the
 guidelines," she told delegates.

<p> 
 In February last year, E-Access Bulletin reported on development
 plans for 'SpeakOn', a hardware device aimed at providing access to
 selected news and entertainment audio web content without the need
 for high IT skills. The project is being headed by assistive technology
 charity a-technic
 ( <a href="http://www.a-technic.net">http://www.a-technic.net</a>
 ). Planned content included DAISY-formatted books, MP3 music files,
 internet radio stations, podcasts and other web site content including
 online newspapers.
</p>
<p> 
 Since that time, the project has split into two elements: SpeakOn which
 is a free software product, now available, that anyone can download
 and run on their PC; and the original concept of a hardware box, now
 codenamed 'Pipistrelle' and still in development. This month, E-Access
 Bulletin interviews the creator and developer of SpeakOn, Isaac Porat,
 and finds out exactly what is planned for this new technology.

 Q: What is SpeakOn and what can it do?
</p>
<p> 
 A: SpeakOn is free, self-voicing software for finding, retrieving and
 listening to media.
</p>
<p> 
 The E-Access Bulletin news item about SpeakOn in February 2006
 talked mainly about a self-contained box, but we subsequently decided
 to launch SpeakOn first as software for the PC. This software caters for
 people who are comfortable with computers but are looking for an easy
 and relaxing way to enjoy media.
</p>
<p> 
 SpeakOn was launched in June 2006 (almost exactly a year ago) and
 has had a number of major upgrades since. It now covers pretty well all
 specialized media services for blind people in the UK, as well as
 general types of media such as internet radio and podcasts. Much work
 has been done to improve the user interface for ease of use and more
 features in handling general formats and media types have been added.
</p>
<p> 
 In its most recent feature release last month, support is provided to
 browse and listen directly to the latest audio narrated streaming service
 provided by the talking newspaper organisation
 ( TNAUK - <a href="http://www.tnauk.org.uk/">http://www.tnauk.org.uk/</a>
 ). It also closes some gaps in SpeakOn's media cover by handling CDs of
 MP3 books such as those supplied by Calibre and support for audio
 CDs. The album and track names are spoken to the user if available on
 the internet repository. Although SpeakOn is free for use, it is not open
 source. This is because we want to maintain control over its
 development path.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What first triggered the development of SpeakOn?
</p>
<p> 
 A: SpeakOn was born out of my own frustrations as a blind person in
 finding, retrieving and playing media such as music, books,
 newspapers and magazines using conventional PC access technology. I
 was tired of memorising endless shortcut keys for different
 applications and wanted a more relaxing way of listening to media
 rather than having to sit upright in front of my computer. I started to
 develop SpeakOn essentially for myself to address these issues.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What unique features does SpeakOn offer that differentiate it from
 other products and tools already on the market?
</p>
<p> 
 A: Currently, SpeakOn contains two applications; the first one, the
 'Media Centre' covers a range of general purpose and special media
 services for the blind. All these media can be accessed by conventional
 means, but SpeakOn offers a uniform approach and therefore ease of
 use and speed for finding, retrieving and playing the media it supports.
</p>
<p> 
 The second application includes a player for the popular 'Last.FM'
 internet music service. The players available already for this service
 are to my knowledge essentially not accessible for blind users.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What has been most challenging about developing the SpeakOn
 software?
</p>
<p> 
 A: SpeakOn is all about using the same interface, regardless of the
 media used. In the real world, the various media are available in
 different locations remotely and on the user's computer. These media
 come in different text and audio formats, and a great challenge has
 always been for the software to do as much work as possible 'under the
 hood' so that to the user it all appears the same.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: How have you overcome these challenges?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I started with the basic interface model and a range of supported
 media. Feedback from users started to arrive after the launch of
 SpeakOn in late June 2006. There are a number of enthusiastic fans
 who are prepared to stay in touch on a regular basis and test new
 features of the program, giving advice and suggestions; this proved
 invaluable and I am grateful to them.
</p>
<p> 
 Over the past year, the user interface has been gradually improved and
 more features based on user feedback added. I realise that as SpeakOn
 grows, more help will be needed from the community in providing
 links to media resources, documentation and just spreading the word.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: How many people use SpeakOn?
</p>
<p> 
 A: There have been over 1,000 public downloads so far. Now that the
 features and support for specialised media are generally complete, I
 feel that SpeakOn is ready for a bigger audience.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: Is SpeakOn a type of screen reader?
</p>
<p> 
 A: Most blind people know about screen readers or magnifiers and
 their use in a Windows-type system. Screen readers try to enable
 access to conventional programs designed for sighted users with a
 varying degree of success, depending on how the mainstream software
 is written.
</p>
<p> 
 SpeakOn is different in its interface and approach in that it has no
 visual interface.  It is designed from the ground up for input by a
 limited number of keys and speech is built in for communicating with
 the user. The interface is optimised for easy media access.
</p>
<p> 
 SpeakOn is not competing against screen readers as screen readers are
 an essential tool for everyday use in accessing mainstream software.
 SpeakOn just addresses a specific problem in providing a quick and
 relaxing way to access media from the comfort of your armchair.
 Because of its unconventional approach, it may not suit everybody.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: Can SpeakOn be used by organisations as well as by individuals?
</p>
<p> 
 A: The SpeakOn licence does not distinguish between use by
 individuals or organisations, and any organisation is welcome to train
 users to access media using SpeakOn if they wish.
</p>
<p> 
 We are currently collaborating with screenreader.net, the distributor of
 the Thunder screen reader, to provide free computer access for the
 broadest user-base possible. We recognise that we both are providing
 products that complement each other.
</p>
<p> 
 We are also collaborating with organisations that provide specialized
 online content, notably TNAUK and the Seeing Ear Library. Other
 online content such as the Soundings magazine and ACB radio for
 example can be accessed using SpeakOn with its standard interfaces.
 DAISY and MP3 books distributed by various organisations can also
 be easily played, and we are in discussion with various other
 organisations in the UK and the US about possible further
 developments and provision of content.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What is planned for the future of SpeakOn?
</p>
<p> 
 A: SpeakOn so far has been aimed at people who are reasonably
 comfortable using computers. This version of SpeakOn will always be
 there and will be developed further to include more media and possibly
 applications beyond media as well.
</p>
<p> 
 However, I am currently developing a version of SpeakOn specifically
 for people who have limited knowledge of computers. This version
 will be offered to the public in the next few months for the Windows
 operating system.
</p>
<p> 
 It is recognised that some people will never use computers and to that
 end we at a-technic would like to offer the 'easy' version of SpeakOn or
 similar, operating in its own box. Together with my a-technic
 colleagues, Chris Mairs and John Batty, I have started to work on this
 project, codenamed Pipistrelle.  SpeakOn already runs under the Linux
 operating system but more work needs to be done to make this a
 practical proposition. Linux is free and can be tailored to do
 specifically what SpeakOn requires for its functionality running on a
 dedicated hardware.
</p>
<p> 
 In its own box, Pipistrelle like the existing SpeakOn software running
 on a standard laptop, will communicate through WiFi and broadband,
 using a simple numerical keypad or a similar device for input and will
 connect to standard speakers and HiFi.
</p>
<p> 
 For this stage in the development, specific hardware will be required
 and we will need to form partnerships with companies and
 organisations that will help us by manufacturing, distributing and
 supporting the product.
</p>
