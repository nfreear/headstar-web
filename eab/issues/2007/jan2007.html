<h3 id="i85-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Italian Government To Explore Route Finder Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 A handheld device for blind people to independently reach their
 destination on foot is to go on trial this month in Turin, Italy.
</p>
<p> 
 Conceived and funded by the regional government of Piedmont, 'Easy
 walk' uses a Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled mobile phone
 to provide audible directions. Once launched in August, it will be free
 to use.
</p>
<p> 
 The navigational device tells users the address their current location as
 well as directions, 'left,' 'right,' 'straight on,' and so on, until they
 reach their destination. For users that are stuck or lost, the system
 allows them to call a contact centre where an operator sees their
 position on a computer screen and guides them on their journey over
 the phone.
</p>
<p> 
 The pilot follows a campaign by the local branch of the Unione Italiana
 dei Ciechi (Italian Blind Union -
 <a href="http://www.uiciechi.it/piemonte/">http://www.uiciechi.it/piemonte/</a>
 ) to increase the safety of crossings in the region.
</p>
<p> 
 Problems with the accuracy of the precision of users' positions have
 been smoothed out, financial advisor at the Italian Blind and
 co-developer of the device, Federico Borgna told E-Access Bulletin,
 although there are improvements yet to be made. The GPS, for
 example, fails to work under tram wires, said Borgna.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, users will be able to personalise the device, adding the names
 of shops or offices on routes that are then saved, for example.
 Developers also aim for the Easy Walk to provide directions to users
 anywhere in Italy or France.
</p>
<p> 
 The device has been developed by the Italian wireless technology
 company Il Village
 ( <a href="http://www.ilvillage.it/ilVillage/">http://www.ilvillage.it/ilVillage/</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i85-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Ibm Builds Bridges For Commercial Screen Readers.</h3>
<p> 
 Software products based on open source technology could become
 more accessible to users of commercial screen readers following the
 release of a new set of programming interfaces by technology giant
 IBM.
</p>
<p> 
 Users of commercial screen readers, which are usually developed for
 Microsoft operating systems, often have problems accessing computer
 applications that run on rival operating systems such as Linux, which
 are based on open source software.
</p>
<p> 
 Collectively known as iAccessible2, the new interfaces released by
 IBM are the basic building blocks for programmers to join open source
 software products to Microsoft-based screen readers so that they work
 together seamlessly.
</p>
<p> 
 IBM has released the interfaces to the Free Standards Group, a non-
 profit organisation that will maintain iAccessible2 as an open standard
 that can be freely used by developers. A blog maintained by the
 technical director of the Free Standards Group is available here:
 <a href="http://ianmurdock.com/?page_id=215">http://ianmurdock.com/?page_id=215</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 The move is seen as a significant step towards building bridges
 between the most widely used commercial screen reader products and
 the open source community, which develops products that are often
 less expensive and more secure than those based on so-called
 "proprietary" technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 Roger Wilson-Hinds, developer of Thunder, the screen reader that is
 free to individual users of Microsoft operating systems, gave the news
 a cautious welcome. "The usual problem with open source is that you
 need to be a 'techie', or have a 'techie' around to access it. But this is
 good news and a step in the right direction," he said.
</p>
<h3 id="i85-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Scottish Cinemas Receive Funds For Audio Description.</h3>
<p> 
 Scottish moviegoers will find films more accessible following the
 launch of a fund to encourage installation of audio description
 equipment in cinemas. Cinemas in Scotland can each apply for up to
 5,000 pounds to cover the cost of the equipment from the Cinema
 Access Equipment Investment Programme.
</p>
<p> 
 Under the programme, a total of 100,000 pounds will be distributed to
 cinemas by the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen, the national
 development agency for the country's film industry. To qualify, each
 cinema must satisfy technical requirements for the equipment to be
 installed, and invest the same amount as it claims from the fund. For
 more details, see:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/cin1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/cin1</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Scotland has 322 screens in 62 venues, according to Scottish Screen.
 "We're sending information ahout the funding to cinemas through all
 our usual communication channels," said a spokesperson. The
 initiative is also being supported by the Royal National Institute for
 Deaf People (RNID) Scotland, RNIB and the UK Film Council.
</p>
<p> 
 The scottish programme will be working closely with similar initiatives
 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that people with
 sensory impairments can access as wide a range of films as possible.

<p>  Sabahattin Gucukoglu from London writes in response to David Bates, who asked in the December 2006 issue about
 using a screen reader to listen to the content of websites which
 automatically and continuously play music. "It depends on your
 browser, but for Internet Explorer go to 'tools,' then 'internet options,'
 then the 'advanced' tab. From the scrolling listbox, find and uncheck
 'play sounds.'  Oh, and while you're there, turn off the downloading of

<p> 
 Steve Cutway, Information Access Specialist at Queen's University in
 Canada also responds: "Pressing the Escape key (top left corner of the
 keyboard) will usually stop sound playing on a website. I agree with
 his concerns though. When you can't see the screen and are expecting
 your screen reader to deliver information, loud, unnecessary sound is
 an unwelcome intrusion."

 that people are expected to access - great if they can copy and paste,
 but [difficult] if they have to type from a tape, especially when I have
 to say the URL in an understandable way. Here are two from a leaflet

</p>
<p> 
 "This module is currently being developed by Tribal group, and they
 have been to our University to do some initial testing with JAWS. We

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Focus- Educational Games.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Sticky By Name, Sticky By Natureby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 Audio and other accessible games for the blind have been around for
 some time and many have a loyal following. But although they could
 provide the ideal medium to engage children while learning, they are
 rarely used in the classroom.
</p>
<p> 
 Very soon that may be set to change however, with the launch of BBC
 Jam's new accessible learning materials: a set of online, fun and
 compelling games for learning National Curriculum topics, some of
 which were showcased for the first time last week at BETT, the
 world's largest conference on educational technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Sonic Science, to name one of these resources, aimed at vision
 impaired and sighted children of around seven years old, is a game
 using graphics and speech output for learning about Physics, providing
 teachers and pupils with a lesson about pressure. Using stereo sound
 and the directional keys - and peppered with puns perhaps only
 children could appreciate - the player, in the form of protagonist Harris
 Hotle must 'push' a cart by holding down the 'up' key for the correct
 amount of time before releasing to hit another cart at just the right
 speed so as not to cause a nasty accident. A talking power meter speaks
 the results to players.
</p>
<p> 
 "Usually people create resources then try to make it accessible. We're
 trying to work out something that will work for a lot more children,"
 Jonathan Hassell told delegates at BETT.
</p>
<p> 
 But this development phase hasn't always been easy, particularly as far
 as Maths and Science-themed games are concerned. "How do you
 visualise an abstract concept? That was the challenge," said Hassell.
</p>
<p> 
 One aspect of the project Hassell and his team have found particularly
 tough was creating literacy materials for vision impaired pupils he said.
 "It's different for them - they always have to have someone to give
 them feedback." Despite this daunting challenge, the team has devised
 'Benjamin's House,' named after its narrator, British poet Benjamin
 Zephaniah, which lets blind children develop Braille reading and
 writing skills as they explore Zephaniah's virtual house.
</p>
<p> 
 Using his vivid poems, he introduces us to rooms and objects in his
 home including the hoover, a spider and even well-known literary
 characters such as Dr Zeus, who happens to be in the sauna at the time.
 The whole game, which was tested among schoolchildren in Surrey,
 England, is replete with sound effects, activities and stories.
</p>
<p> 
 "We're trying to produce materials children can use on their own,"
 Hassell said, although notes for teachers and parents will be available.
 And these resources encourage learning outside of the classroom too as
 users will be able to log in from any computer and everything
 previously created can be accessed again.
</p>
<p> 
 The Jam team have received assistance on accessible gaming by the
 Bartim&#233;us Accessibility Foundation in the Netherlands where
 developers have created such games as Demor
 ( <a href="http://www.demor.nl/">http://www.demor.nl/</a>
 ) which uses Global Positioning System (GPS) and 3D sound to guide
 players around a large physical area in which the game takes place.
</p>
<p> 
 Throughout Jam's development, learners with various disabilities have
 been considered, including hearing impaired pupils who will soon have
 access to a literacy game whose animated characters use British Sign
 Language. "We can do something a lot of companies are afraid to do -
 take into account children with all kinds of needs," Hassell told
 delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 All materials will be available for free, since the entire project was
 funded by BBC licence-payers, although the downside of this is that
 materials will not be available for users beyond the UK, although
 Hassell said this could change in future. "People in other countries
 who've seen what we've done are desperate for this," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "We're re-imagining everything that happens in computer games," said
 Hassell. "We're re-inventing computer games for people that may have
 never used them before."
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: BBC Jam's accessible games for learning go live in March.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Profile- Chris Hofstader
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Software For Everyone.By Mel Poluck
</h3>
<p> 
 Before he took up the position of Vice President of Software
 Engineering at US assistive technology company Freedom Scientific,
 in between touring with his punk band the Corporate Pigs, developing
 computer software that blind people could use was just a hobby for
 Chris Hofstader.
</p>
<p> 
 Now, he has set to work on creating his own accessible software
 company as well as launching a website for blind and sighted
 programmers to share their knowledge about accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Hofstader worked at Freedom Scientific, which launched world famous
 screen reader JAWS, for 10 years, meaning he could begin to receive a
 salary for something he was passionate about. "The greatest thing for
 me was the freedom to invent my future. I was building technology
 that the next day I could use myself," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 But it wasn't always plain sailing. He said despite being just as smart
 as his colleagues, he felt significantly slowed down by using a screen
 reader. "I reached the maximum amount of activities I could do with a
 screen reader." This, compounded by the fact Hofstader began to suffer
 from serious repetitive strain injury (RSI) and worked 80-hour weeks,
 resulted in his leaving the company. "I had RSI in both hands and
 shoulders - I was bed-ridden," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 He takes important lessons from his time at the company on to his
 current ventures though. "You've always got to focus on the customer.
 Sometimes a company needs to be a vanguard and invent things before
 the customer asks for them."
</p>
<p> 
 Hofstader says assistive technology companies around the world are
 far from reaching their target audience. Considering how many blind
 people live in India, let alone the rest of the world, a disproportionate
 amount of screen readers have been sold, he said. "The assistive
 technology industry has not done its job. It's not scratched the surface
 of [the market] it hopes to attract."
</p>
<p> 
 He said the assistive technology industry's downfall is "not listening to
 science" and believes they should have much more contact with
 universities, something he is putting into practice himself through his
 own recently-launched accessible software company Ad Lib
 Technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The company's aim is to design software, and possibly hardware in
 future, based on the principles of universal design. In case things got
 too quiet, he and his team are working on developing three products.
 "We're making a GPS product as useful for pedestrians with a guide
 dog [lead] in one hand and groceries in the other as it will be for a
 woman putting on her make-up while driving." The software will be
 designed to be used on handheld devices such as Personal Digital
 Assistants (PDAs) or mobile phones.
</p>
<p> 
 Another device he is working on is a handheld barcode scanner that
 "reads" aloud product data on household items. The scanner tells the
 user what an object is, for example a CD, and any relevant data about
 it, so the songs on the track listing, for example. Similarly, it could
 read the cooking instructions on a bag of frozen peas. Hofstader
 envisages the product will be on the market for 300 to 400 dollars -
 undercutting an existing Freedom Scientific scanner by over 500
 dollars.
</p>
<p> 
 He did not want to share details of his third product under development
 with E-Access Bulletin, but he did say it is the first of its kind for the
 low-vision market.
</p>
<p> 
 Besides setting up Ad Lib Technology, Hofstader's other new
 endeavour is the website Hofstader.com
 ( <a href="http://www.hofstader.com/">http://www.hofstader.com/</a>
 ), a hub for sharing knowledge on accessible technology. For this he has
 gathered together a group of volunteer programmer friends, about half
 of whom are blind.
</p>
<p> 
 His plans for the future for the site resonate with elements of the do-it-
 yourself ethic of the Punk scene Hofstader was once part of. "I want
 the volunteers to take over and make it their thing. I'm just the catalyst
 to get things started."
</p>
<p> 
 Everything Hofstader and his team produce will be available as open
 source versions. He sums up the premise for the new company thus:
 "People at large, group buyers or people buying [software] for non
 assistive-technology purposes, they don't want to have to go to a
 website with some civil rights nonsense. We like to say we don't make
 software for blind people; we're blind people that make software for
 everyone."
