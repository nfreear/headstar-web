<h3 id="i95-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Concerns Over Government Web Accessibility Plan.</h3>
<p> 
 Technology analysts have cast doubt on the viability of draft guidelines
 for government websites that threaten to switch off '.gov.uk' web
 addresses if they failed to reach high, 'AA' levels of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The proposals, entitled 'Delivering inclusive websites: user-centred
 accessibility', have been circulated for limited consultation by the
 Central Office of Information, the Whitehall agency which assists
 public bodies with communications campaigns.
</p>
<p> 
 If approved, they would mean that existing government sites would
 have until December 2008 to meet the 'AA' standard set out in the Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) developed by the World
 Wide Web Consortium. All new sites would have to confirm
 immediately.
</p>
<p> 
 "Websites which fail to meet the mandated level of conformance shall
 be subject to the withdrawal process for .gov.uk domain names," the
 draft guidelines state.
</p>
<p> 
 The blindness charity RNIB this week broadly welcome the document,
 but said it had concerns about specific areas. Henny Swan, senior web
 accessibility consultant at RNIB, told E-Government Bulletin: "These
 concerns are around the lack of clarity when referencing versions of
 WCAG; the viability of domain removal; and the absence of detail on
 the process used to assess whether sites have met that standard. How
 will third party content such as payment systems be assessed for
 example?
</p>
<p> 
 "We would rather see further resources put in place to support web
 managers and their teams in creating and maintaining user-focused
 accessible websites, than to penalise them."
</p>
<p> 
 And Martin Greenwood, of the local government Society of IT
 Management (Socitm), said only three or four councils currently meet
 'AA' accessibility. If the COI are really serious about this it's going to
 be a tough call for many organisations."
</p>
<p> 
 Previous attempt at setting accessibility targets for public sector web
 managers have had no impact, Greenwood said. A lower, level 'A'
 target set for English council websites in 2005 as part of a set of
 'priority service outcomes' failed to achieve any greater accessibility
 levels than had been achieved in other parts of the UK, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Asked if it would be fair to remove the .gov.uk domain from public
 sector websites that failed to comply with 'AA' accessibility,
 Greenwood said: "It would be fair if they were an isolated case of non-
 compliance, and everybody else was complying, but it won't be an
 isolated case."
</p>
<h3 id="i95-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Exclusion Fears Over Digital Tv Pilot Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB has warned that blind people could be excluded from the
 digital TV revolution by the lack of a 'talking menu' option on the
 subsidised set-top boxes provided to older people and people with
 disabilities, as part of this month's digital TV switchover pilot scheme
 in Whitehaven, Cumbria.
</p>
<p> 
 Whitehaven residents can already only receive BBC2 with a digital
 signal, and next week all their channels will switch over. After
 assessment of the pilot, the next area to roll out will be the Borders
 region of Scotland, in late 2008, followed by the rest of the UK in
 phases.
</p>
<p> 
 Under a 'help scheme' funded by the Department for Culture Media
 and Sport with the BBC, eligible households can receive a Freeview
 set-top box with audio-description and other special access features for
 just &#194;£40, including installation and some training (see
 <a href="http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/helpscheme">http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/helpscheme</a>
 ). For an extra charge households can receive further subsidised systems
 such as a satellite TV service.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately around 7 million UK households would qualify for support
 under the help scheme, including people aged 75 and over; people
 claiming disability living allowance; and people registered as blind or
 partially sighted. However, despite the scheme's equipment including
 features such as a user-friendly remote control and compatibility with
 audio description of programmes, the electronic programme guides do
 not 'speak'.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is our main concern," RNIB Media and Culture Department
 Manager Leen Petr&#195;© told E-Access Bulletin this week. "Once that help
 scheme person is out of the door, how will blind people know what
 channel they are on?"
</p>
<p> 
 A joint government and BBC emerging technologies committee will
 review the findings of the pilot in February and make a
 recommendation about changes to the set-top boxes, including
 speaking menu options, Petr&#195;© said. A decision would then have to be
 taken on inclusion of any new features; and also on how these would
 be funded, whether by the help scheme partners or by TV users. "We
 would hope it doesn't affect the price which users have to pay," Petr&#195;©
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Last month the charity Age Concern welcomed the help scheme, but
 said their own research had shown that many older people in
 Whitehaven had not been ready for the change. "The experience of
 Whitehaven residents signals that such support needs to be given
 earlier," the charity said.
</p>
<h3 id="i95-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Nz Student Exposes Inaccessibility Of Government Sites.</h3>
<p> 
 A New Zealand university student has won a research award for
 exposing the accessibility shortcomings of government websites, in
 work that could have widespread application elsewhere in the world.
</p>
<p> 
 Ben Bradshaw, a fourth-year IT student at Victoria University of
 Wellington, won the 1,000 NZ Dollars first prize in the NZ Computer
 Society's annual student research contest. Bradshaw used a panel of
 testers with impaired vision alongside the open source automated
 testing program 'OpenWolf' (
 <a href="http://openwolf.sf.net/">http://openwolf.sf.net/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 According to a report on the website Computerworld, Bradshaw found
 a failure of sites to indicate in advance what type of document the user
 is accessing through a link, causing potential confusion for blind
 readers using assistive technology (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/nz2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/nz2</a>
 ).</p>

<p>  Jeff Seager, Communications Specialist at the West Virginia Division of Rehabilitation Services in the US and a
 long-time reader of our newsletter, writes in with a tip about the
 accessibility of one brand of Linux operating system.
</p>
<p> 
 He says: "I do some web design and accessibility testing for our
 website and others. At home, I've installed Ubuntu Linux on a couple
 of computers. I've been happy with the results for several years, so on
 Thursday (Oct. 18) I opted to upgrade to the latest Ubuntu release 7.10.
 Yesterday I had a little time to examine some of the changes, and was
 pleased to see that the Orca screen reader was installed by default.
</p>
<p> 
 "I tried it, and found it functions very well for me on a Dell Optiplex
 GX-150. This is by no means a high-end computer. I thought you
 might want to pass this along to your readers. It's nice to know that you
 can get good accessibility to many useful applications in a stable and
 free operating system. Until now, I don't think that's been true. Perhaps
 this will help to level the playing field for people with disabilities."

<p>  Gustaw Kon, a reader living in Germany, writes to comment with some scepticism on last issue's
 report on the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities,
 which focuses on access to technology and is due to be passed into law
 by more than 100 signatory governments.
</p>
<p> 
 "Yet again government produces vapourware," he writes. "Standards
 are adopted to ensure accessibility of government sites. My guess is
 that these are probably imports from abroad. But as section three of the
 latest bulletin rather wordily pointed out, standards are useless if they
 are not implemented.
</p>
<p> 
 "Smoke and mirrors, a nod to the variously impaired, a jewel in the
 crown of politicians headed to whatever future awaits them, are no
 substitute for producing the goods. I loathe the political window-
 dressing which masquerades as interest in or concern for various
 disabled groups."

<p>  Our reader Norman Waddington writes in to let us know about problems he has had in obtaining accessible formats for
 applying for a job online with a local authority.
</p>
<p> 
 "I have just done battle with Leeds City Council. I have applied for a
 job with them but had great difficulty with regard to accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 "I asked them to send me the necessary documentation on Word format
 so I could access it. I was promptly sent two pdf files and a document
 supposedly in Word. This was not at all accessible. I informed them it
 was no good and asked them to try again. They sent three more
 attempts which were equally useless.
</p>
<p> 
 "It is as if they have no idea of the basics of accessibility for the
 visually impaired. I did explain to the gentleman at Leeds in their
 Human Resources Department that pdf files are no good to people
 using speech software and he [had] no idea whatsoever.
</p>
<p> 
 "The gentleman at the council at Leeds was extremely apologetic. He
 did speak to their Communications Department who informed him that
 they had created a Word document. I suspect they had just changed the
 file name to '.doc' and had not changed the text in the document. He
 had no knowledge that there are many ways to create pdf files.
</p>
<p> 
 "In my experience I have only had problems with regard to web forms
 with councils. Any organisations particularly in the visually impaired
 sector are far more organised. I know nothing is perfect or ever will

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Interview- T.V. Raman, Research Scientist, Google.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Cracking The Code Of Accessible Searchby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 It was revealed this month that Google has become the fifth biggest
 company in the US, bigger even than McDonalds and Disney: a
 reflection of the fact that the way we search the internet has become
 one of the most important parts of our lives.
</p>
<p> 
 As no-one with a disability or who works with or is close to someone
 with a disability needs reminding, the desires and needs of people with
 disabilities are precisely the same as those of everybody else, which
 means that searching the internet is high on their list, too.
</p>
<p> 
 Google was always a highly usable site, one of the secrets of its
 success: simple and functional and text-based, which means it is fairly
 accessible already to people navigating the internet using text-to-
 speech converters or other special access technologies. But in recent
 years the company has realised that it is not just access to the search
 interface, but browsing the results; and even the accessibility of the
 sites returned as results that dictates how accessible the whole search
 experience has become.
</p>
<p> 
 The man charged with looking at these issues for Google is research
 scientist T.V. Raman. Based at Google HQ in Mountain View,
 California, Raman is responsible for developing Google Accessible
 Search (
 <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">http://labs.google.com/accessible/</a>
 ), a trial version of the Google search interface that is designed to be
 easier to use by people with impaired vision or other disabilities,
 including a system of ranking search results according to the
 accessibility of the site.
</p>
<p> 
 "My job is to look at what Google technology can do for users with
 disabilities: to make sure it works with assistive technology, and also
 to look at what we can build to help in new ways," he told E-Access
 Bulletin in an exclusive interview recorded during a UK trip last
 month.
</p>
<p> 
 "Search is very useful for people with impaired vision, but one of the
 things I had observed over the years is that websites returned on the
 third, fourth or fifth page of results were often the most easy to read.
</p>
<p> 
 "I built accessible search last year to address this. It is not a different
 one: it is Google, the same index, the same magic. But it swaps the
 order of search results depending on whether they are easy to read."
</p>
<p> 
 To make this assessment, the software looks at a group of 'design
 patterns' such as whether the HTML code is clearly structured;
 whether the page makes sense with images turned off; how the page
 uses colour; and whether the page can be used without a mouse.
</p>
<p> 
 "It looks at a whole bunch of things, some positive, some negative.
 And it gets trained: using user feedback on the results, it is trained to
 learn over time about which sites are the most useful."
</p>
<p> 
 The accessible search tool is still in development, though it is publicly
 available through the Google testbed area 'labs.google.com'. While
 still primarily marketed by word of mouth, the ultimate goal is to make
 it a choice on the main Google home page, T.V. said.
</p>
<p> 
 As befits a multi-billion pound technology company, these days
 Google's activities extend far beyond its initial core offering of an
 internet search engine, and T.V.'s work also includes looking at the
 wider range of Google's work such as web-based software and desktop
 tools to try to ensure that these, too, are as accessible as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 "I am looking at the whole range of Google products that have rich
 value to people with impaired vision. Blind users for example want
 simple ways to add events to a calendar." To help people gain access,
 Google has released the source code to its API (application
 programming interface)", he said, "and we are also looking for how we
 can make highly interactive web applications work better with assistive
 technologies."
</p>
<p> 
 T.V.'s background is an unusual one for a Silicon Valley high flyer.
 His initials are a clue: they stand for Tiruvilwamalai Venkatraman,
 being respectively his ancestral village and his father's name, as is the
 tradition in Southern India, where he was born, in 1965. Blind since
 childhood, he had a tough fight on his hands in a society where the
 barriers to achievement for people with disabilities are far higher than
 in many more developed countries in the West - barriers of both cost
 and social attitude.
</p>
<p> 
 Nevertheless he managed to shine as a student with particular gifts in
 maths, obtaining a place at the Indian Institute of Technology in
 Bombay. From there he successfully applied for a place at Cornell
 University, an Ivy League institution among the best colleges in
 America, travelling there in 1989 to take a PhD in mathematics.
</p>
<p> 
 "Taking exams like the GRE [graduate record examination, a test
 required by many US educational institutions] in the 1980s with the
 help of a writer was 'interesting' in India - there was a communication
 gap between [the non-profit educational testing service] ETS in the US
 that administers the tests (and is well-set up for handling students with
 special needs) and their counterparts in India who run the tests on
 behalf of ETS," said T.V. "But things got sorted out eventually."
</p>
<p> 
 He completed his thesis in 1994, gaining an Association of Computing
 Machinery Doctoral Dissertation Award in the process.
</p>
<p> 
 But although his doctorate was in maths, by the time he had completed,
 an interesting metamorphosis had taken place. "I was a mathematician,
 but I built all the computer systems to access what I needed, and by the
 time I had finished I was a computer scientist, not a mathematician any
 more."
</p>
<p> 
 Following his graduation, one of his best known projects has been the
 invention and continued development of Emacspeak, a speech interface
 to the complete PC desktop including web and email access (the name
 is derived from the term 'Emacs', a powerful type of text editor and
 interface often used by computer programmers).
</p>
<p> 
 His subsequent path to Google was a highly successful career in
 programming and systems development followed at some of the
 world's biggest names in innovation including Xerox, Digital
 Equipment Corporation, Adobe Systems and IBM Research.
</p>
<p> 
 At IBM he worked on developing a speech interface for mobile web
 applications such as online shopping. The solution was developed as a
 mainstream application, he says, though it would be useful for blind
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite his switch to IT, his heart has remained with maths: his
 favourite pastime is solving puzzles which require an intuitive feel for
 numbers and mathematical patterns. He can solve a Braille version of
 the Rubik's Cube, for example, in just 30 seconds (for a video of this
 remarkable feat, see:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rubik1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rubik1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 And so to Google in August 2005, where he has become one of the key
 modern players in access to information by people with impaired
 vision. If anyone can solve the puzzle of full accessibility, it is surely
 T.V. Raman.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Technology- Access to 'Web 2.0'.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Frustration 2.0?By Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 Is the phenomenon of 'Web 2.0' - websites where users can share their
 own content, such as social network Facebook or video-sharing site
 YouTube - destined to create a whole bleak new world of information
 that is inaccessible to people with disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 Such was the depressing question posed by Kath Moonan, Senior
 Accessibility and Usability Consultant at computer access charity
 AbilityNet, to delegates at last month's Techshare 2007 conference
 hosted by the RNIB and other disability charities in London (
 <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare">http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "Web 2.0 describes a move from static, content-driven sites to
 collaborative sites. They are more like a desktop application might
 work," Moonan said.
</p>
<p> 
 Not only are such sites gaining in popularity and in their range of uses,
 Moonan said, but increasingly they are also linking up together into
 one huge 'ecosystem' of sites. For example, you can easily link to a
 video on YouTube from your page in the music sharing and social
 networking site MySpace.
</p>
<p> 
 But unless accessibility is taken seriously by the makers of these sites,
 entire categories of web user could end up being excluded from this
 interdependent world, Moonan said. "One of the problems is we're in
 danger of creating a whole inaccessible ecosystem because the major
 players don't take accessibility seriously," she said. "And if the big
 ones don't do it, nobody bothers. So if you're building for example a
 Facebook application [a small software tool that any develop can build
 to add extra functions tot he social network], and Facebook doesn't
 require any accessibility from you, you say why should I? It builds a
 culture of complacency."
</p>
<p> 
 All this is doubly galling because, just as the original information-
 based web opened up new possibilities for people with disabilities in
 accessing information independently, so online social networking has
 the potential to allow new types of social interaction to take place
 between people with disabilities and everybody else. But only if the
 systems are accessible to all, Moonan said.
</p>
<p> 
 She illustrated Web 2.0's potential by playing a video interview with
 Damon Rose, editor of the BBC disability magazine website 'Ouch'.
 Rose, who is blind, said that tools like Facebook could be extremely
 useful for networking with people you might come across at a business
 conference, because if you are blind, it might be hard to pick them out
 when you are at the conference itself, for example if you have just
 heard somebody give a talk that you liked, but you can't see where
 they are. With Facebook, you can network afterwards without physical
 mobility being an issue.
</p>
<p> 
 Other examples of useful Web 2.0 content include videos on the young
 people's online network Bebo with British Sign Language content,
 Moonan said.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet is carrying out an online survey of web users with
 disabilities to assess their experiences of Web 2.0, she said. "We are
 keeping it going because so far we have had a small number of
 respondents. But a lot of people have emailed us and said 'Hi, I'm glad
 you're doing a survey, but I can't access any of the Web 2.0 sites to
 answer the questions. Can you let me know when they are accessible
 and I can go and find out about them?" said Moonan. "Does this sound
 familiar from Web 1.0?"
</p>
<p> 
 So what are the features of Web 2.0 sites that present the biggest
 access problems for people using screen-readers or other special access
 technologies?
</p>
<p> 
 Perhaps the biggest single problem is caused by 'captcha' tools,
 Moonan said. These are graphical panels displaying a visually distorted
 sequence of letters or numbers that people must enter to proceed. The
 tests are designed to weed out the automated 'spambot' programmes
 that try to take over interactive websites for advertising, and which
 cannot recognise visually distorted characters; but they have the side-
 effect of also excluding people using non-visual ways of accessing the
 web.
</p>
<p> 
 "Captcha tools can be incredibly difficult if you have low vision or
 dyslexia, and they shut out blind users altogether," Moonan said. On
 one site we saw, you can't even contact customer support because of a
 captcha file.
</p>
<p> 
 Another problem with many of the new Web 2.0 sites is that, in the
 rush to break new ground and be the first to innovate, developers often
 put incomplete or test versions of a site up before they fully ready, and
 look to iron out any problems such as accessibility problems in future
 phases or 'iterations', she said.
</p>
<p> 
 "They say we'll put it up broken and fix it later. And so you end up
 with sites like MySpace - 'table soup' for screen-reader users. Has
 Web 2.0 created a culture of inaccessibility as in the early days of the
 web, from which we are still picking up the pieces? Are we developing
 a new generation of cowboy developers?"
</p>
<p> 
 If the answers to such questions are to be positive, there are a number
 of basic steps all developers must start to take, Moonan said. These
 include that:
</p>
<p> 
 - All captcha graphics should have an audio alternative;
</p>
<p> 
 - In the longer term, non-visual alternatives to captcha must be used
 such as email verification or mobile phone verification;
</p>
<p> 
 - Help pages and navigational signposting throughout the site should
 be developed and improved;
</p>
<p> 
 - If multimedia is used, it should be easy to turn audio and video feeds
 on and off;
</p>
<p> 
 - There should always be alternative ways of interacting with the same
 information.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately the goal is equality of access, Moonan said - whatever the
 sites are used for. "One description of social networking sites is sites
 that allow people to waste time at work. And because I believe in
 equality, I believe everyone should be able to waste time at work."
