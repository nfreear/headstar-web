 Section One: News.
</p>
<h3 id="i88-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Home Computer Assessments Triumph In Ewell-Being Awards.</h3>
<p> 
 A remote home computer assessment service from UK computing
 charity for disabled people, AbilityNet, has won a prestigious annual
 award recognising excellence and innovation in the use of information
 and communication technologies (ICTs).
</p>
<p> 
 The eWell-Being awards
 ( <a href="http://www.sustainit.org/ewell-being-awards/index.php">http://www.sustainit.org/ewell-being-awards/index.php</a>
 ), supported by E-Access Bulletin sister publication E-Government
 Bulletin, celebrate the social, economic and environmental benefits of
 ICT. They are hosted by SustainIT, a sub-group of the charity UK
 Centre for Economic and Environmental Development (UK CEED).
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet's remote assessment
 ( www.abilitynet.org.uk/athome_remote )
 won the 'Age and disability' category, one of nine award categories.
 Using Voice Over IP Telephony (VoIP), instant messaging and
 webcams, an assessor remotely evaluates the computing needs of users
 to best suit their requirements in their own home. So far around 500
 people have used the low cost service.
</p>
<p> 
 "Its strength is reaching out to disabled people and responding to their
 needs in a flexible way," AbilityNet Head of Operations David Banes
 told E-Access Bulletin. "It also has potential for opening up
 employment to disabled people and assessments are shorter and
 sharper." Previously, AbilityNet assessed disabled computer users
 from the charity's offices.
</p>
<p> 
 The BlueIRIS project from Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Society for the
 Blind in the UK and the Usability Exchange were commended in the
 same 'Age and disability' category.
</p>
<p> 
 BlueIRIS provides audio news, information and entertainment over the
 internet created exclusively for vision impaired people using its own
 software. Over 1,200 pieces of original content have been produced
 and a national roll-out is planned.
</p>
<p> 
 The Usability Exchange employs a range of disabled people to test the
 websites of organisations and companies as well as providing a
 platform to identify and resolve accessibility problems and help them
 understand the experiences of disabled web users.
</p>
<h3 id="i88-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Un Launches Campaign For Inclusive Technology.</h3>
<p> 
 The Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication
 Technology, an international campaign to widen access to digital
 technologies, has been launched by the United Nations. It aims to
 encourage technology vendors to build accessibility into mass-market
 products by promoting worldwide adoption of new standards,
 regulations and legislation.
</p>
<p> 
 Launched at the UN's New York headquarters in March 2007, the
 Global Initiative
 ( <a href="http://www.g3ict.com/index.htm">http://www.g3ict.com/index.htm</a>
 ) aims to remove the need for people with disabilities to buy assistive
 products that are often expensive and difficult to maintain. In this it
 supports Article 9 of the recently unveiled Convention on the Rights of
 Persons with Disabilities, which requires governments to ensure that
 "technologies and systems become accessible at minimum cost." For
 more, see: <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/unaccess2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/unaccess2</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Hendrietta Ipeleng Bogopane-Zulu, a vision impaired politician from
 South Africa, told the UN that a screen reader is essential for her work
 as a member of parliament. "I use [the Freedom Scientific Screen
 reader] 'Jaws'. But it's very expensive because it's dollar-based. When
 converted to [South Africa's currency] the rand, it becomes
 unaffordable for most people," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The main challenge is to strike a balance between changing industry
 practices while enabling global markets in accessible products to
 develop, which will help to drive down costs, said Axel Leblois,
 executive director of the Global Initiative. "Legislation and regulation
 can do a lot of good, but they can also fragment markets," he told the
 meeting.
</p>
<p> 
 In March 2008 the Global Initiative will meet in Geneva to hear
 commitments from industry and international organizations to pursue
 specific standardization efforts. Regional meetings will be held in
 Turkey, Brazil, South Africa, and India, before the campaign draws to
 a close in March 2009.
</p>
<h3 id="i88-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: 'Talking Lampposts' Hit The Streets Of Portsmouth.</h3>
<p> 
 A public outdoor navigation aid has gone live in Portsmouth city centre
 in the UK that "speaks" locations live to vision impaired pedestrians.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'talking lampposts' from REACT, provide an audible confirmation
 of their location when activated by an electronic fob carried by the
 pedestrian. This "audible signposting" is emitted from a small box
 attached to nine lampposts located in the city's retail centre using radio
 frequencies.
</p>
<p> 
 Users hear audible messages such as "you are now at the junction of
 Arundel Street and Slindon Street, access to Post Office." Users
 purchase the activating fob for 30 pounds or pay a five pound
 returnable deposit for daily use, available from council mobility charity
 Shopmobility and from the Portsmouth Association for the Blind. "It
 gives reassurance. It allows more independence," Portsmouth City
 Council City Centre Manager Barry Walker told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The fobs will also activate REACT boxes located in Leeds where a
 similar initiative has been rolled out.
 The Portsmouth scheme was funded with 35,000 pounds from
 Portsmouth City Council, the Single Regeneration Budget and private
 companies. The REACT system was developed in conjunction with the
 Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB).
</p>
<h3 id="i88-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: New Browser Aims To Make Video Accessible.</h3>
<p> 
 Technology giant IBM aims to launch a new web browser providing
 vision impaired users with new levels of control over multimedia
 content by the end of 2007.
</p>
<p> 
 The browser will enable users to adjust and navigate through audio
 output from streamed video content using keyboard shortcuts.
</p>
<p> 
 Developed by vision impaired employee Dr Chieko Asakawa at IBM's
 research laboratory in Tokyo, the browser includes pre-defined
 shortcuts that enable users to start and stop video files, adjust the
 volume and playback speed of audio output, and choose whether to
 listen to the video soundtrack, output from a screen reader, or an audio
 description track if it is present.
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/abrowser">http://fastlink.headstar.com/abrowser</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The browser aims to solve two main problems vision impaired people
 experience with online video content: playback is usually controlled
 with buttons, and files often launch automatically when a web page is
 opened. At present, the so-called 'A-Browser' has been developed to
 work with the Windows Media Player and Adobe Flash content, but it
 is not yet clear how many of the numerous other multimedia formats it
 will be compatible with.

<p> 
 So just what is a decorative image? It seems to me that one person's
 eye candy is another person's emotional link to a website. For some,
 decorative images are those horizontal rules, bullets and other forms of
 minor 'clip art' we find sprinkled around the web. For others, the term
 is wider ranging. It includes more content rich images such as photos
 and artwork.
 So, you might ask, what's the problem with this varied point of view?
 The answer is simple: alt texts.
 If you Google for the term "decorative image + alt texts", you'll come
 across countless sites that suggest that a decorative image be given a
 'null alt text.' It's possible that we can all agree that for minor forms of
 clipart, a null alt text will do nicely. But it gets a little more difficult
 when it comes to more complex images.
 I'm not talking about diagrams, blueprints or other information rich
 images. There's no argument that they should always carry an alt text,
 possibly even a long description. I mean the vibrant, emotion rich
 images that provide a website with a sense of atmosphere.
 It's sometimes argued that providing such images with descriptive alt
 texts provides too much "noise" for a screen reader user. If we screen
 reader users stopped to listen to every alt text, every time we came
 across an image, then this assumption would probably be right. But I'll
 let you into a secret: we won't.
 Like sighted users, we'll skip around the content of the page until we
 find something that interests us. If the first few syllables of an alt text
 sound promising, we'll pause to read. If they don't, we'll move on to
 the next element on the page. Also like sighted users, we're often
 likely to pause on something unimportant, but which captures our
 imagination.
 A good alt text can conjure up wonderfully stimulating mental images.
 A friendly smile is the same in print, photo or wax crayon. Whether
 you listen to an image or see it, the emotional response is the key
 factor, so why should we recommend that these emotion rich images
 should be given a null alt text and hidden from screen reader users?
 Perhaps it's time we introduced another group of images: 'emotion rich
 images' and encouraged the practice of providing descriptive alt texts
 for them. If people don't want to listen to the alt text, they won't. If
 people don't want to pause and look at the image, they won't. In either
 case, it's good to have the choice.
 What would they sound like? For me, they would describe the content
 of the picture to the extent I could understand the reason it had been
 put there. [Web consultancy] Nomensa's Christmas card last year, sent
 out digitally, contained a picture of a little girl standing in the middle
 of a snow covered glade, surrounded by fir trees. She had her arms
 flung out sideways and her face lifted to the falling snow. The strapline
 was "experience is everything".
 I could picture that scene perfectly. Even if I'd never seen fir trees or
 had no idea what different colours really looked like, I could still
 conjur up the feeling of snow falling, the bracing air, feeling good,
 feeling happy, feeling alive.
 People get worried about alt texts, but they're just the same as
 describing a picture to a friend on the phone. You use language that
 describes the moment captured in the image, that's all.
 - Response by Patrick H. Lauke:
 In many situations, 'fluff' images, I'm particularly thinking of those
 stock photography monstrosities like 'businessmen shaking hands,' are
 only there to give a visual representation of the tone of voice that
 should already be present in a page's copy. In those situations, I would
 strongly argue that, even without descriptive alt text, the mental images
 would be conjured up by the tone of voice of the body copy itself.
 As ever, it's impossible to generalise rules for alt [tagging]. It all
 depends on context, and on whether or not the same meaning and the
 more ephemeral "feel" are maintained.
 - Response by Leonie Watson:
 Patrick's right, in as much as it's difficult to create general rules for
 this, but I'm not sure I place so much faith in the linguistic capability
 of body copy. If every web page were littered with evocative phrases
 such as "stock photography monstrosities", then things might be
 different. The catch is that a phrase like that is only evocative because I
 know exactly what he means when he writes it.
 Perhaps this is the rub. Not every visually impaired person was born
 that way. I could see perfectly until my mid 20s, so I know what
 Patrick means by "stock photography monstrosities." Someone who
 had never seen at all would have less understanding, but the
 description "business men shaking hands" still conveys something to
 everyone.
 That's the key factor, one person's monstrosity is another person's Van
 Gogh. The choice should be theirs, not the developer's. Of course,
 stock photography is something I personally don't miss in the least.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Focus- Geographical Information Systems.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Online Mapping For Everyoneby Christopher J. Andrews.
The Geographical Information Systems (Gis) Profession Has Always
Maintained A Community-Focused Perspective That Pervades Both The
Development And Use Of Geospatial Technology. That Perspective
Undoubtedly Grows Out Of The Fact That Working With Map Data Leads To
The Realisation That The World Is Fundamentally Finite And Has Few
Insurmountable Barriers.
Geospatial Technologists Currently Find Themselves In The Whirlwind Of
Web 2.0 Technology, Which Has Popularized Web-Based Gis In A
Manner That Threatens To Wrest The Concept Of The Gis Developer Away
From The Gis Community. The Gis Establishment Has The Responsibility
To Bring Its Heightened Level Of Community Awareness To These New
Technologies And Applications Of Gis.
An Area That Has Been Underrepresented In Gis Technology But Which
Addresses Fundamental Characteristics Of Gis Data Openness And
Sharing Is Making Web-Based Gis Tools More Accessible To Visually
Impaired And Blind Users.
</h3>
<p> 
 Many writers have described the internet as a levelling technology that
 improves access to information for everyone. The reality is that the
 internet offers a variety of technologies for information sharing, some
 of which are accessible to anyone who can read text and some which
 are not as accessible. Companies are rapidly adopting web
 development techniques such as Adobe Flash, graphic design and
 [programming language] JavaScript to enhance the user's experience.
 Unfortunately, poorly designed Flash animations, images with no
 descriptive, alternative ('alt') text, and JavaScript-masked hyperlinks
 (anchors in a Web page that use JavaScript to redirect the page instead
 of simpler html) will impede the ability of blind users to access
 internet-based information. Also, poor colour choices and fixed text
 sizes may render websites useless for colourblind or moderately
 visually impaired users.
</p>
<p> 
 The population of web users with some sort of visual impairment may
 be larger than you realise. It's safe to say that at least 5.5 per cent of
 the
 web-surfing population is colourblind (based on a calculation of the
 proportion of the general public that is colourblind -
 <a href="http://waynesword.palomar.edu/colorbl1.htm">http://waynesword.palomar.edu/colorbl1.htm</a>
 . Male-to-female internet usage ratios actually suggest that the number
 may be closer to 7 per cent or 8 per cent in the US). According to the
 American Foundation for the Blind, approximately 1.5 million
 American computer users are blind or visually impaired (see:
 <a href="http://www.afb.org/Section.asp?SectionID=15#num">http://www.afb.org/Section.asp?SectionID=15#num</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Furthermore, consider anecdotal evidence such as this: during a casual
 conversation, a friend of mine mentioned that the CEOs of her two
 former companies both needed to adjust web browser fonts to the
 maximum size to read web pages. Some of the current web technology
 trends include [programming tools] Ajax, user interface tools that
 heavily employ JavaScript, complex style sheets that use fixed font
 sizes and even mapping applications with built-in Flash and other less
 accessible technologies. Because of these trends, a gap has developed
 that threatens to make web-based GIS and non-GIS applications less
 accessible to the blind and visually impaired.
</p>
<p> 
 There are compelling legal reasons for GIS developers to build web-
 based mapping applications that provide access to the range of visually
 impaired and blind web surfers. Numerous localities including the UK,
 the US and many individual states have legislation that has been
 interpreted by their respective courts to require that websites used by
 government employees or served by the government to the general
 public must be accessible to internet users with visual disabilities.
</p>

 Once the need for creating accessible GIS websites is recognised, the
 next step will be to figure out how to evaluate a website for
 accessibility. For legally blind web surfers, a website needs to be
 "readable," in that an assistive technology application is used to speak
 aloud all of the readable text on a page with some context information
 to support navigation. A combination of straightforward html element
 use and nuanced page layout combine to facilitate website readability
 for such users. Additional techniques improve readability for
 colourblind and visually impaired users.

 Although many projects may not budget the time for accessibility
 development and the expense of acquiring text to speech software for
 web browsing, the Lynx text-based Web browser
 ( <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">http://lynx.browser.org/</a>
 ) can show the sighted user a rough idea of the website text that will be
 read to a blind user. While not used heavily by the blind or visually
 impaired community, the Lynx browser is free and offers sighted users
 some insight as to how informative and navigable the text information
 in a web page may be. Be aware that some page reading software will
 process JavaScript and Flash, so Lynx is not a complete representation
 of how a website reads to a blind surfer.
 Once the GIS developer has digested all the tools to assess website
 accessibility, the realisation strikes home that ultimately GIS has one
 simple problem. The most popular representation for GIS data on the
 internet is an image. Is it even possible to make an image more
 accessible to blind or visually impaired users? In fact, there are many
 techniques available to GIS developers to make map applications
 compliant with accessibility laws and standards.

 New technologies, such as the recently introduced Google KML search
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/kml1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/kml1</a>
 ) may also open up the interaction between the web and the real world
 for the blind mapping enthusiast. Future web mapping applications and
 GPS sharing sites might keep in mind the use of technologies such as
 voice- and GPS-enabled personal digital assistants (PDAs) and touch
 tablet technology that open up geospatial data collection and analysis
 to the blind.
 The GIS industry has long recognized the levelling ability of mapping
 data and technology. The industry must ensure that its traditional
 community-based ethics perpetuate, even as inevitable changes in
 technologies and applications take GIS in new directions. Ensuring and
 enhancing accessibility to web mapping applications for blind and
 visually impaired web users seem like the obvious place to start.
