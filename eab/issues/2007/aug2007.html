<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i92-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: International Trials For Groundbreaking Scanner.</h3>
<p> 
 A device is under development that combines a scanner and labeller
 with voice output, radio, mp3 player, talking clock, voice recorder and
 audio book player, for the first time in a single unit.
</p>
<p> 
 The TellMate, from Singapore company GaiShan Technology, can
 read Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips embedded in labels
 on household objects, such as tins of food and clothes. The device can
 scan these reusable "tagged" labels and "speak" the information stored
 on them aloud, once the user has pre-recorded the name of the item and
 any additional information about it, such as sell-by date. Tell Mate is
 sold with 20 reusable iron-on and adhesive-backed RFID tags.
</p>
<p> 
 The device is about the same size and dimensions as a thick remote
 control and has five main keys for navigating the features menu and
 buttons on the sides for voice recording, locking the keypad and power.
 Voice activated buttons tell users which button he or she has pressed.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's simple to use. The buttons are big enough but not bulky," said
 Dave Chatten-Smith, founder of the non-profit Hampshire blindness
 organisation Blink
 ( <a href="http://www.blinkfundraising.co.uk/">http://www.blinkfundraising.co.uk/</a>
 ) and current UK supplier of the device.
 "The voice commands are not professionally custom recorded voices,
 but it's a very good unit: it's small, compact; light and it has a good
 neck strap so you're not going to lose it," Chatten-Smith told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Chin Swee Jeen, of GaiShan Technology
 ( <a href="http://www.gaishantech.com/">http://www.gaishantech.com/</a>
 ) told E-Access Bulletin that 100 units have been sold globally.
 Participants from trials conducted with 50 vision impaired people in
 Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore and 10 in the US have said they
 prefer to have multiple functions in one gadget. "In this part of the
 world, new technology requires you to have a new mindset. The
 difference in accessing information [using] RFID is great. They are so
 used to having Braille or nothing at all," said Chin.
</p>
<p> 
 The device costs 250 pounds and is available from Chatten-Smith who,
 although the current UK distributor of the device, is looking for a
 permanent UK stockist. He found out about TellMate on an assistive
 technology news website and contacted the company to ask if he could
 test and distribute it for Singapore-based manufacturer GaiShan
 Technology.
 The second version, which is to have a built-in slot for a removable
 Secure Digital flash memory card format, will be released by winter
 2007.

<h3 id="i92-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Campaign For Accessible Mobile Phones Launched In Us.</h3>
<p> 
 A campaign has been launched to support vision impaired Americans
 who have problems accessing mobile phone services. The campaign,
 co-ordinated by the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB), will
 raise awareness of Section 255, a part of the Federal Communications
 Act that requires all phones to be made usable by people with
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Cell Phone Accessibility Project' provides consumers with
 information about Section 255; what consumers can expect from a
 usable cell phone; information about available cell phones with
 features that make them more usable by people with vision loss; and
 strategies that consumers can use in campaigning for phones that meet
 their needs. The AFB also provides information about how to file a
 complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
 which enforces Section 255
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/afbmobile">http://fastlink.headstar.com/afbmobile</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "Two kinds of complaints can be filed under Section 255, formal and
 informal. The complaints are informal. The FCC notifies the
 companies against whom the complaints are filed and the companies
 are required to contact the consumers to attempt to resolve the
 accessibility issues," said Paul W. Schroeder, AFB Vice President,
 Programs and Policy. "We decided to assist a group of individuals in
 filing a series of complaints to provide evidence to the FCC that the
 cell phone industry, as a whole has not made enough progress in
 developing accessible cell phones," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "Hopefully, companies will do two things: provide more details about
 the accessibility features currently available in phones, and begin
 working with qualified experts to fully examine accessibility and
 improve everything from visibility of the display to the tactile
 identification of keys and speech output for all phone functions and
 information," Schroeder said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Thus far, 14 individuals have filed complaints against the cell phone
 service provider Sprint Nextel and against several phone
 manufacturers," said Schroeder. "I expect that there may be a few more
 complaints that will be filed in the next few weeks as we have a
 number of individuals who have expressed an interest in making
 complaints," he said. "Section 255 requires both service providers and
 manufacturers to ensure that their services and equipment are
 accessible to people with disabilities, if readily achievable. That is why
 the complaints are against both the provider and the specific phone
 manufacturer," he explained.

<h3 id="i92-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Audio Description Included As Standard For Sony Tvs.</h3>
<p> 
 Sony has begun shipping its Bravia range of integrated digital TVs
 with audio description included as a standard function. The first of the
 new Bravia models were launched in June, and the company aims to
 equip the entire Bravia range with audio description by the end of
 September 2007.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this year rival TV manufacturer Panasonic made a similar
 move, enabling consumers to access audio described broadcast content
 without buying extra equipment such as a set-top box. At present, the
 audio description facilities provided by both Sony and Panasonic are
 restricted to programme content only, and so do not include an
 accessible electronic programme guide.
</p>
<p> 
 The move was welcomed by the RNIB. However, Jill Whitehead,
 RNIB Media and Culture Information Officer said that Sony could
 improve the accessibility of its remote control handset. "The Panasonic
 remote control is much better," she told E-Access Bulletin. Unlike
 Sony, the Panasonic system enables users to isolate the audio
 description stream, listening to it privately through headphones, which
 may be a bonus for households with sighted and vision impaired
 viewers.
</p>
<p> 
 Although Sony's move is a welcome development, Whitehead was
 cautious about the impact on other manufacturers. "Audio description
 is still not seen as a desirable feature for the mass market. The
 manufacturers think of it as serving a minority audience," she said.
 RNIB has produced a downloadable guide to audio description that
 includes more details about the new Sony and Panasonic models:

<p>  Simon Pavitt, Director of Headware writes in response to queries from David Rosser of the Torbay Care Trust
 about being unable to access the PARIS Content Management System
 (CMS) in the last issue of the bulletin: "If you're looking for an
 accessible CMS a good starting point might be:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/cmsacc">http://fastlink.headstar.com/cmsacc</a>
 ," writes Simon.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'd be disinclined to go for a proprietary system as you have no
 control over how it adapts to new standards or develops new features.
 Using open source software gives you more flexibility to make
 whatever changes you need.
</p>
<p> 
 "I use Drupal, which has a user group of people working on its
 accessibility:
 <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/accessibility">http://groups.drupal.org/accessibility</a>
 . It also has the same interface for users as admin, although you have the
 choice of using different themes for each if you wish).
</p>
<p> 
 "A wide variety of open source CMS can be tried out at
 <a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com">http://www.opensourcecms.com</a>
 . It's not completely obvious, so follow the Portal (CMS) link in left
 menu, then select the CMS you are interested in and use the 'Admin
 login' link. You can then get your own idea about its accessibility or
 run any tests.
</p>
<p> 
 "Bear in mind though, that CMSs generally come with the ability to
 swap the template for another one. Drupal has hundreds that different
 people have contributed, for example. So the default one might not
 necessarily be the best one from an accessibility point of view, and a
 designer can adapt them to make them better or worse."
</p>
<p> 
 Waqas Hussain, Director of Consultancy Diversity, Equality responds
 to David Rosser's other questions about legislation relating to
 websites: "All UK websites including those of local authorities are
 covered under part three of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)
 1995, to be accessible and usable by disabled people and I believe in
 your case, Part two (employment) may also be applicable.
 Furthermore, DDA 2005 requires all public authorities to promote
 disability equality, which does include taking into account accessibility
 and usability of websites or software for disabled employees and
 service users at the time of procurement or development.
</p>
<p> 
 "You could discuss these issues with the human resources department
 or the person in the Equalities unit responsible for dealing with
 disability equality and related issues. You could also request for a copy
 of the local authority's Disability Equality Scheme (DES) in an
 accessible format and point out any actions they have committed to
 take for improving accessibility and usability. We work extensively
 with local authorities on these issues. Please feel free to contact me

<p>  Suzette Keith from the Middlesex University Design for All Research Group writes: "Did you know that 99 per cent
 of EU businesses are classed as small to medium enterprises
 employing less than 250 people and most of these are sole traders,
 family run businesses or others with less than 10 employees? There are
 now many surveys of web accessibility of government and large
 organisations, but how are the small local service companies doing?
</p>
<p> 
 "Currently I am running an exploratory project for a European
 consumer group and want to find some examples of good practice
 among small businesses in the leisure and entertainment business and
 social services. These business sectors were chosen because they
 contribute to quality of life and wellbeing, and generally the fun side of
 life!
</p>
<p> 
 "Can anyone recommend a favourite accessible web site run by a small
 local business such as a family run restaurant or pub, online shopping
 for a specialised hobby, sport or food, or maybe an aromatherapist or
 similar? I will look at the site to see how it is designed and will make
 contact with the site owner or developer with a few questions in
 September. When you make your recommendation, please give me the
 URL and also can you tell me what sort of assistive technologies or
 adjustments you use when accessing the web, or tell me if you are a

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Breaking The Circleby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 The benefits of technology and how to make them accessible to more
 people, occupies a lot of Steve Tyler's thinking. As Senior Strategic
 Manager for Digital Technology at the RNIB, Tyler is always looking
 ahead, trying to anticipate the improvements that new technology can
 bring to the lives of people with impaired vision.
</p>
<p> 
 Mobile devices have a key role in his thinking, he told E-Access
 Bulletin. "In theory mobile technology should tick all the boxes for
 blind people. It provides communication, it can help you get around,
 and can be used as a safety device," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 To bring these benefits to more vision impaired people, Tyler hopes to
 build constructive relationships with manufacturers of mobile devices.
 Recent meetings with mobile phone giant Nokia
 ( <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">http://www.nokia.com/</a>
 ) have given Tyler reason to be optimistic about this approach. "We've
 had some good sessions. The beauty of these meetings is being able to
 talk to the technical staff. We discussed some of the excellent voice
 technology that has been developed by independent suppliers, such as
 the Nuance Talks
 ( <a href="http://www.nuance.com/talks/">http://www.nuance.com/talks/</a>
 ) product for example," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 Specialist products such as this can bring huge benefits to users but
 there needs to be wider take-up, says Tyler. "Wayfinder [a GPS-
 enabled navigation system] works amazingly well with Talks," says
 Tyler. Excellent as these products undoubtedly are, too few people
 benefit from them, he says.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's no good if the technology doesn't reach the users. But it's often a
 struggle to get it out to the public because they don't know it's
 available, the cost is high, or the user needs to know some horribly
 technical information. Even when people do know about technology
 that makes their phone more accessible they have to send the phone
 away to have the technology loaded onto it. Either that or they have to
 be a computer geek themselves," says Tyler.
</p>
<p> 
 The trend towards globalised markets brings new opportunities, he
 says. In order to safeguard their position in North American and
 European markets, companies such as Nokia are having to  respond to
 the needs of ageing populations, and the public policies and research
 programmes that promote accessible design. In Europe, a research
 programmes known as COST (Cooperation Europeenne dans le
 Domaine de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) draws together
 researchers from EU and non-EU countries. One particular strand,
 'Cost 219', aims to improve access to telecommunications services for
 elderly and disabled people. For information about work on COST 219
 in the UK, see:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/cost219">http://fastlink.headstar.com/cost219</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 In the US, similar objectives are the aim of policies such as Healthy
 People 2010
 ( <a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/">http://www.healthypeople.gov/</a>
 ), a plan drafted by the US Department of Health and Human Sciences to
 improve the quality of life of ageing American citizens, and promote
 inclusion. Such policies encourage Nokia to think about how to make
 their products accessible, and organisations such as RNIB are well-
 placed to help them, says Tyler. "Their phrase is 'Connecting People'.
 They understand the potential of personal, configurable devices to
 break down barriers between people," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 Working more closely with organisations such as the RNIB will save
 Nokia valuable time otherwise spent researching what vision-impaired
 users want from mobile devices, and how they use them. Ultimately,
 the aim of the RNIB is to encourage manufacturers to build
 accessibility features into products from the start, as far as is possible,
 says Tyler. This would save the user from having to spend more time
 and money on assistive technology, but manufacturers must also be
 able to see benefits, most obviously demand from the mass market.
 "This needn't be rocket science, heads in the clouds stuff," says Tyler.
 An example of a mass market service which also brings great benefits
 to vision impaired people is the cinema listings service provided by
 network operator Orange, says Tyler.
</p>
<p> 
 "You can receive film listings and storylines for your local cinemas, in
 an accessible text format. So right there you have something that has
 mass-market appeal, but ticks boxes for blind people," he says.
 However, even when a manufacturer or service provider does
 introduce accessible options, barriers remain, says Tyler. "A few years
 ago the manufacturer LG introduced a talking microwave oven, but
 said that they couldn't sell them. I decided to do some research, and
 rang five big retailers of LG products to ask if they sold the
 microwave. None of them knew about it," says Tyler.
</p>
<p> 
 "A problem with the retail industry is that only sales are recorded.
 Failure to serve customer requirements doesn't get logged. It creates a
 circle that we must break," he says.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: A Question Of Mobilityby Dr Evangelos Bekiaris.
</h3>
<p> 
 ASK-IT is a European umbrella project aiming to develop a platform
 for information and services that will be delivered via mobile devices.
 This is large, challenging and ambitious but aims to change the market.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Ambient intelligence system of agents for knowledge-based and
 integrated services for mobility impaired users'
 ( <a href="http://www.ask-it.org/">http://www.ask-it.org/</a>
 ) is funded by 18 million euros - 10 million of which is paid by the
 European Commission (EC), the rest by over 50 partners. It is an
 initiative of the 'e-Inclusion' Strategic Objective of the IST Thematic
 Area of the 6th Framework Programme
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/einc">http://fastlink.headstar.com/einc</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The aims are to prove that full travel accessibility for anyone who has a
 problem in being autonomously mobile can be achieved in a reliable,
 seamless and viable way using a range of available technologies and
 communications networks. It also aims to enable personalised, self-
 configurable, intuitive and context related applications and services as
 well as facilitate knowledge acquisition.
</p>
<p> 
 The services offered cover transport, tourism and leisure, personal
 support services, work, business, education and community building
 related content. Users can get information; guidance; book and pay for
 any transport, tourist or other service through any mobile device, such
 as a mobile phone, PDA, in-car terminal, tablet PC or laptop; anywhere
 - indoors, outdoors, in any connected city or country.
</p>
<p> 
 It will work seamlessly, so the technologies to keep the user connected
 might change, but he or she wouldn't notice. The framework is
 interoperable in terms of what mobile device used or whether a local or
 wide area networks is used. The framework is entrusted and based on
 intuitive web-semantics; thus offering a seamless and device
 independent service everywhere.
</p>
<p> 
 And the user interface adapts to the users' interests, abilities, habits and
 intentions. Content and tools are integrated within an Ambient
 Intelligent Framework [an electronic environment that is responsive to
 mobile devices] and a self-configurable user interface that offers
 service personalisation according to user profile, habits, preferences
 and context of use.
</p>
<p> 
 The ASK-IT service and system will be tested in seven core sites and
 one satellite site across Europe, with about 50 mobility-impaired users
 in each site. The sites are: Athens-Thessaloniki, Greece; Bucharest,
 Romania; Genova, Italy; Helsiniki, Finland; Madrid, Spain; Newcastle,
 UK; Nuremberg, Germany; and a satellite site in The Hague,
 Netherlands.
</p>
<p> 
 The main development work of the project is coming to an end and the
 focus has moved towards the integration of the tools into the ASK-IT
 system environment and the test sites. The pilot sites are coming to the
 end of the accessible content gathering and web services development.
 Connection of new and existing services to ASK-IT is realised through
 an innovative tool that has been developed within the project, namely
 the Data Management module.
</p>
<p> 
 Some examples of developed user interfaces are the domotics
 application, through which the user can control different parts of the
 house in terms of lighting and heating. And at the Greek pilot site, a
 social events web service has been developed allowing blind users to
 plan a trip to an ASK-IT site. He or she can make a booking so that a
 Braille map of the city would await him or her at the airport, as well as
 specially arranged personal transport to his or her hotel. The hotel will
 be fully accessible with Braille text, and announcements and guiding
 trails all over. Also, advice on nearby accessible restaurants and cafes
 is given, including route guidance on user's mobile or Personal Digital
 Assistant (PDA) on accessible routes.
</p>
<p> 
 At the end of the project, users will pay a small premium of 10 to 30
 euros to have the ASK-IT software on their mobile device and a
 monthly or yearly fee or a pre-paid card depending on the country.
 Then services may be free, such as information from municipalities
 although each connected service or content provider can have its own
 pricing policy.
</p>
<p> 
 The tests of individual modules and services are planned to start in
 October 2007, while the integrated system will be tested a couple of
 months later. The first set of results will be reported by the end of the
 year and results from the whole project will be reported at the ASK IT
 International Conference in June 2008.
