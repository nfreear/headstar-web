<h3 id="i96-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Technology Giants Forge Accessibility Alliance.</h3>
<p> 
 A group of the world's leading technology companies have forged a
 new alliance to harmonise accessibility standards, techniques and tools
 in a move one leading accessibility analyst is calling "the most exciting
 and significant accessibility development of the past 12 months."
</p>
<p> 
 Founder members of the Accessibility Interoperability Alliance (AIA -
 <a href="http://www.accessinteropalliance.org">http://www.accessinteropalliance.org</a>
 ) include Adobe, BayFirst Solutions, HP, Microsoft and Novell, as well
 as specialist assistive technology companies such as Claro Software,
 Dolphin Computer Access, GW Micro, HiSoftware, Madentec,
 Texthelp Systems and QualiLife.
</p>
<p> 
 The group will collaborate on a range of engineering projects intended
 to increase interoperability between existing technologies; design new
 technologies or solutions; improve developer guidelines; lower
 development costs; and increase accessibility innovation.
</p>
<p> 
 Initial projects will include developing a set of keyboard shortcuts to
 provide consistent behaviour to users of assistive technology products
 in any web browser; improving the interoperability and exchange of
 information between IT hardware and software and assistive
 technology (AT) products; and adding accessibility features and
 capabilities to software user interfaces.
</p>
<p> 
 "Today, developers must work across divergent platforms, application
 environments and hardware models to create accessible technology for
 customers with disabilities," Rob Sinclair, director of the Accessibility
 Business Unit at Microsoft, said in a statement issued at the alliance's
 launch last week. "The AIA is an opportunity for the entire industry to
 come together to reduce the cost and complexity of accessibility,
 increase customer satisfaction, foster inclusive innovation, and
 reinforce a sustainable ecosystem of accessible technology products."
</p>
<p> 
 The project could also create new markets for existing specialist
 accessibility technologies, the alliance said. "This is the most exciting
 and significant accessibility development of the past 12 months," Julie
 Howell, Director of Accessibility at web design agency Fortune
 Cookie and former head of accessibility at RNIB told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "Equality for disabled people means access to the same content at the
 same time, in the same time, at the same cost and with the same ease as
 everyone else. The battle for e-accessibility will be won when the
 developers of tools that author and access web content work together in
 harmony. Access technology developers have worked with mainstream
 IT developers in the past, and when they have, disabled people have
 benefited."
</p>
<h3 id="i96-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Eu Countries Set To Miss 2010 Accessibility Targets.</h3>
<p> 
 European member states are in danger of missing targets for a more
 inclusive information society pledged for achievement by 2010,
 according to a major new international study published by the
 European Commission last month.
</p>
<p> 
 A pattern of "eAccessibility gaps, deficits and patchworks" was
 revealed by the study, 'Measuring progress of eAccessibility in
 Europe' (MeAC) (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/meac1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/meac1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 In a declaration made in Riga in 2006, EU ministers pledged to halve
 the gaps in computer literacy and access across Europe and ensure all
 public websites are accessible by 2010. However progress remains
 "fragmented and slow", the new study finds, and "most of the Riga
 objectives will not be met on time". More than one in three Europeans
 are still excluded from fully benefiting from the digital society, it finds.
</p>
<p> 
 The report says: "Accessibility of public websites remains stuck at 5
 per cent. Only 10 per cent of people aged over 64 are internet users
 while the average in Europe is 47 per cent. Without further
 intervention, the gap will only be halved in 2015 instead of 2010."
 Lower-educated, economically inactive and elderly people at the
 greatest risk of being left behind, the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the research says there is evidence of the effectiveness of
 EU-level policies in progressing e-accessibility in Europe, and
 acknowledges legislative progress made by three individual states:
 Italy, Spain and the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 In an attempt to accelerate progress, the commission has adopted a new
 framework to integrate e-Inclusion actions across Europe, and is
 considering new legislative measures similar to the accessibility
 aspects of the US Americans with Disabilities Act.
</p>
<p> 
 It has also launched a year-long awareness campaign for 2008 entitled
 'e-Inclusion, be part of it!', to culminate with a ministerial conference
 to reinforce commitments at all levels (see
 <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/einclusion">http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/einclusion</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Speaking at the campaign's launch Viviane Reding, EU Commissioner
 for Information Society and Media, said: "It is neither morally
 acceptable nor economically sustainable to leave millions of people
 behind, unable to use information and communications technologies to
 their advantage.
</p>
<p> 
 "Progress has been only half as fast as it should be. The commission is
 sending today a clear signal to all parties concerned: industry,
 regulators and governments that we must act together now to ensure a
 barrier-free information society for all."
</p>
<h3 id="i96-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Tourism Websites Fall Short On Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Almost all UK tourism websites are failing to meet basic acceptable
 standards of accessibility, according to a new report from technology
 access charity AbilityNet.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, the latest in a series of 'State of the eNation' surveys by the
 charity, assessed ten websites at random from a list of the most popular
 UK visitor attractions. The sites were rated using a five star scale from
 'very inaccessible' (one star) to 'very accessible' (five stars), with
 three stars representing an 'adequate' level of accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Only one of the ten sites examined - the Glasgow Science Centre - met
 or exceeded this 'adequate' threshold. The centre's site
 (<a href="http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org">http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org</a>
) has been improved in the past year with accessibility in mind and as a result achieved four stars.
</p>
<p> 
 Of the other sites assessed, four achieved two stars (the Eden Project,
 The Giant's Causeway, National Waterfront Museum and Portmeirion)
 and five were deemed very inaccessible, receiving only one star
 (Belfast Zoo, The Burns Heritage Museum, Edinburgh Castle, Kew
 Gardens and the London Eye).
</p>
<p> 
 Sites which fail to meet the three-star level may be falling short of
 service access requirements set out in the UK's Disability
 Discrimination Act, AbilityNet says.
</p>
<p> 
 The report took into account sites' compliance with the international
 World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines, as well as the practical difficulties that visitors with a range
 of disabilities may experience. Among the features that cause problems
 are small text that cannot be resized; unnecessary complexity; closely
 clustered buttons; unlabeled images and over-reliance on visual clues.
 Since the audit was taken at least three of the single-star-rated
 attractions have expressed a commitment to improving the accessibility
 of their websites.

<h3 id="i96-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Misplaced Responsibility?</h3>
<p>  Linda Woodbury, a reader in San Diego, California, sends in some striking general observations on
 accessibility that make particularly interesting reading alongside this
 issue's announcement of a new accessibility alliance between a group
 of major technology firms (see story one, News, this issue).
</p>
<p> 
 She writes: "Why do you think that we continue to develop technology
 for blind persons to read appliances, digital read-outs, signs and street
 information, etcetera, etcetera, when the blind person then is always
 responsible for determining which device to use, often affording the
 cost, and burdened with carrying extra equipment everywhere?
</p>
<p> 
 "Wouldn't it seem more advantageous to press hard for all corporations
 and government entities to simply offer built-in accessibility into their
 products, services and marketing efforts wherever it is at all possible?
 Simple solutions which cost only a minor change in product
 development and packaging would seem a good start. To this point, it
 always seems the responsibility of the blind individual, who often has
 the least resources, to bear the cost."

<h3 id="i96-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Ubuntu Update:</h3>
<p>  Jeff Seager, Communications Specialist at the West Virginia Division of Rehabilitation Services, writes in to add to
 his Inbox contribution in our last issue. Jeff had sung the praises of the
 Ubuntu brand of Linux for prioritising accessibility by automatically
 installing the open source 'Orca' screen reader software.
</p>
<p> 
 He now adds: "A few days after my first note to you, I realised that the
 Lynx text browser also was installed by default in the new 7.10 version
 of Ubuntu Linux. I hadn't noticed this sooner because I'd installed and
 customised Lynx myself in Ubuntu 7.04, and my customised version
 remains intact.
</p>
<p> 
 "Like the default GUI web browser in Ubuntu, the newly installed
 Lynx opens (the first time, and until you change the home page) with a
 page tailored for new users of Ubuntu, linking to more Ubuntu learning
 resources. Nicely implemented accessibility for those who need or
 prefer a text-only browser."

<h3 id="i96-11"><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Unequal Opportunity:</h3>
<p>  Further to our contribution last month from reader Norman Waddington, who experienced accessibility difficulties
 applying for a job online with a local authority, another reader, David
 Rosser, writes in to offer his own similar experience.
</p>
<p> 
 "I can sympathise and relate to Norman Waddington's article on the
 difficulties experienced applying for a job.
</p>
<p> 
 "I myself am visually impaired and recently tried to apply for a job
 online with the NHS and found it less than user-friendly. I visited my
 local job centre and asked for a hard copy of the application form and
 was told by the job centre I would not get an interview as they prefer
 online applications.
</p>
<p> 
 "I feel more should be done in improving the accessibility of online
 application forms to enable people with visual impairments to have
 equality. Improving online applications for jobs would be a positive
 step for everyone as it would make the lives of visually impaired
 people easier but also sighted people as well."

<p>  Alex Stobart of the Scottish Executive writes in to draw E-Access Bulletin readers' attention to 'BarcampUKGovWeb', a
 proposed two-day 'Barcamp' meeting he is helping to organise to
 discuss issues relating to government websites. The event is planned
 for the weekend of 26 and 27 January 2008 in central London.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'barcamp' format refers to a new, informal style of event that is
 planned collaboratively online, with everyone who plans to attend also
 pledging to help out in some way with speaking, chairing or
 organisation. Stobart says that one of the participants has specifically
 asked that the organisers invite people from the accessibility
 community, and this is why he has written in to this newsletter.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special Report, Part One- UK Newspaper Web Sites and Accessibility.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i96-15"><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Here Is The News - If You Can Find It.</h3>
<p> 
 In the world before the internet, blind people had to rely on a limited
 range of newspaper articles - selected by others - being deemed
 suitable for translation into Braille or other formats, and posted out far
 too late to be meaningfully termed 'news'.
</p>
<p> 
 With the web, theoretically the playing field is levelled; anyone who
 can access a computer including blind screen-reader users and people
 with impaired vision can access the websites of the major newspapers
 at the same time as everybody else, reading the headlines as they break
 and picking the articles they want to read - however trashy - from the
 entire range.
</p>
<p> 
 That is, of course, assuming that the newspaper websites are accessible
 to screen-readers and other special access technologies. But according
 to a major new piece of research into the accessibility of newspaper
 websites from the specialist journalism news site Journalism.co.uk, this
 is not a safe assumption.
</p>
<p> 
 Last month Journalism.co.uk asked a group of blind or visually-
 impaired volunteers to carry out user testing on eight of the main
 national newspaper sites: the Express; the Guardian; the Independent;
 the Daily Mail; the Mirror; the Sun; the Daily Telegraph; and the
 Times. The volunteers were John Allnutt, a JAWS screen-reader user
 (version 3.7), and three young students from the Royal London Society
 for the Blind's Dorton College: Rosie Johnson, Josh Pinnell and
 Charlotte West.
</p>
<p> 
 The group was asked to carry out a series of tasks on each site
 including to access the current lead story at each website; navigate to a
 news story of interest to them away from the home page; locate and
 play a piece of audio or video; use the search function to track down a
 story; find and interact with the blogs or reader feedback sections; and
 locate the accessibility information section, if present. They were also
 invited to record their general overall impressions of each site.
</p>
<p> 
 The results were mixed, to say the least. Only the Guardian and the
 Daily Mail websites were found to have sections dedicated to
 accessibility, and only the Daily Mail provided a text-only version of
 its website for blind and visually impaired people. No newspaper site
 has yet earned an RNIB 'See It Right' logo, awarded for excellence in
 this area.
</p>
<p> 
 Navigation around the sites by screen-reader users and people with
 impaired vision was often hampered by confusing site layouts and
 structures, and pop-up advertisements that appeared without warning
 and with no textual explanation.
</p>
<p> 
 All the sites did have at least some positive features relating to
 accessibility, though there was little consistency throughout, and they
 all presented the volunteers with problems as well.
</p>
<p> 
 Analysing the results for Journalism.co.uk, Richard Warren, technical
 manager at web usability consultancy Userite, said: "None of the eight
 newspapers reviewed have grasped the fundamental difference
 between the internet and the print media. All have tried to replicate the
 look of their printed version and just added a confusing set of
 navigation menus.
</p>
<p> 
 "The result is a collection of cluttered pages that are not very user-
 friendly and make little, or no, concession to disabled users."
</p>
<p> 
 A common problem found by the survey was the need to listen to an
 extensive list of links (navigation menus) and other page furniture
 before getting to the main content of the page, Warren said. This is
 because Jaws (and other assistive software) reads the page in the order
 in which it is written.
</p>
<p> 
 "The sighted user has his or her attention drawn to the main story in
 the middle of the page by the colour and size of the headline font and
 associated images. The blind user has to listen whilst Jaws works it
 way through all the menus, advertisements and other clutter on the
 page," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "There is an easy solution to [this] problem, which is to introduce a
 new link at the top of the page that takes the user directly to the main
 page content thus avoiding all the navigation links. The Mirror, Daily
 Mail and Guardian each provide this option with varying degrees of
 success.
</p>
<p> 
 "The Guardian and Daily Mail even try to provide a selection of
 shortcut keys [but] this technology is incorrectly implemented on both
 newspapers and could cause users to save unwanted files on their
 computer rather than navigate to the required page."
</p>
<p> 
 A second, common problem found by the research was the use of pop-
 up windows. "These are annoying for sighted readers, but they can be a
 disaster for the blind who often have no way of knowing that the focus
 of Jaws has changed from the main page to a pop-up window," said
 Warren.
</p>
<p> 
 "As a result the reviewer tried to continue navigating as if he was on
 the original page and got totally lost."
</p>
<p> 
 Some features of the sites would cause problems not just for those with
 impaired vision but for people with impaired movement as well, the
 research found. Many of the sites use pull-down menus for navigation,
 but sighted people with limited mouse control would often be unable to
 select accurately from these menus. The cursor frequently loses its
 focus on the menu, which then closes before they have had time to
 select the desired option, Warren said.
</p>
<p> 
 Other problems were experienced by the volunteers in accessing the
 sites' video news content and interactive blogs. "Videos and blogs are
 newer technologies so the accessibility functions might not be as well
 known. However this is still not an excuse for not trying," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Videos should have an alternative transcript of the associated audio
 available for deaf people to read and an alternative text description of
 the scene/s to enable blind people to put the audio into context."
</p>
<p> 
 The solution to most of these issues is to follow the main accepted
 international standards for web accessibility, Warren said. "The Daily
 Mail provided a text-only version of its website for blind and visually
 impaired people, but the link to this was so far down the page that
 blind people may fail to find it. However, the provision of text-only
 pages is not the only, or indeed the most desirable, solution for
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 "The newspapers tested could easily apply the W3C Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to their existing content, make
 better use of their style sheets so that important content is coded near
 the top of the page and use the HTML codes for headings and lists in a
 proper manner."
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the newspapers themselves could lose out by failing to
 properly embrace issues of accessibility, says Oliver Luft of
 Journalism.co.uk. "Despite the obvious benefits for users, good
 accessibility has advantages for publishers, including higher ranking
 and more matches from search engines, which can more accurately
 index the content," Luft says.
</p>
<p> 
 "Yet these benefits are overlooked by many of the UK's major
 newspapers in their online strategies."

<h3 id="i96-14"><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Mixed Bag:</h3>
<p>  Selected Findings from the Journalism.co.uk Study.</p>
<p> 
 The specialist website Journalism.co.uk has published an in-depth
 study into the accessibility and usability of the websites of the UK's
 main national newspapers (see Section Three, this issue). In part two of
 our report on this study, we present a round-up of the good points and
 bad points of all the sites surveyed.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Express
 <a href="http://www.express.co.uk">http://www.express.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: Good layout of blogs section, which lists content in a
 similar style to news articles, with an appropriate headline indicating to
 the screen reader user what lies behind each link.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: The site's search engine, instead of immediately
 informing the user of how many results they have and displaying them,
 presented the volunteers with out of context links to Madeleine
 McCann and Princess Diana among the first returns with no
 explanation that these were commonly-searched-for terms.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Guardian
 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">http://www.guardian.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: The site - a favourite with volunteers - features an
 accessibility tool as the third link read out by JAWS on entering a
 page. While this resizing tool - aimed at users with visual impairments
 - does feature on other newspaper sites, it is rarely so prominent.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: Takes JAWS users a long time to tab through to the top
 news stories of the day in the site's navigation bar. "Sighted users
 might be able to identify where the news content is instantly, but I have
 no idea. JAWS has to work its way through all these different sections
 first," said John Allnutt.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Independent
 <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk">http://www.independent.co.uk</a>

 Good news: The website includes a tool to resize fonts at the bottom of
 the page, which is useful to visually impaired users. And the paper
 says: "We are currently in the process of redesigning the website and
 are taking accessibility into account, not least by retaining scaleable
 fonts."
</p>
<p> 
 Bad news: A recent redesign of the blogs section has given it a layout
 completely at odds with the rest of the site. The blogs page also
 contained some pop-up advertising, confusing for screen reader users.
 Overall, the volunteers found this site one of the hardest to use.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Daily Mail
 <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk">http://www.dailymail.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: The site makes regular use of a 'skip to main navigation'
 link, which allowed the volunteers to bypass much of the extraneous
 navigational 'furniture' on each page.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: A change of left-hand navigation bar in the blogs section
 was disorientating for John, who was uncertain how to navigate from
 this page to other sections of the site.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Mirror
 <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk">http://www.mirror.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: The results pages for a search were not inundated with
 adverts, as was the case on other sites, allowing JAWS to access the
 results more quickly.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: The news navigation process was 'convoluted' and
 'misleading'. A 'skip to main content' link seemed like a promising
 way to avoid adverts, but in fact led John to a long list of showbiz
 news stories rather than the main news section.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Sun
 <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">http://www.thesun.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: The position and heading on the top stories help readers
 with impaired vision identify that they are important. The size of the
 text is good and The Sun's direct style gives a clear impression of what
 story is about.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: The search facility searched the entire world wide web by
 default rather than this website, without informing the user, as the site
 uses a drop down menu rather than radio buttons to change this feature.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Telegraph
 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk">http://www.telegraph.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: When first entering the site, John's screen reader
 immediately began reading the main news content - a rare and
 welcome pleasure.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: Clicking through on a link to an article in the education
 section did not provide instant access to the piece. Instead, JAWS read
 the headline but then had to trawl all the navigation bars and adverts
 before reaching the story.
</p>
<p> 
 - The Times
 <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk">http://www.timesonline.co.uk</a>

 - Good News: Search engine results page was found to be very
 accessible as it was uncluttered and included summaries for each
 result, as well as the author and date of stories listed.
</p>
<p> 
 - Bad News: First the home page reeled off the site's technical
 parameters, then took the volunteers into a host of holiday adverts,
 without any heading identifying them as adverts to screen reader users.
