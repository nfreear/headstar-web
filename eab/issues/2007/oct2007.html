<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Accessibility Ultimatum Proposed For Uk Government Websites.</h3>
<p> 
 Government websites may be stripped of their 'gov.uk' domain names
 if they fail to meet tough new standards of accessibility to web users
 with disabilities, according to confidential draft proposals seen by E-
 Access Bulletin's sister publication E-Government Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The guidelines, entitled 'Delivering inclusive websites: user-centred
 accessibility', are being drafted by the Central Office of Information,
 the Whitehall agency which assists public bodies with communications
 campaigns.
</p>
<p> 
 If approved, they would mean that existing government sites would
 have until December 2008 to meet the 'AA' standard set out in the
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) developed by the
 World Wide Web Consortium. All new sites would have to confirm
 immediately.
</p>
<p> 
 "Any new site approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Public
 Engagement and the Delivery of Service.must conform to these
 guidelines from the point of publication," the draft guidelines state.
 "Continuing standalone sites must achieve this level of accessibility by
 December 2008. Websites which fail to meet the mandated level of
 conformance shall be subject to the withdrawal process for .gov.uk
 domain names, as set out in Naming and Registering Websites."
</p>
<p> 
 Government will have a mountain to climb in order to comply with
 these standards, according to the best available evidence. No
 government websites achieved the 'AA' standard, according to the
 most comprehensive research in this area, published by the Cabinet
 Office in 2005 as part of the UK Presidency of the EU. Just 3 per cent
 of government websites in the EU reached the minimum 'A' standard (
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/coi2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/coi2</a>
 )</p>
<p> 
 The CoI document includes guidance on how to achieve the required
 standards when commissioning new websites, such as how to check
 compliance with WCAG; and how to involve people with disabilities
 in planning and testing the website. Many of the essential elements are
 set out in the Publicly Available Specification (PAS 78:2006) 'Guide
 To Good Practice In Commissioning Accessible Website,' says CoI
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/pas3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/pas3</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 However, the CoI acknowledges that modifying existing websites to
 improve their accessibility will be more difficult and expensive.

<h3 id="i94-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Vision-Impaired It Worker Wins Discrimination Case.</h3>
<p> 
 A vision impaired IT professional has been has been awarded 12,000
 Euros compensation by an industrial tribunal in Ireland after it was
 accepted that a recruitment process used by multinational company
 Siemens discriminated against job applicants with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The Labour Court in Dublin concluded that Martin O'Sullivan 'was
 denied an opportunity to undertake an integral and otherwise integral
 part of the selection process because of his disability. This meant that
 the whole selection process was tainted with discrimination' (see:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/siem1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/siem1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 For O'Sullivan, the hearing concludes a two-and-a-half year struggle to
 show that the recruitment process used by Siemens discriminated
 against vision-impaired applicants because of their disability, in
 contravention of Ireland's Employment Equality Act.
</p>
<p> 
 In November 2004, O'Sullivan applied for a position as an IT Support
 Specialist with Siemens. Applicants were required to complete a
 written assessment and attend an interview, but O'Sullivan's request
 for a copy of the written test in an accessible electronic format was
 refused. "Instead they asked me some questions at the interview. The
 questions which they asked me at the interview were not as
 comprehensive as those which were given to applicants who undertook
 the written test. I formed the opinion that this would place me at a
 disadvantage when it came to assessing my application for the
 position," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 When O'Sullivan was told that his application had been unsuccessful
 he phoned Siemens to find out more. "I was certain that I had been
 discriminated against, so I contacted them . . . to enquire as to whether
 or not my vision impairment was the factor by which they decided not
 to give me the job. They replied 'Yes'," said O'Sullivan.
</p>
<p> 
 Now working for IBM on its Easy Access Web Project, O'Sullivan
 told E-Access Bulletin that the time taken to resolve the issue was the
 most troubling aspect of pursuing Siemens. "I did not find the
 experience [of being cross-examined] very stressful. The only thing
 which was frustrating about it was the length of time it took. Almost
 two and a half years to complete," he said.

<h3 id="i94-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Developers Fight To Save Bbc'S Suspended Learning Resource.</h3>
<p> 
 The developers of a free online learning resource for vision-impaired
 children, originally developed by the BBC but suspended from release
 following anti-competition complaints from private sector educational
 software suppliers, are seeking help to make the resource publicly
 available.
</p>
<p> 
 'Benjamin's house' is a game aiming to teach literacy, Braille, and IT
 through a virtual tour of British poet Benjamin Zephaniah's house. The
 resource is one of hundreds of free online learning resources aimed at
 five- to sixteen-year-old learners with and without a disability
 developed between 2003 and 2006 under the umbrella of BBC's
 'digital curriculum,' also known as 'BBC Jam'.
</p>
<p> 
 But the BBC Trust decided to suspend Jam a month before it was due
 to go live, after legal arguments from private sector companies that it
 would damage their commercial interests. "We have the first English
 and Braille literacy software but we can't launch it," Jonathan Hassell,
 Accessibility Editor of BBC Jam Hassell told delegates at the annual
 RNIB-hosted conference Techshare this month.
</p>
<p> 
 Hassell and co-developer Nick Kind of not-for-profit e-learning
 organisation Spark Learning
 ( <a href="http://www.sparklearning.com/">http://www.sparklearning.com/</a>
 ), of the development team, appealed to delegates for ideas on how to
 take the programme forward. "There's a possibility we can get this out
 there and transform kids' lives," Hassell said. Nick Kind has published
 a blog on the suspension of Jam - originally launched in October 2006
 - at:
 <a href="http://nickkind.blogspot.com/">http://nickkind.blogspot.com/</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 Benjamin's House users encounter colourful characters living in the
 house, including a spider and a hoover, triggering audible poems,
 stories and games about grammar and language, as they navigate
 rooms and furniture. "We wanted to do things that had never been done
 before using the wonderful archive of BBC materials," Hassell told
 delegates. The game has been tested across the country, from
 "Glasgow to Cornwall," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Unusually, it was designed with both vision impaired and sighted users
 in mind.
</p>
<p> 
 All Benjamin's House content has audio output and plain text
 descriptions of the layout of the house including descriptions of the
 sights, sounds and smells of the house are available at each step of the
 "tour." The game was developed for mainly home use to "bridge the
 home-school divide through the internet," said Hassell.

<h3 id="i94-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Chinese Picture:</h3>
<p>  Kevin Chow, a blind person living in Hong Kong, writes in response to the feature published in the last issue 'The
 Distance Between Rights And Reality,' Section Three, by Julie
 Howell. "I read Ms Howell's article on her trip to China with great
 interest. Many of the disadvantaged groups in China are still deprived
 of the benefits of ICT, especially those living in the rural areas, but I
 have witnessed many big strides made by the Chinese Government in
 bridging the digital divide for people with vision impairment in recent
 years," he writes.
</p>
<p> 
 "The following are some of the major programmes and initiatives: In
 2004, the first National Accessible Information Conference was held in
 Beijing, which I believe has now become an annual event. The
 conference, which aims to promote accessible digital technologies and
 electronics services for people with disabilities, has successfully gained
 participation and support from many of the big names in the ICT
 industry, such as Microsoft, IBM and HP.
</p>
<p> 
 "The China Disabled Person's Federation (CDPF) has rolled out free
 ICT training classes in its centres in many of the cities to teach vision-
 impaired people to use computers and browse the net.
</p>
<p> 
 "The most significant initiative however, is its support provided for the
 development of assistive tools for the disabled. In China, you can
 acquire a Chinese screen reader with reasonable functions, nothing
 compared with that of JAWS or SuperNova, for around 60 pounds, a
 mobile phone with built-in, fully-fledged speech-enabled functions for
 well under 70 pounds, and a speech-enabled MP3 machine for a mere
 40 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 "In regarding to digital divide in developing countries, I reckon the
 hardest hurdle for vision-impaired people in closing the gap is the
 prohibitive high price tag that comes with most of the assistive tools
 now produced in western countries. China is worthy of exploration in
 sourcing affordable assistive aids for people in need. Anybody who
 wishes to discuss more on the above is welcome to contact me:

<h3 id="i94-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Sound Advice:</h3>
<p>  There have been several responses to John Turley's request for help accessing his Apple iPod. He wanted to know
 if on-screen information could be made audible. Rich Caloggero,
 Accessibility Researcher with the National Center for Accessible
 Media suggests he should download 'Rockbox':
 <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">http://www.rockbox.org/</a>
</p>
<p> 
 Rich says: "This is "firmware," essentially system software, which you
 can load onto your player. It makes the menus and controls talk. I
 haven't got an mp3 player, so have no first hand experience with this,
 but have heard good things about it."
</p>
<p> 
 The Rockbox software will run on a wide range of players including
 most iPods: a full list is on the home page of its website.
</p>
<p> 
 Akbar Currim from Bombay, India also offered advice on Rockbox
 including an online talk: "Archives for the Tech Talk training on
 Rockbox, the open source firmware system that makes many off-the-
 shelf mp3 players accessible, on podcasting, on Windows Vista and
 many others are now available. See:
 <a href="http://accessibleworld.org/show.php?contentid=43">http://accessibleworld.org/show.php?contentid=43</a>
 ."</p>
<p> 
 And Anna Dresner from the US, an author who has written about
 media player accessibility was another recommending RockBox, and
 also writes:
</p>
<p> 
 "There is also a program called VoiceBox that finds the files on your
 player and generates voice clips so that Rockbox can speak file and
 folder names. The software is still under development, so it's not
 always as stable as you would wish, but it can be a good option if you
 don't mind that sort of thing. Check out Brian Hartgen's Portable
 Players Portal at

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Conference Report- Techshare 2007.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i94-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Conventional Access by Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 Access to online services for people with disabilities, including e-
 government services, is set to become a key focus of efforts by the
 United Nations (UN) to promote human rights, delegates heard at
 Techshare 2007, a conference staged by the Royal National Institute
 for Blind People this month
 ( <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare">http://www.rnib.org.uk/techshare</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is the
 first human rights convention adopted this millennium, and almost half
 of the convention is devoted to access to information technologies, said
 Axel Leblois, Director of the Global Initiative for Inclusive
 Information and Communication Technologies (G3ICT).
</p>
<p> 
 "The key aspects are the definition of disability, which takes an
 important step in acknowledging that society bears some responsibility
 for the barriers that people with disabilities face. Also significant is the
 focus on use of ICTs. There are 32 articles, and 14 deal with ICTs,"
 said Leblois, whose organisation is leading the UN effort to discover
 what progress nations have made in ensuring that technology is
 accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 114 countries have signed the convention since it was introduced
 in March 2007, said he said. The next step is for these countries to
 ratify the convention, implementing its articles in national legislation,
 where necessary, he said. "In the short term, most states will be
 looking at their own legislation and comparing it with the Convention.
 Some will have to introduce a lot of new legislation. Others, such as
 the UK for example, will be identifying any holes and taking steps to
 fill the gaps," said Leblois. The public sector will have a key role in
 helping to put the Convention into practice, he said. "Government has
 to do something. In many cases it will be changing procurement rules,
 starting with public procurement," said Leblois.
</p>
<p> 
 Later in the day, Leblois led a round-table discussion with participants
 from across all sectors to identify examples of good practice in
 ensuring that new technologies are accessible to people with
 disabilities. The public sector in the UK has based its approach on two
 main pillars: legislation and standards, participants said. The Disability
 Discrimination Act sets out the main legal requirements of access to
 technology, including special provisions for the public sector such as
 the Disability Equality Duty, which requires public bodies to actively
 promote the interests of people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK government has also mandated standards for public sector IT,
 to ensure that online services are of a consistently high quality,
 participants said. Some of these standards, such as the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines drafted by a special interest group of the
 World Wide Web Consortium, are international, while others are
 "home grown", Leblois heard.
</p>
<p> 
 This approach has delivered improvements, but the UK public sector
 could do more to improve the accessibility of e-services, participants
 said. Mandatory standards and legislation can encourage a "tick-box"
 approach to accessibility, rather than a focus on the needs of end-users,
 Leblois was told. Some UK government websites comply with
 accessibility requirements in a technical sense, but are still difficult and
 unrewarding to use by people with disabilities, the meeting was told.
 More effort has gone into promoting accessibility standards for e-
 services than in sharing good practice and actively helping bodies who
 are struggling. Little effort is made to check compliance with
 standards.
</p>
<p> 
 In many public bodies it is difficult to identify a single person or
 department in a public sector organisation who is responsible for
 accessibility of e-services, participants said. Until relatively recently
 UK e-government had a champion in the form of the e-Envoy, but
 holders of this post, first Alex Allan and subsequently Andrew Pinder,
 were charged with promoting e-services to the public sector to migrate
 rather than accessibility specifically, Leblois heard. Ultimately,
 responsibility for central government websites has been spread
 between the Cabinet Office, the Central Office of Information, and the
 Department for Work and Pensions, participants said.
</p>
<p> 
 This lack of ownership can also has be seen at local government level,
 participants said. However, some councils have made good progress
 and central government could learn from their example, Leblois heard.
 Participants said the achievements of individual councils can often be
 attributed to a desire to distinguish themselves from neighbouring
 authorities, or in being lucky enough to have staff with a strong
 personal commitment to accessibility. Local government also examines
 its own achievements with initiatives such as the annual 'Better
 Connected' survey of council websites, run by the Society of IT
 Management, the meeting heard. The only other publicly available
 assessments of how well government is progressing comes through the
 efforts of organisations such as RNIB to reward good practice, but
 awards ceremonies are no substitute for a comprehensive audit of
 accessibility, Leblois heard. Overall, the result is patchy progress
 across government.
</p>
<p> 
 The first visible impact of the convention will be the publication this
 month of G3ICT research falling under four themes: examples of good
 practice; analysis of the barriers to accessibility by private sector
 suppliers; standards, and how they can be harmonised; and legislation
 and regulations, Leblois said. The research will be published in print
 and accessible electronic formats, he said. "We want to encourage
 feedback. We would like to see people sending us their own case
 studies," he said.

<p> 
 The Open University is the only university in the United Kingdom
 dedicated to distance learning, with a mission to be "open to people,
 places, methods and ideas". It is one of the largest universities in
 Europe, with approximately 150,000 undergraduate students, and 1 in
 20 of these students declare some type of disability.
</p>
<p> 
 In October 2005, the Open University adopted the open source learning
 software system 'Moodle' as its virtual learning environment. Moodle
 is a learning or course management system that supports an
 educational model whereby learners are also teachers, and vice versa.
 Students, teachers and lecturers access Moodle over the internet via
 their Web browser.
</p>
<p> 
 The software was first developed by Martin Dougiamas from Perth,
 Australia as a PhD project in 2002, based on his experiences as a
 university system administrator. It is open source, like Linux and
 Mozilla Firefox, which means that anyone can download, modify and
 use it for teaching. Its name stands for 'Modular Object-Oriented
 Dynamic Learning Environment', and there are many modular
 activities that can be mixed and matched: blog, forum, glossary, quiz,
 wiki and so on. There are various other plug-in features available
 including course formats, question types, text filters, language packs
 and themes (for styling) - about 20 in all.
</p>
<p> 
 There are now more 25,000 registered Moodle user sites in
 universities, colleges, schools, government and companies across the
 world, in 75 languages. The Open University has funded and
 contributed a lot of development work to the project since 2005,
 including necessary improvements to accessibility (together with the
 Italian research groups FORMEZ and ISS). The worldwide use of
 Moodle ensures that these advances will affect many users in the
 university, the UK and beyond.
</p>
<p> 
 Since February 2006 ongoing expert evaluations of accessibility have
 been conducted. These have covered the majority of available Moodle
 tools and activities. The initial testing fed into a long list of issues
 that became the specification for further accessibility developments.
 Regular evaluations with students are also being conducted, involving
 disabled and non-disabled students. Three rounds of evaluations have
 occurred since December 2006, involving 32 students, of whom 14
 have disabilities. These have focused on course web sites, forum, wiki,
 quiz, and profile. These student evaluations are observational sessions
 using the 'think aloud' technique while students conduct realistic tasks
 in an educational context.
</p>
<p> 
 The accessibility problems that have been identified during expert and
 student evaluations are in the process of being fixed in each new
 Moodle release. In Moodle 1.6, released in June 2006, some missing
 ALT text was provided, heading markup was used for headings, layout
 tables were removed, colour contrast was improved, and list markup
 was used for lists.
</p>
<p> 
 In version 1.8, released in March 2007, a forms library was adopted in
 order to standardise forms to use appropriate form markup, and this
 work is still ongoing. Some deprecated tags were removed, keyboard
 shortcuts were added to the text editor, alternatives were provided
 where colour or format were used alone to convey information,
 additional list markup was added, and there was work to ensure that all
 aspects are usable without Javascript.
</p>
<p> 
 In the next release, due in October 2007, it is anticipated that there will
 be further improvements to form markup, and list markup will be
 added. There are further outstanding issues which it is hoped will be
 addressed in future versions of Moodle (version 2.0 is expected mid-
 2008) including removal of remaining layout tables, further forms
 improvement, and removal of remaining deprecated tags.
</p>
<p> 
 Clearly there are challenges when working on this type of large-scale
 project. Firstly there is the difficulty of fixing accessibility issues
 retrospectively. Moodle is a large and complex system with over 1
 million lines of code in the core product, and an estimated
 development time of 275 person-years. Developers use a wide range of
 tools and searching for and fixing problems within it is not a trivial
 task. Secondly, while it will be possible to resolve the user interface
 accessibility problems, it is more difficult to ensure teacher and
 student-generated material will be accessible. For example, when using
 collaborative tools such as wikis and forums it is difficult to ensure that
 students use heading tags for headings and meaningful text in links
 when creating online content. Of course this is an issue for all
 user-generated online content.
</p>
<p> 
 Other challenges include raising the awareness of accessibility issues
 and techniques among an international group of paid and volunteer
 developers and maintainers from a diverse range of backgrounds. This
 is particularly an issue for third party modules, themes and language
 packs.
</p>
<p> 
 The potential of online learning to widen participation should
 transform the educational experience for many, including those with
 disabilities. We hope that the accessibility improvements being undertaken
in Moodle will help achieve this goal. To find out more, please visit:
