 Section One: News.
</p>
<h3 id="i90-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Software 'Accessibility Passport' Gains Stamp Of Approval.</h3>
<p> 
 Successful trials have been completed of an "accessibility passport" for
 educational software which provides far more detailed information
 about a product than current accessibility standards, E-Access Bulletin
 has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Rather than simply stating that a product complies with a recognised
 accessibility standard, the passport system would include a description
 of what a product is and how it can be used, possibly including
 assessments by teachers and developers.
</p>
<p> 
 A logo or kitemark could be used to indicate that a product has an
 accessibility passport, but wouldn't necessarily specify all the detail it
 contains, according to said Adrian Higginbotham, Accessibility
 Content Manager at the British Educational Communications and
 Technology Agency
 ( BECTA - <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">http://www.becta.org.uk/</a>
 ). Users could be directed to a central repository such as a website where
 all this information is held, said Higginbotham.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition to Becta, the pilot also included Teachers Evaluating
 Educational Multimedia
 ( TEEM - <a href="http://www.teem.org.uk/">http://www.teem.org.uk/</a>
 ), which provides independent assessment of products, and around 40
 software developers, he said. The concept of the passport grew out of
 work by TechDis, the government-funded agency for technology and
 disability in education, said Higginbotham.
</p>
<p> 
 The passport proposal reflects growing interest in the concept of the
 "flexibility" of a product, as distinct from its accessibility. Flexibility
 reflects how a product can be adjusted to meet a specific need, rather
 than the typical standards-based approach, which tests compliance with
 rigidly defined criteria. "It's early, we're only just starting to ask
 ourselves questions about flexibility," Higginbotham told delegates at
 E-Access '07, a conference organised by Headstar, publisher of E-
 Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 People interested in the accessibility passport idea and want to make
 suggestions, receive more information, or participate in further trials
 should contact John Sewell, Senior Advisor with TechDis at
 <a href="mailto:john@techdis.ac.uk">john@techdis.ac.uk</a> .</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Eu Accessibility Laws Reach "Critical Moment", Says Mep.</h3>
<p> 
 The EU is set to step up its activities to ensure digital technologies are
 more accessible to citizens with disabilities, according to MEP Richard
 Howitt, president of the European Parliament's All-Party Disability
 Intergroup.
</p>
<p> 
 By the end of the year, the European Commission will publish three
 key pieces of legislation, Howitt told delegates at E-Access '07, the
 annual conference organised by Headstar, publisher of E-Access
 Bulletin. This summer, a new framework policy will be published
 under the inclusion strand of the EU's 'i2010' information society
 action plan that is expected to shift accessibility requirements more in
 favour of the end user, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Until now, EU policy on accessibility has focused more on providers
 of content and services rather than end users, said Howitt. "It doesn't
 make sense if content is accessible, but terminals are not," he said.
 "2007 is a critical moment in the EU in terms of addressing access to
 technology," said Howitt.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition a new communication on digital inclusion will be published
 by the Commission, and a revised anti-discrimination directive is due
 by the end of the year, Howitt told delegates. These new EU policies
 will tighten up the requirements on private sector suppliers, possibly
 including a new certification scheme for accessibility; and widen the
 accessibility requirements on public sector procurement, Howitt told
 delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 However, we must not be complacent, said Howitt. He urged delegates
 and readers to show public support for improved EU anti-
 discrimination law by signing up to an online petition organised by the
 European Disability Forum:
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/edf1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/edf1</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 During the final keynote session, Dr Paul Timmers, head of the
 eInclusion Unit at the European Commission also invited public
 participation. To be effective, EU policy must be effective and
 efficient, complete and coherent, future-proof and technology-neutral,
 he said. "We're going through an assessment of all these issues now,"
 said Dr Paul Timmers, head of the eInclusion Unit at the European
 Commission. "I invite everybody to get involved in the discussion," he
 said. A dedicated website has been set up for this purpose, he said:
 <a href="http://www.ipolicy.eu/">http://www.ipolicy.eu/</a>

<h3 id="i90-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Online Library Services Inspired By 'Amazon' Stores.</h3>
<p> 
 Ordering accessible books held by public libraries and charities such as
 the RNIB could become as simple as the "one-click" services offered
 by online bookstores such as Amazon, according to plans being co-
 ordinated by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, E-Access
 Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The vision of a simpler way to order accessible library books is being
 explored as part of a plan to integrate catalogues from the RNIB and
 the former National Library for the Blind (NLB) with new search
 facilities for public libraries, according to Sarah Wilkie, Programme
 Manager at the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council
 ( MLA - <a href="http://www.mla.gov.uk/">http://www.mla.gov.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "At this stage it is still a vision, but we think that ordering a library
 book should become more like using a service like Amazon," Wilkie
 told E-Access Bulletin. "We think there would be interest in a range of
 services. A library user could be offered a range of options such as
 having it delivered to a local library, or possibly direct to their home
 for a fee. They may also be offered the opportunity to buy a book," she
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 The first big milestone on the way to achieving this will come in early
 2008 when UnityUK, an online catalogue system for public lending
 libraries, is relaunched on a new technology platform that is more
 accessible than used at present. "It will be machine-readable, and
 compatible with screen readers. It will also have clear fonts,
 magnification features, and alternative text where necessary," said
 Wilkie.
</p>
<p> 
 Between now and then a significant amount of work also needs to be
 done on the content of the UnityUK, Wilkie said. "At the moment,
 records just say if a title is accessible but don't say how specifically -
 whether it's an audio book, large print, or Braille," for example," she
 said. In addition, library services managed by RNIB, including
 Revealweb, a service originally launched by the former NLB, will be
 integrated into one system. RNIB took over the running of all NLB
 services at the end of 2006.

<p>  Seattle-based speech technology company AudioDizer has launched a product that converts text from news
 websites into high quality podcasts. According to the company,
 AudioDizer converts text into MP3 files that can be read by male or
 female voices that sound similar to radio broadcasts. Apparently, it can
 deliver a variety of accents so that if a story originates from India, an
 Indian voice reads it, or if it comes from the UK, a British voice is
 used:

<h3 id="i90-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Programmer Power:</h3>
<p>  Tedd Sperling has some thoughts to offer about our recent feature article 'Overcoming The Barriers To
 Accessible Websites,' published in the May edition of E-Access
 Bulletin. Tedd writes: "Your article and comments are right on the
 mark. We do need to convince senior management of the need for
 accessibility in web sites. However, there is an additional aspect to
 consider, and that is educating programmers as to "best" practices.
</p>
<p> 
 I am often employed as a programmer by companies to design,
 develop, and make functional web sites and applications. In doing so, I
 quietly add accessibility as best I can. Often, I find that there is no
 additional work that must be conducted to make a site accessible and
 meet the client's needs at the same time. In fact, my most recent
 client's needs were met more efficiently by providing an element of
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Certainly, there are new cool things that catch their eye, but it is a
 challenge to meet the new thing with an accessible solution.
 Sometimes, it works and sometimes it doesn't. But the point is that I
 don't belabor the client with accessibility concerns, I just deal with
 them and the more I know about accessibility needs, the better I can
 change my way of doing things to accommodate both accessibility and
 client needs without degrading either.
</p>
<p> 
 So, as I see it, the more educated the programmer is to accessibility
 concerns, the better."

<p>  A website providing details of facilities for disabled people at stations on the London Underground network, available at
 Direct Enquiries
 ( <a href="http://www.directenquiries.com/">http://www.directenquiries.com/</a>
 ), is of limited value to vision impaired travellers, writes Lynn
 Holdsworth.
</p>
<p> 
 "Whoever came up with the idea of the London Underground guide
 was thinking along the right lines, but as a guide dog user who would
 have liked "turn left after going through the ticket gates" type
 directions, and specific information about alternatives to escalators, it
 didn't give me the information I was looking for," she says.

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: An Opportunity That Must Be Seizedby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 "When people hear the word 'Directive' their eyes tend to glaze over,"
 admitted Richard Howitt MEP, a leading campaigner for disability
 rights in the European Parliament. "Too often, decisions made in
 Brussels can seem remote," he told delegates at E-Access '07, the
 annual conference organised by Headstar, publisher of E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 In fact, policy at an EU level has helped to bring about real changes,
 ensuring that the benefits of new technologies are made available to
 all, said Howitt, who is president of the All-Party Disability Intergroup,
 the main campaign group for disability issues in the European
 Parliament. "Technology should be a beacon of hope," he said.
 However, all too often, advances in technology place more barriers in
 the way of people with disabilities, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 EU policies aimed at these issues include the 2002 framework policy
 on electronic communications
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/2002">http://fastlink.headstar.com/2002</a>
 ), which paved the way for increased awareness of accessibility among
 private sector suppliers, he said. Since 2004, the EU directive on public
 procurement
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/2004">http://fastlink.headstar.com/2004</a>
 ) has helped to ensure that accessibility is taken into account when
 public money is spent on IT, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Two years later, in 2006, changes were made to EU policy on
 structural funds and research
 ( <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html</a>
 ), ensuring that accessibility is a higher priority, he said. "Forty per cent
 of the EU budget is now covered by some form of anti-discrimination
 legislation," said Howitt.
</p>
<p> 
 The momentum is set to increase in the near future, particularly with a
 new policy on digital TV in place since the end of 2006, a new
 framework policy and a communication on digital inclusion due in the
 summer of 2007, and a revised anti-discrimination directive due by the
 end of the year, he said. The Audio Visual Media Services Directive
 (AVMS), adopted in 2006, is a significant move towards widening
 disabled access to TV, said Howitt. "Since the 1970s there has been
 voluntary commitment to this, but it is now a requirement to have
 specific quotas, and to report progress," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In many countries voluntary commitments don't appear to be working,
 he said. "About 0.7 per cent of programmes in Germany are audio-
 described, it is around one film per week in Portugal, and one film per
 month in France," he told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 Howitt hopes that the communication on digital inclusion, due this
 summer, will include proposals for a certification scheme for digital
 technologies, and that requirements for accessibility in public
 procurement will be strengthened. There are two main hurdles for
 accessibility campaigners, he said. Many of the recommendations
 about digital inclusion contained in EU policies such as i2010
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/i2010">http://fastlink.headstar.com/i2010</a>
 ) are optional, not mandatory, said Howitt. In addition, accessibility is
 treated as a social or market-related issue, rather than an access issue.
 "It doesn't make sense if content is accessible, but terminals are not.
 That amounts to a policy failure," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In the final keynote for the day, Dr Paul Timmers, head of the
 eInclusion Unit at the European Commission, agreed that a market-
 based approach will not solve all our problems, although it will make
 an important contribution. "There is a digital opportunity as well as a
 divide. With an aging population there is an opportunity to make e-
 accessibility mainstream. But there will always be some things that
 markets cannot address or solve," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Part of the problem with new technologies is that they don't always fit
 well into the overall structure of EU policy, said Timmers. The
 economy, or social cohesion and quality of life issues are the main
 drivers for EU policy, and access to technology often gets split
 between several policy areas. "The outcome is that issues such as web
 accessibility aren't covered at the European level," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Broadly there are three separate challenges for EU policy on access to
 technology, he said. To be effective and efficient, anti-discrimination
 law must be tested and refined by case law, but this can be a slow,
 piecemeal process. EU policy should be complete and coherent, but
 there is a danger that the public sector will leave the private sector
 lagging behind. Finally, EU policy should be future-proof and
 technology-neutral, and achieving this requires regular updates, said
 Timmers.
</p>
<p> 
 "We're going through an assessment of all these issues now," said
 Timmers. "I invite everybody to get involved in the discussion," he
 said. A dedicated website has been set up for this purpose, he said:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Focus- Second Life.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Outside The Gates Of Second Lifeby Peter Verhoeven.
</h3>
<p> 
 Is a virtual world a venue for entertainment, a game, or a public place
 to meet others? Should it be accessible to everyone? Why doesn't any
 screen reader or screen magnifier let you access Second Life?
</p>
<p> 
 Second Life is a 3-D virtual world entirely built and owned by its
 residents. Since opening to the public in 2003, it has grown explosively
 and today has wet up accounts set up for more than 5 million people
 around the world. I am one of those 5 million people and never could
 log in, because of Second Life's lack of accessibility. Most of those 5
 million accounts are never used.
</p>
<p> 
 On the subject of accessibility, Joshua Linden from Linden Labs, one
 of the folks who help create the Second Life platform, has written:
 "The world, of course, is created by the residents. We are deeply
 committed to making Second Life usable by everyone. A large number
 of Second Life residents have 'First Life' disabilities and enjoy the
 freedoms that a virtual world offers from communication to movement.
 However, we're still a very small company and have limited
 development resources, so we have not been able to do everything we
 want to yet!"
</p>
<p> 
 I think that it is very difficult to make the current client viewer of
 Second Life accessible. With my free Desktopzoom magnifier, I could
 magnify the login screen, enter my log in name and password, but after
 logging in, magnification was turned off and I couldn't bring it up
 again.
</p>
<p> 
 If you launch the Second Life viewer with a screen magnifier such as
 ZoomText, Lunar or iZoom, magnification will be turned off. If you
 access the Second Life viewer with a screen reader like Hal, Jaws or
 Window-Eyes, nothing will be spoken aloud, and nothing will appear
 on your Braille line.

 ) told me that the Second Life viewer and Desktopzoom conflict with
 each other. That is the reason you see the flickering of the login screen
 in Second Life client viewer, while running Desktopzoom.
</p>
<p> 
 Linden Labs has made the Second Life client viewer open source. This
 means that it is at least possible to program other interfaces that
 integrate with Second Life. You can for example think about a virtual
 world with more sound instead of 3-D effects or speech support and
 audio description of 3-D effects.
</p>
<p> 
 Dolphin Computer Access
 (<a href="http://www.yourdolphin.com/">http://www.yourdolphin.com/</a>
) has also highlighted the inaccessibility of Second Life. A spokesperson
 said: "Unfortunately Second Life will not work with [Dolphin's screen
 reader and magnifier] Supernova at this time. The problem that you
 face with trying to run Second Life with magnification software is that
 the game will call up the extended functions of the video card.
</p>
<p> 
 "In order to create magnification, the Dolphin software intercepts
 information passing to the video card. While under normal conditions
 this poses no problem, the extended functions of the video card being
 called by the game cannot get intercepted and therefore will not be
 magnified.If the situation with Second Life changes I will let you
 know, as I know a number of clients who have enquired about this."
 Sometimes I have the impression that every day there are more articles
 written about Second Life, than there are visitors. But all this makes
 me curious and I cannot wait until an accessible client becomes
 available!
