<h3 id="i126-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Association To Set Uk Digital Format Standards.</h3>
<p> 
 The new UK Association for Accessible Formats ( UKAAF:
 <a href="http://www.ukaaf.org/">http://www.ukaaf.org/</a>
 ) is to set national standards next year for accessibility of digital
 formats such as electronic books and synthesised speech, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The association, a charity formed last year, refined its work
 programme for the next two years at its annual general meeting
 in London earlier this month.
</p>
<p> 
 This included setting suggested minimum acceptable standards
 for large print, Braille and audio formats by the end of 2010,
 followed in 2011 by work on standards for synthesised speech,
 electronic books and other digital formats.
</p>
<p> 
 All standards will be aimed at content and service providers;
 transcribers; and end users, Alan Matthews, the association's
 public relations officer, told E-Access Bulletin following the
 meeting. &quot;The goal is to set out an achievable minimum UK
 standard that everyone can work towards, so the odd producer
 out there who is not quite hitting the mark would have
 something to aim at, service providers would have minimum
 requirement for end users, and end users would have minimum
 standard they could expect and service providers could not say
 they can't do it, because of technical issues,&quot; Matthews said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;For example, if I work for a utility, and I know I should
 provide accessible formats, and I want to write them into a
 tender but I don't know what standards to use, I could come to
 UKAAF. Then I would know what I am asking for is
 reasonable, achievable and what the end-user is expecting.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, the association would like its standards to be
 included in government regulations relating to accessibility, he
 said. &quot;If we can be talking to government within five years, it
 would give our work a stamp of authority.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The association will also be looking at how current law in this
 area, including the new Equalities Act 2010 and the Disability
 Discrimination Act 1995 with its provision for 'reasonable
 adjustments' to services, affect the way organisations need to
 take account of format accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The meeting had been due to pass an emergency motion on
 whether to endorse Unified English Braille (UEB) as the
 &quot;preferred&quot; Braille format for UK use, in the face of US moves
 to endorse the alternative Unified Braille Code. However the
 meeting decided to delay a decision pending further
 deliberations.
</p>
<p> 
 Three appointments were made to the board of UKAAF:
 Michael Lewington, Director of Calibre Audio Library; Richard
 West, former chair of BCAB and Sheila Armstrong, text
 transcription co-ordinator at Torch Trust. The association's
 president is former RNIB chairman Lord Low of Dalston.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Public-Private 'Unwillingness To Co-Operate' Over Smarthomes.
</h3>
<p> 
 A coherent national plan is needed to develop integrated
 systems and services for 'smart homes' to meet the needs of
 disabled and elderly people, overcoming &quot;entrenched
 behaviours, convention, ego and unwillingness to co-operate&quot;
 across the public and private sectors, a London seminar heard
 this month.
</p>
<p> 
 Delegates at the 'smart living' seminar heard that although
 many pilot schemes were already testing components of next
 generation home systems, there was little co-ordination
 between the sectors involved including architecture,
 engineering, building, health and care, energy,
 communications, transport and bodies representing disabled
 and older people.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Without such a plan, the situation in five years time is likely
 to be as fragmentary as it is today,&quot; said Professor Patrick Roe
 of the European CARDIAC project (Coordination Action in
 R&amp;D in Accessible and Assistive ICT: <a href="http://www.cardiac-eu.org">http://www.cardiac-eu.org</a>
 ), which aims to create a 'road-map' to co-ordinate
 research in this field.
</p>
<p> 
 Martyn Gilbert of 'UK3.0', a private-sector-led project to
 create &quot;next generation&quot; homes, said the barriers to progress
 lay not with technology but with organisational cultures.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;All of the substantive technology necessary to help older and
 disabled people live as they wish in their own homes is here,
 and has been here for several years. The obstacles are
 entrenched behaviours in the public and private sectors. They
 are obstacles of convention, ego and unwillingness to co-
 operate in good will with other stakeholders.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The nation can no longer afford the luxury of such
 behaviours... it makes societal, business and national sense to
 collaborate to bring about the widest installation of these
 technologies in people's homes.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 UK 3.0 is attempting to co-ordinate private and public sector
 services to smart homes including intelligent energy and water
 management and health promotion, with a target of
 contributing Â&pound;100 billion a year to the UK economy by 2019.
</p>
<p> 
 'Smart Living - the way forward for disabled and older people'
 was hosted by the Department for Business, Innovation and
 Skills (BIS) in association with the accessible ICT charity
 PhoneAbility ( <a href="http://www.phoneability.org.uk">http://www.phoneability.org.uk</a>
 ).</p>

<h3 id="i126-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Danes Are Latest To Miss Eu Web Access Target.</h3>
<p> 
 Some 52% of Danish government websites are not fully
 accessible to citizens with disabilities, new research has
 revealed, in the latest blow for hopes of Europe-wide
 accessibility improvements.
</p>
<p> 
 Conducted on behalf of the Danish Ministry of Science,
 Technology and Innovation, a survey by Sensus - a Danish
 consulting company specialising in accessibility, IT and
 disability - assessed 226 government websites against
 international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG
 2.0)
</p>
<p> 
 The results of the survey are another setback to the goal set at a
 ministerial conference of EU member states in 2006 of all EU
 government websites becoming fully accessible by the end of
 2010. It is now expected that not one state will hit this target.
</p>
<p> 
 The Danish ministry now plans to launch an e-learning tool in
 2011 featuring guidance on creating more accessible websites
 and documents.
</p>
<p> 
 In the UK, guidance from the Central Office of Information on
 'delivering inclusive websites'
 (<a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=131">http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=131</a>
 ) in 2008 stating that all government websites should have
 conformed to international 'AA' standards by 2011. However,
 the public sector Society of IT Management's annual 'Better
 Connected' review of every UK council website, published
 earlier this year, found only 32 of 479 sites achieved even
 basic accessibility levels (see E-Access Bulletin, March 2010
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=400">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=400</a>

<p>  Confirmation that the BBC is to participate in 'Project Canvas', an initiative between major
 broadcasters and telecommunications companies develop a
 standard for internet-linked on-demand services through TV
 sets, has been welcomed by the Royal National Institute of
 Blind People (RNIB). The standard is seen as important for
 ensuring usability and accessibility of such services. However,
 the institute has warned that many blind and partially sighted
 people will not be able to use Canvas on its launch without a
 text-to-speech (TTS) function to navigate the menus, and is
 pushing for a TTS requirement in the project's upcoming
 technical specification:

<p>  A short and sweet request for information from reader Noel Hatch, head of innovation projects and
 research at Kent County Council in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 Noel asks: &quot;I was wondering if there was any research on how
 and what disabled people use digital technologies?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Ideas and links please to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a> .</p>
<h3 id="i126-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Cut Links:</h3>
<p>  Another reader and regular correspondent from the same organisation - Clive Lever, diversity advisor with
 Kent Council - has written in to suggest a change to the way
 we publish web addresses in the bulletin. Clive's suggestion
 was triggered by problems he experienced accessing a long
 web link in our last issue that split over a line.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I did get to the article with an interesting bit of &quot;text knitting&quot;
 in my 'open' slot on Internet Explorer. [But] please may I
 suggest that we consider alternatives to long URLs [uniform
 resource locators, or web links] in newsletters, possibly even as
 part of newsletter accessibility standards?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Clive continues: &quot;I'm a great fan of services like Tinyurl (
 <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com">http://www.tinyurl.com</a>
 - a service that creates short links that expand into longer ones), as you may not always know that
 you haven't pasted in the complete link if you're playing about
 with them in emails.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;If one [format] suits some people and the other suits the rest,
 would it be too much to suggest being greedy and having both?
 My preference would be for the original URL to be used alone,
 except where it looks likely that it could run over two lines,
 when it would be accompanied by a short URL so people
 could chose which one to click.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I'm a great believer in giving people choices, rather than
 having a one-size-fits-all approach.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 [EDITOR'S NOTE: We think this is an excellent suggestion,
 because we have heard both sides now: first, that short link like
 Tinyurl or Bit.ly are themselves not very accessible; and
 second, that longer links are not accessible. To offer both
 would therefore seem logical - but what precise format and
 text layout should we use to do this? Please send in your
 suggestions.]

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Facebook Solutions:</h3>
<p> 
 Last issue, our Italian version translator Margherita Giordano
 asked for advice on overcoming problems with accessing the
 social networking site Facebook, and in particular its chat
 features, using JAWS screen-reader software.
</p>
<p> 
 Jerry Weichbrodt of Michigan writes in to say: &quot;With respect to
 Facebook Chat, I agree that it can be awkward using a screen
 reader. I, too, use JAWS and it's awkward to keep popping in
 and out of Forms Mode to enter text and then look for
 responses.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;One suggestion I have heard of, though I have not tried it
 myself, is to use AIM version 7.2 to access Facebook Chat.
 There is an explanation of this and a demonstration in Freedom
 Scientific's 'FSCast' episode number 40 for March of this year.
 See
 <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/FSCast/episodes/fscast040-">http://www.freedomscientific.com/FSCast/episodes/fscast040-</a>

 march2010.asp .
</p>
<p> 
 Other than that, using the actual Facebook chat page, I believe
 JAWS seems to see two edit boxes that it appears you could
 type into, but only one of them actually works for the
 purpose. [so] it may be useful to arrange to chat with
 someone specifically for experimental purposes and then see
 which edit box actually works for entering text.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Responding to the same appeal, Tim Carrington, a reader from
 Kent, UK (where else?) had a different suggestion: &quot;The
 student should give up on JAWS and consider using WebbIE,
 the free web browser for blind people with little or no sight
 available from
 <a href="http://www.webbie.org.uk">http://www.webbie.org.uk</a>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: The Right To Borrowby Guy Whitehouse.
</h3>
<p> 
 One of the last pieces of legislation passed earlier this year by
 the UK's outgoing Labour government was the Digital
 Economy Act 2010, which, among other things, extended the
 Public Lending Right to audiobooks and ebooks in libraries.
</p>
<p> 
 This transfers out of copyright both physical hardcopy
 audiobooks in libraries, and audio/ebooks downloaded to an
 mp3 player or ebook reader on library premises; authors
 receive a payment from the government for each loan based on
 a rather complicated formula. The US does not currently have
 a similar scheme, following a failed attempt to introduce one in
 the 1980s.
</p>
<p> 
 The UK legislative change represents an attempt to simplify the
 model of lending non-print material in libraries which had
 hitherto occurred under a licensing regime which had never
 really functioned properly. This had made librarians reluctant
 to build up large stocks of such material, although interestingly
 customers seem to welcome audiobooks: the global electronic
 book distribution platform OverDrive has been extending its
 business in the US, and in 2008 there were 11 million loans of
 audiobooks from UK public libraries. Statistics for the year
 2009 will soon be available. There are also some avant garde
 librarians who regard ebooks as key to making libraries
 relevant to younger members.
</p>
<p> 
 Since libraries have always been the key source of income for
 audiobooks on traditional media such as cassette or CD, at least
 in the UK, the change in the law has been broadly welcomed
 by advocacy groups for people with impaired vision. However,
 there are those who are critical, for example objecting to the
 fact that audio- and ebooks accessed remotely via download
 are not covered by the Public Lending Right (government
 lawyers said this was impossible because such activity was
 covered by the authors' right of communication to the public).
 Many, not least the UK Registrar of Public Lending Right, feel
 this is a significant gap because they do not think most people
 download ebooks or e-audiobooks on library premises.
 Nevertheless, it is a step forward.
</p>
<p> 
 Such issues are only going to gain in importance. In 2009 for
 the first time the sales of ebooks were significantly higher than
 those of audiobooks in the US. Many of the most passionate
 advocates of audiobooks are moving to positions in companies
 associated with the download market, and Audible.com
 expanded its catalogue of unabridged audiobooks from 20,519
 in October 2009 to 26,113 titles in May 2010.
</p>
<p> 
 Where does this leave issues relating to the accessibility of e-
 books to people with disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 The recent disputes over the Kindle's text-to-speech and over
 the read-out-loud function of Adobe ebooks in public libraries
 only makes sense in the context of an audiobooks industry
 fearing that in some sense the future is slipping away from it,
 whether those fears are justified or not.
</p>
<p> 
 If downloads are the future, particularly of unabridged
 audiobooks narrated by a human voice, then securing access to
 the internet and to computers in general for the visually
 impaired becomes of ever-greater significance. It would be a
 real tragedy if, just at the moment books become available in
 non-print formats in large numbers, a lack of access to
 technology in general and/or to the internet or mainstream
 ebook readers prevented us from reaping maximum benefit.
</p>
<p> 
 In this regard, ensuring internet accessibility, whether through
 enforcement of guidelines or through user testing, is critical
 and making media players that visually impaired people
 already use capable of playing ebooks and protected audio
 downloads is as important as capturing access to a mainstream
 e-books reader.
