<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Canadian Government Loses Milestone Web Access Case.</h3>
<p>  
 A blind accessibility consultant has won her case against the
 Canadian government for the lack of accessibility on its
 websites, the country's Federal Court has announced.
</p>
<p>  
 As reported in last month's E-Access Bulletin (
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=508">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=508</a>
 ), Donna Jodhan sued the Canadian government after she was unable to apply for a
 government job online or complete an online census form
 without assistance from sighted government employees,
 arguing that this breached her rights.
</p>
<p>  
 Last week, Justice Michael Kelen returned a verdict in favour
 of Jodhan, ruling that the government had infringed the
 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by failing to make
 its websites fully accessible, and was discriminating against
 disabled citizens. The government has now been given 15
 months to make its websites accessible for blind and visually
 impaired citizens.
</p>
<p>  
 “I am humbled and elated that a decision has been made, and
 with great haste,” Jodhan told E-Access Bulletin. “The
 Canadian Government should not view this as a defeat but
 rather as one where we all get to ensure that the future of blind
 and sight-impaired kids will be a better one, where accessibility
 will be a reality. This case was never mine to win but that of
 our blind and sight-impaired community not to lose.”
</p>
<p>  
 The court's ruling stated that Jodhan's inability to access
 government information online “is representative of a system
 wide failure by many of the 146 government departments and
 agencies to make their websites accessible.”
</p>
<p>  
 More on the case can be found on Jodhan's personal blog:
 <a href="http://www.donnajodhan.blogspot.com/">http://www.donnajodhan.blogspot.com/</a>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Digital Government ‘Must Not Increase Exclusion’.</h3>
<p>  
 Digitisation of government services must not take place at the
 expense of increased exclusion of people with disabilities, a
 leading national policy adviser has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p>  
 Felicity Shaw is senior policy advisor for Race Online 2012, a
 campaign headed by the UK's Digital Champion Martha Lane
 Fox to bring online the nine million people in the country who
 have never used the internet ( <a href="http://raceonline2012.org">http://raceonline2012.org</a>
 ).</p>
<p>  
 “We’re making recommendations that government services
 should be digital by default, but part of that is making sure that
 nobody is excluded by that process. Making services digital is
 about making them better, more convenient and easier, not
 about leaving people behind who are excluded,” Shaw said.
</p>
<p>  
 Some of the more difficult and important work for Race
 Online 2012 will be helping people with a range of access
 issues to use the internet for the first time. “What's harder to
 tackle is people who may have multiple barriers to getting
 online, particularly disabled people who might have
 accessibility issues which make it harder or more expensive for
 them to access equipment.
</p>
<p>  
 “What we don’t want is to have a campaign and promote just
 some of the elements that go with that, which ultimately
 increases exclusion for people who can’t get online” said
 Shaw.
</p>
<p>  
 Part of Race Online 2012's work includes a ‘People's
 Taskforce’ ( <a href="http://bit.ly/glTN2w">http://bit.ly/glTN2w</a>
 ), featuring people from a variety of backgrounds who have been helped to go online,
 and are now helping others to use the internet. Members of the
 taskforce are helping to provide the campaign with ideas and
 information about accessibility, including Heather Lyons –
 who is visually impaired and campaigning for more affordable
 assistive technology – and Alan Thomas – who was diagnosed
 with ataxia, and now uses the internet to share information
 about his support website, livingwithataxia.org .
</p>
<p>  
 Shaw was among speaker's at last week's Future Democracy
 ’10, Headstar's annual conference on the use of the internet
 and other new technologies to boost all parts of the democratic
 process ( <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/fdem10">http://www.headstar-events.com/fdem10</a>

<h3 id="i132-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Free Daisy Book Recorder Software Upgraded.</h3>
<p>  
 The latest version of an open source audio recording tool
 designed to allow anyone to produce DAISY format electronic
 books has been released by the global DAISY Consortium of
 blindness organisations, publishers, technology companies and
 others.
</p>
<p>  
 DAISY (digital accessible information system) books created
 with the Obi 1.2 software ( <a href="http://bit.ly/fqzspr">http://bit.ly/fqzspr</a>
 ) can contain chapters, sub-sections and pages, allowing users with print
 disabilities to easily navigate through the content. The Obi tool
 is also fully accessible to screen-readers.
</p>
<p>  
 Version 1.2 of the Obi tool features a number of improvements
 and upgrades for users, including an adaptation to work with
 Microsoft Windows 7. Users can now also manage large
 DAISY production projects more easily; and MP3 and WAV
 format audio files can now be imported into projects.
</p>
<p>  
 All DAISY content is produced to a standard (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/hcPbOF">http://bit.ly/hcPbOF</a>
 ) developed by the DAISY Consortium, whose aim is to see all published information made readily
 available to people with print disabilities through digital talking
 books.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Interview Special Feature- Diane Mulligan OBE.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Podcast PioneerBy Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p>  
 This has been a busy year for Diane Mulligan.
</p>
<p>  
 At the start of 2010 Mulligan was awarded an OBE for services
 to disabled people and equal opportunities. Last week, she was
 back at Buckingham Palace for a reception held by the Queen
 for the Diplomatic Corps. In-between, she has been
 spearheading a campaign to improve the rights of disabled
 people in developing countries, in her role as Global Disability
 Advisor for international charity Sightsavers.
</p>
<p>  
 One of the UK's leading campaigners for disabled people's
 rights worldwide, and a candidate for the 2012 election to the
 UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
 (another of this year's accolades), Mulligan has faced many
 struggles on her path to high achievement.
</p>
<p>  
 Leaving school with few qualifications due to undiagnosed
 dyslexia and ADHD, she has worked in the NGO sector all her
 working life, starting with environmental issues and then
 championing human rights, women's rights and disability
 rights.
</p>
<p>  
 The internet and other technologies play a major role in her life
 and work now, but growing up she lacked the technological
 support on offer to today's schoolchildren like her own 10-
 year-old son, Zephaniah.
</p>
<p>  
 “My son has ADHD and dyslexia, and he is using software that
 helps him, especially with homonyms – he can write ‘no’ and
 know whether it should be spelled ‘know’ or ‘no’ – and
 pictorial software,” she says. “He still can’t hold a pen and
 write, aged 10, but he went straight to using digital technology
 and is now able to produce work of a standard that is really
 high for his age. It's so good for his self-esteem.
</p>
<p>  
 “I left school with hardly any qualifications, but if I had had a
 laptop and software I would have been able to do the same.”
</p>
<p>  
 These learning challenges are not the only problems Mulligan
 has had to overcome: after many years of working abroad, she
 was involved in a serious road accident in Indonesia which led
 to one of her legs being amputated. Returning to the UK, to
 Seaford on the Sussex coast, she received good medical care
 but a lack of proper psychological support spurred her to set up
 the Sussex Amputee Support Group offering advice, emotional
 support and information for people experiencing limb loss.
</p>
<p>  
 The group has its own website (
 <a href="http://www.sussexamputeesupport.co.uk">http://www.sussexamputeesupport.co.uk</a>
 ), a tool which has proven essential to its work building a support community,
 Mulligan says.
</p>
<p>  
 “Getting that up on the internet was really key,” she says.
 “Some people said the information was not accessible to a lot
 of people – most amputees are over 80 – but I disagree: my
 dad is over 80 and he is using online conferencing. But it is
 also all available in large print and other formats.”
</p>
<p>  
 Technology has also helped her with her sporting passion, rifle
 shooting: she was on course to compete in the 2012
 Paralympics until work and family commitments rendered the
 training schedule impossible.
</p>
<p>  
 “It's all done on computers with laser beams from the end of
 the gun onto a screen – they track your movement until you
 fire so you can see how accurate you are, whether you are
 swaying all over the place. But I’ve had to drop out from the
 fast-track now. It takes up at least two evenings a week, and
 every other weekend.
</p>
<p>  
 Computers and the internet have also proven enormously
 valuable with her main current work role. She joined
 Sightsavers in 2007, and is leading the organisation's strategy
 for raising awareness of the link between disability and poverty
 in developing countries, where 80% of disabled people live,
 almost all below the poverty line. In 2000 most world leaders
 signed up to achieving eight ‘anti-poverty’ Millennium
 Development Goals by 2015, but disabled people and
 disability rights are noticeably absent from these goals, and
 much of Mulligan's work with Sightsavers is to campaign for
 their inclusion and recognition.
</p>
<p>  
 With front-line teams in more than 30 countries, the charity has
 created a global online network and uses a web-based
 conferencing facility called Elluminate (
 <a href="http://www.elluminate.com">http://www.elluminate.com</a>
 ).</p>
<p>  
 “It has considerably cut down international travel, and
 colleagues with low vision access the same information I can,”
 Mulligan says.
</p>
<p>  
 “I do three-day training sessions for all my staff and in August
 we piloted doing a session online.
 We had 50 people in Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka, and guest
 speakers, over three days in Sightsavers offices. Everyone
 could access the PowerPoint, raise their online hand. They
 could find out what people could do in different countries and
 share best practice.
</p>
<p>  
 “Now I run one every month, 60 minutes on social inclusion,
 as a round-up and opportunity for any of our 300 employees
 worldwide to ask any questions they have and contribute
 examples. It's almost like a radio show, I can answer questions,
 and I have other people contributing. Once I’d done it once, I
 thought that's the way forward to me – I don’t have to travel, it
 saves me jetlag and means I don’t have to stay away from my
 family.”
</p>
<p>  
 Mulligan records the webinars and puts them onto a podcasting
 site called Podbean ( <a href="http://www.podbean.com">http://www.podbean.com</a>
 ), each bookmarked so people can browse between items without
 having to listen to the whole hour. Currently they are only
 available to Sightsavers staff, but “there are no trade secrets”,
 so Mulligan is looking at ways of making them more widely
 available. The service uses low bandwidth, so it is accessible
 even in places like rural India, she says.
</p>
<p>  
 Another technology that is revolutionising her work is
 ‘phlogging’, a service from a company called ipadio that is
 “like blogging, but using a mobile phone” ( <a href="http://bit.ly/8Q4YF">http://bit.ly/8Q4YF</a>
 ). Users can call in from anywhere in the world and record a
 voice message from their mobile, using local rate numbers, to
 broadcast the voice clip onto their website, blog or social
 network.
</p>
<p>  
 Tools like this and ones that can help speak web content out
 loud can be useful for communication not only with blind
 people but for targeting remote communities who are either
 illiterate or for whom the written word is not the medium of
 choice, Mulligan says.
</p>
<p>  
 “We also try and encourage people to create video diaries, to
 give our supporters an insight into what we do and how we do
 it. And we convert our reports to MP3.”
</p>
<p>  
 Some of these technologies are hard for people in poorer
 countries to access, but there is usually a way, she says. “Even
 if you go to some of the poorest parts of the world you find
 people with mobile phones. In India, social networking is
 massive, and the blind people I know there are using it as much
 as their sighted colleagues. And in countries like Indonesia,
 you see internet cafes on the corner of every street.”
</p>
<p>  
 Sightsavers have also worked with accessible technology
 specialists Dolphin to create the Sightsaver Dolphin pen (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/gWM16t">http://bit.ly/gWM16t</a>
 ), a low cost memory stick carrying magnification and screen-reader software aimed at students in
 developing countries.
</p>
<p>  
 “So there are many new technologies out there, it's just about
 harnessing them. The only stumbling block I’ve got is getting
 someone to get headphones and a mike, and log on. It's that
 barrier of the unknown, people think it's going to be hard. The
 barriers disabled people face in the developing world are
 almost the same as disabled people face here – liberation takes
 place in that space between our two ears, before anywhere
 else.”
