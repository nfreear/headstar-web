<h3 id="i121-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Severely Disabled Pupils Face Wait For Home Access.</h3>
<p> 
 School pupils with serious disabilities are facing an indefinite
 delay, likely to last six months or more, to receive the assistive
 technology they need to benefit from the government's new
 'Home Access' computer scheme, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The Â&pound;300 million scheme ( <a href="http://www.homeaccess.org.uk/">http://www.homeaccess.org.uk/</a>
 ), managed by education ICT agency Becta (
 <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">http://www.becta.org.uk/</a>
 ), is providing computers to children aged 7-14 from low-income families. Launched this month, it
 aims to help around 270,000 families by March 2011.
</p>
<p> 
 The project does take extensive account of pupils with special
 access needs, with its basic package - computers, software,
 internet access and support - coming pre-loaded with a suite of
 assistive technology software, which includes literacy support
 tool Read and Write ; 'concept mapping' tool MindView 3; and
 magnification and speech tool iZoom.
</p>
<p> 
 To meet the assistive needs at home of pupils who have more
 severe visual impairments or other complex disabilities such as
 mobility issues or deafness, two further, more specialised
 packages are available. Package one - which includes a
 keyboard with larger keys and a large trackball mouse for those
 with limited motor skills - is also available from the outset.
</p>
<p> 
 However package two, a bespoke package to provide equipment
 for pupils who are blind, have cerebral palsy or severe mobility
 problems such as a touch-screen, a Braille keyboard or screen-
 reader software, is not yet available, and may not be for six
 months or more, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The delay is due to the original supplier tender being pulled
 following non-compliance with some of its terms, according to
 Mick Thomas, universal access manager at Becta. Thomas
 declined to supply details of the non-compliance, but said:
 &quot;We've discussed it with other suppliers and are looking to
 provide a service that's up and running before the end of the
 summer holiday.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Thomas says that as well as the obvious benefits to pupils of the
 assistive elements of Home Access, the programme's scale -
 thought to be the largest ever provision of assistive technology in
 the world - will help bring assistive technology further into the
 public eye. &quot;We've got a package that will overcome physical
 access issues for a whole bunch of people, and once we get the
 final piece of the jigsaw in place, it will be an amazing
 opportunity. A lot of the software and hardware traditionally
 thought of as being very niche is going to become more
 mainstream. I've worked in the assistive field for many years,
 and this is the opportunity we've been waiting for,&quot; he said.

<h3 id="i121-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Global Copyright Treaty On Access Formats Edges Closer.</h3>
<p> 
 An international treaty allowing people to share accessible
 versions of copyright works across national borders moved a
 step closer last month, with an agreement by the World
 Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to consult on the
 issue.
</p>
<p> 
 The 19th session of the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright
 and Related Rights (SCCR), held in Geneva in December (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/cHnS2R">http://bit.ly/cHnS2R</a>
 ), agreed to host a series of consultation meetings aimed at producing an international consensus.
</p>
<p> 
 The move builds on a formal proposal for a treaty on copyright
 exceptions and limitations from the World Blind Union, backed
 by WIPO member states Brazil, Ecuador and Paraguay earlier in
 2009 and endorsed in December by others including the US.
</p>
<p> 
 For many years, disability organisations have protested against a
 frequent inability to produce accessible versions of copyright
 works, since this is viewed by many legal systems as the
 production of an illegal copy. Last year Amazon, the maker of
 the Kindle electronic book reader, disabled the reader's text-to-
 speech function after publishers protested that accessible speech
 amounted to the creation of a new and unlawful audio copy (see
 E-Access Bulletin, March 2009:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ). Exchange of accessible works across borders is doubly hard, as the law varies
 between countries and where there is a grey area, few are willing
 to risk taking any action.
</p>
<p> 
 Cynthia Waddell, Executive Director of The International Center
 for Disability Resources on the Internet ( <a href="http://www.icdri.org">http://www.icdri.org</a>
 ), told E-Access Bulletin this month: &quot;One of the main issues for
 the proposed treaty is to address the book famine of accessible
 works.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;At this time, it is estimated that 95% of printed works are not
 available in accessible formats. One goal of the proposed treaty
 is to reduce the cost redundancies for the creation of accessible
 works and to remove the barriers to exporting and importing
 accessible works. For example, copyright restrictions on the
 internationally-bestselling Harry Potter novels mean copies
 translated into accessible formats cannot be shared across
 national lines, but must be retranslated in every country.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The WIPO committee undertook to circulate a questionnaire on
 national views and laws on copyright exceptions to member
 states, for replies by May 10, 2010. The committee will also
 gather examples of accessibility practices and solutions across
 member states. Results will be presented to the 20th session of
 the SCCR, set for June 2010.

<h3 id="i121-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Amazon Bows To Pressure On Kindle Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 The online retailer Amazon.com is to incorporate extra
 accessibility features into its Kindle DX electronic book reader
 or 'e-reader', after several American universities rejected the
 device as a potential teaching-aid, citing inaccessibility to blind
 students (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 119:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=357">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=357</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Audible menus and an extra-large font size will be added to the
 new version of the Kindle DX on its release this summer. The
 menu feature addresses claims by Syracuse and Wisconsin-
 Madison universities that although the Kindle features a text-to-
 speech function valuable for blind users, inaccessible menus
 meant that such users would not be able to activate the function.
</p>
<p> 
 In a related development, one US university that did use the
 Kindle in a pilot programme reached a settlement earlier this
 month in a lawsuit filed by the US National Federation of the
 Blind (NFB) and the American Council of the Blind (ACB).
</p>
<p> 
 Arizona State University was one of several universities to pilot
 the Kindle, all of which were due to give feedback to
 Amazon.com to assist with the device's development. However
 the NFB and ACB alleged that as the Kindle was not fully
 accessible to blind students, its use in the university, even in a
 pilot, violated federal law.
</p>
<p> 
 Amazon's new plans to make the Kindle more accessible have
 emerged as a factor in the Arizona settlement, as was a
 commitment by the university to provide students with
 accessible e-book readers over the coming years.
</p>
<p> 
 In a statement, NFB President Marc Maurer said his organisation
 was &quot;pleased with this settlement, which we believe will help to
 ensure that new technologies create new opportunities for blind
 students rather than new barriers.&quot;

<p>  Almost eight million UK adults have sensory impairments or other health problems which could make
 it difficult for them to access websites, according to a study by
 YouGov on behalf of disability employment charity Shaw Trust.
 The charity urged public sector bodies in particular to review
 their website accessibility in light of the Central Office of
 Information's 'Delivering inclusive websites' report, which set
 out minimum accessibility requirements for all public sector
 websites from December 2009:

<p>  Levels of compliance with web accessibility guidelines &quot;remain very low&quot; in EU member states, a new study

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: The Biggest It Help Scheme In The World.By Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 A government scheme to ensure all school pupils in England
 have access to computers and the internet at home could have a
 huge impact on the assistive technology sector.
</p>
<p> 
 Earlier this month, the government announced the launch of its
 'Home Access' scheme to improve technology access for school
 pupils from lower-income families. Backed by some Â&pound;300
 million, the scheme is expected to provide computers and
 internet access for home use to around 270,000 families by
 March 2011.
</p>
<p> 
 Aimed at children in years 3-9 (ages 7-14) of state education in
 England, the scheme offers grants to low-income families,
 means-tested to establish eligibility, allowing them to purchase
 Home Access packages from selected suppliers. The packages
 consist of a computer, a year's internet access, installed 'office
 productivity suite' software, and service and support for a year.
</p>
<p> 
 A pilot scheme run in Oldham and Suffolk during December last
 year proved successful, and roll-out across England is now
 taking place. The project is being managed by Becta (
 <a href="http://www.becta.org.uk/">http://www.becta.org.uk/</a>
 ), the government's agency for information and communications technology in education.
</p>
<p> 
 So far, so good. But what provisions are made for pupils with
 disabilities?
</p>
<p> 
 According to the programme's website (
 <a href="http://www.homeaccess.org.uk/">http://www.homeaccess.org.uk/</a>
 ), all packages come pre-loaded with a suite of assistive technology software, which includes
 Read and Write Home Access Edition (a literacy support
 package); MindView 3 (a 'concept mapping' programme to help
 pupils visualise and solve problems); and iZoom (a
 magnification and speech tool). The inclusion of these features
 within the basic package - expected to reach 270,000 families -
 makes the project what is thought to be the largest ever provision
 of assistive technology in the world.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Read and Write' and 'MindView' tools are aimed primarily
 at children with a range of learning difficulties such as dyslexia,
 while the 'iZoom' magnifier assists pupils with visual
 impairments. However, iZoom is only adequate to cope with the
 milder end of visual impairment. To meet the assistive needs at
 home of pupils who are blind, have severe visual impairment or
 other complex disabilities such as mobility issues or deafness,
 two further, more specialised packages are available.
</p>
<p> 
 Package one, supplied by assistive technology company
 Keytools, will be given out when requested by either the child or
 their parents. It contains a 'BigKeys' keyboard with larger keys
 and lettering, for mild visual impairments; a lightweight mini
 keyboard, allowing easier use by those in wheelchairs, for
 example; a large trackball mouse for those with limited motor
 skills; and high visibility stickers, again designed for visual
 impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 Package two is a bespoke package to provide equipment
 enabling internet access for pupils with specialist needs not
 covered by the basic package or package one. This may include,
 for example, pupils who are blind, have cerebral palsy or severe
 mobility problems.
</p>
<p> 
 It is the distribution of this second package which is likely to
 present the biggest accessibility challenges for the Home Access
 programme. Provision of equipment will be based on an
 individual assessment of the pupil's needs, which are to be
 gauged by talking to the pupil, his or her parents and the school.
</p>
<p> 
 Mick Thomas, universal access manager at Becta, told E-Access
 Bulletin that this process is likely to take place remotely. &quot;It
 doesn't preclude a face-to-face assessment, but my guess is that
 in 90% of the cases it will be remote.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 As for the equipment provided after needs are assessed, Thomas
 said: &quot;in theory it won't exclude anything but in reality - and this
 was born out from the pilot scheme - the package is likely to be
 accessed more by people who have severe visual problems and
 people who are blind.&quot; People with these visual impairments
 might receive, for example, a larger screen, a touch-screen, a
 Braille keyboard or screen-reader software, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, though the national rollout of funding and provision
 of the basic Home Access package and package one began
 earlier this month, package two - catering for more complex
 needs - is not yet available, and may not be for six months or
 more. &quot;Our original objective was to get it running in late April
 or early May,&quot; says Thomas. However, this date has now been
 moved back, due to the original supplier tender being pulled.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite this setback, the process is continuing, albeit at a slower
 rate than planned, Thomas said. &quot;The procurement is going
 ahead, but we're looking at doing it in a different way. In the
 original procurement there was non-compliance from a couple
 of the suppliers. We've discussed it with other suppliers and are
 looking to provide a service that's up and running before the end
 of the summer holiday.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The task is a considerable one for a sector that is still emerging
 into the mainstream, according to Ian Litterick, founder of
 educational assistive technology specialists iansyst (
 <a href="http://www.iansyst.co.uk/">http://www.iansyst.co.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
  &quot;For the assistive technology industry, it's quite a challenge to
 produce what is thought to be around 11,000 systems on a very
 short timescale,&quot; Litterick told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Litterick was generally positive about the Home Access scheme.
 He said it should cater adequately for pupils with a range of
 learning difficulties, including blind and visually impaired
 students, through provision of screen-reader software and other
 tools. However, he raised concerns over the level support
 offered: &quot;There's still a training need which at the moment isn't
 met under the Home Access funding, but my guess is that, in
 many cases, if you were a blind student you'll be prescribed
 what you've already been using in school. But there is still
 potentially a big need for training there.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Another potential concern is a lack of information about
 package two or any fixed date for its roll-out, with the result that
 pupils with more complex needs must wait at least four months
 for their assessments, Litterick said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It's been done in a huge hurry, to extremely tight deadlines, and
 not every decision along the way has been optimal, but broadly
 speaking I think it is a very exciting project&quot; he said. &quot;They've
 addressed the inclusion issue, as far as technology is concerned,
 in a pretty comprehensive and broadly admirable way.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Mick Thomas of Becta says that as well as the obvious benefits
 to pupils of the assistive elements of Home Access, the scale of
 provision will help bring assistive technology further into the
 public eye. &quot;We've got a package that will overcome physical
 access issues for a whole bunch of people, and once we get the
 final piece of the jigsaw in place, it will be an amazing
 opportunity. A lot of the software and hardware traditionally
 thought of as being very niche is going to become more
 mainstream. I've worked in the assistive field for many years,
 and this is the opportunity we've been waiting for,&quot; he said.
