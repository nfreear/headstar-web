<p>  EU Set To Ditch Rules On Accessible Goods.</p>
<p> 
 The European Union looks set to backtrack on proposed
 legislation that would have required accessibility to disabled
 people of all manufactured consumer goods, from digital
 televisions to washing machines, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned.
</p>
<p> 
 A Brussels meeting this week is expected to confirm changes to
 the draft Equal Treatment Directive (ETD), first proposed by
 the European Commission in 2008 to ban discrimination in
 access to goods and services, as set out in its full title: Proposal
 for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal
 treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief,
 disability, age or sexual orientation
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/9IFqXc">http://bit.ly/9IFqXc</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 In its original form, the directive would have required that all
 devices should be accessible, and for example could not be
 controlled solely by touch-screen controls or visual displays
 inaccessible to blind people.
</p>
<p> 
 Since 2008, however, member states have amended the text to
 remove any specific requirement. Article 4, point 3 in the latest
 set of amendments (available in pdf only at <a href="http://bit.ly/anrdqs">http://bit.ly/anrdqs</a>

 ) says:&quot;This Directive shall not apply to the design and
 manufacture of goods&quot;. The new version says simply that
 member states should take into account &quot;measures to ensure
 accessibility for persons with disabilities . [and] promote the
 research and development of universally designed goods,
 promote their availability and use, and promote universal
 design in the development of standards and guidelines.&quot;
 However, details of what forms such action should take are not
 specified.
</p>
<p> 
 The new version to be discussed in Brussels is supported by a
 majority of EU member states including the UK. A small
 number of states, including Austria, have spoken out against
 the reduced proposals however, and for the directive to
 become law, unanimous agreement will have to be reached.
</p>
<p> 
 Carine Marzin, European campaigns officer at the Royal
 National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), told E-Access
 Bulletin that continued reliance on the goodwill of
 manufacturers to deliver accessible manufactured goods to the
 market will not solve the problem. &quot;In practice, nothing will
 change if member states are not willing to address this issue
 through legislation,&quot; Marzin said. &quot;This is a unique opportunity
 to end the discrimination that many disabled people experience
 when trying to access goods, an opportunity that we can't
 afford to miss.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 For its part, the European Blind Union (EBU) says failure to
 implement the accessibility proposals as originally drafted
 could jeopardise trade with areas outside of Europe which may
 have more stringent rules in place (see EBU response in
 Microsoft Word format at:
 <a href="http://bit.ly/bowvGU">http://bit.ly/bowvGU</a>
 ). In the US, for example, a proposed law aims to force
 manufacturers to create accessible consumer technology
 products (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 122 -
 <a href="http://bit.ly/cRZVrs">http://bit.ly/cRZVrs</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 A joint campaign to oppose the UK's position on the ETD has
 now been launched by a group of UK disability charities:

<h3 id="i123-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Praise For Councils' Web Accessibility Progress.</h3>
<p> 
 UK local authority websites are &quot;much more accessible now
 than they've ever been&quot;, according to one specialist who
 worked on the recent 'Better Connected 2010' review of every
 local authority website in the UK conducted by the Society of
 IT Management (Socitm) (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/dltkU5">http://bit.ly/dltkU5</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Bim Egan, senior web access consultant at the Royal National
 Institute of Blind People (RNIB), told E-Access Bulletin the
 difference between council websites' accessibility this year
 compared with 2009 is &quot;astonishing&quot;. &quot;A much bigger
 proportion of [councils] are getting the message and are putting
 processes in place to make their websites a lot more
 accessible&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Egan's comments come despite the fact fewer local authority
 websites achieved formal compliance this year with Level A of
 the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version
 one (WCAG 1.0) - 32 compared to 36 in 2009. However, the
 RNIB ran its own additional assessment of &quot;functional
 accessibility&quot; which rated 187 councils (43%) as either
 'satisfactory' or 'excellent' compared with only 136 councils
 (33%) achieving the same levels last year.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite the progress, Egan said that over-reliance on PDFs
 (files in Adobe portable document format), which are often
 inaccessible to screen-readers and other forms of assistive
 technology, is still a significant accessibility problem for local
 authority sites.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It wouldn't matter as much if so many councils didn't rely so
 heavily on PDF format, but ... if it's not accessible, there could
 be situations where people can't even find out what their
 council tax is,&quot; Egan said.

 Connected 2010 see section three, this issue.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Technology Trust To Launch Online Hub For Socialgood.
</h3>
<p> 
 A new online knowledge centre for organisations working in
 the field of technology and social good is to be launched in
 June by the charity Nominet Trust, E-Access Bulletin has
 learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The trust (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/aXFbxD">http://bit.ly/aXFbxD</a>
 ), the UK's largest charitable fund for social IT projects, was set
 up with &pound;8 million from the UK's internet domain name
 registry Nominet to fund UK-based and international internet-
 related initiatives in the sectors of education, research and
 development, safety and inclusion meeting the needs of the
 young, the elderly, the disabled and sick, the disadvantaged,
 and other vulnerable groups.
</p>
<p> 
 Its new online network, set to launch in June, will include a
 monitoring centre tracking all its investments and allowing
 funded bodies to submit quarterly reports online; and a
 'knowledge centre' allowing groups to network. It aims to
 become the biggest hub for best practice sharing in its fields of
 funding, trust chairman Jonathan Welfare told E-Access
 Bulletin at last week's Digital Inclusion conference in London (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/aFvYk7">http://bit.ly/aFvYk7</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Nominet Trust has been investing since February 2009 with 36
 grants made to date, totalling &pound;1.9m. Its smallest grant so far
 has been &pound;1,000 to a primary school in Derbyshire to help
 produce a pamphlet on the potential dangers of the internet
 designed by its pupils and disseminated to other schools
 throughout the county by the education authority; and the
 largest has been &pound;0.5 million to the charity UnLtd ('unlimited')
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/cKD3Qy">http://bit.ly/cKD3Qy</a>
 ) which in turn funds smaller social IT projects across the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 One of the trust's first grants in April 2009 was made to the
 British Computer Association of the Blind (BCAB), to fund
 remote technical support people with impaired vision. Other
 funded groups include Screenreader.net, creator of free text-to-
 speech software 'Thunder'; ACE Centre Advisory Trust, for
 SpeechBubble, a comparison web site for disability
 communications aids; AbilityNet, for a project supporting
 accessible digital educational materials; and Citizens Online,
 for a project logging and fixing website accessibility problems.
</p>
<p> 
 Any group can apply for a grant at any time, with new funding
 decisions made quarterly.

 However, the decision will not receive legal backing unless
 supported by the Australian Human Rights Commission.
 Additionally, IT consultant Tom Worthington notes on his blog
 that the web page publicising the announcement itself fails to

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Special Report- Council Websites.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Better Than They Seem?By Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 At first glance, the accessibility results of this year's Society of
 IT Management (Socitm) 'Better Connected' review of all UK
 council websites ( <a href="http://bit.ly/dltkU5">http://bit.ly/dltkU5</a>
 ) would suggest that online access to local government for disabled computer users
 and others using assistive technology is still not a priority.
</p>
<p> 
 This year, for example, fewer local authorities achieved level
 'A' of the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
 version one (WCAG 1.0 <a href="http://bit.ly/cmbc4g">http://bit.ly/cmbc4g</a>
 ) than last year - 32 compared with 36 - and for the second year running, no
 council achieved the more stringent level 'AA'.
</p>
<p> 
 But appearances can be deceptive, and these figures do not tell
 the whole picture, according to Bim Egan, senior web access
 consultant at the Royal National Institute of Blind People
 (RNIB: <a href="http://bit.ly/a5Jz3i">http://bit.ly/a5Jz3i</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Egan, who carried out assessments for the Better Connected
 report, told E-Access Bulletin that websites which failed to
 achieve even the basic WCAG level 'A' standard, are not
 necessarily completely inaccessible to people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 WCAG is, by and large, a quantative assessment of various
 aspects of a site, whereas for the second year running, the
 RNIB also carried out additional qualitative assessments on
 council websites to achieve a wider picture of online
 accessibility. These checked for 'outcome' factors such as
 &quot;whether or not users could navigate, use and communicate
 with the site relatively easily if they had assistive technology
 needs or special needs&quot;, Egan says.
</p>
<p> 
 These tests used their own 0-3 rating system, with 0
 representing a frequent absence of accessibility and 3
 representing a site that was functionally fully accessible. Based
 on this system, 187 councils (43%) were rated by RNIB as
 satisfactory or excellent, compared with 136 councils (33%)
 last year.
</p>
<p> 
 This seems encouraging, but why is this not reflected in the
 WCAG 1.0-based system? &quot;We never believed that conformity
 tests were a real measure of accessibility&quot;, said Egan. &quot;It's not
 just what you do, it's how you do it, and conformity tests
 basically check for things like headings being used, and not
 how good [the websites] are.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Overall the findings suggest that council websites have
 improved their functional accessibility, says Egan, while
 sometimes embracing new technologies and techniques in such
 a way that conformity levels with standards have dropped.
</p>
<p> 
 So what are these new techniques that have hampered
 conformance to standards?
</p>
<p> 
 Not for the first time, JavaScript - a common programming
 language used in website pages - is one culprit. The use of
 JavaScript often leads to increased difficulty in navigating a
 webpage when using assistive technology or a keyboard, for
 example providing 'hidden' content that may not be picked up
 by some assistive technologies. Although JavaScript can
 sometimes actually be used to increase accessibility - by
 providing additional information to the user, for example - by
 and large, it is a recurring problem for accessibility
 conformance.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The main thing that affects conformity testing for WCAG 1.0
 is that a lot more sites are putting in a lot more functionality,
 and a lot of that functionality is reliant on JavaScript,&quot; says
 Egan. &quot;If we hadn't had JavaScript to check, we would have
 seen quite a considerable improvement in Level A
 conformance.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Egan also warns that should the Better Connected website
 review team adopt WCAG version 2.0 (the latest version of the
 guidelines) for its assessments next year, further changes will
 need to be made to ensure that basic standards are met. &quot;If
 we're looking at WCAG 2.0, the message is that councils are
 going to regret putting so much information into PDFs&quot;, she
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 PDFs (files in the Adobe 'portable document format', used
 widely by local councils and other public bodies) are often not
 fully accessible for screen-readers and other assistive
 technologies. There are ways of creating accessible PDFs using
 new versions of the format that can provide text tags for
 pictures, for example, but councils still tend to use the older
 inaccessible versions.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It wouldn't matter as much if so many councils didn't rely so
 heavily on PDF format,&quot; says Egan, &quot;but ...if [the PDF is] not
 accessible, there could be situations where people can't even
 find out what their council tax is.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Despite these concerns, Egan is keen to emphasise the increase
 in accessibility demonstrated by the RNIB's qualitative
 assessments. &quot;This is my fifth year of working on Better
 Connected and the difference is astonishing. Council websites
 are much more accessible now than they've ever been,&quot; she
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 Perhaps surprisingly, Egan also believes that stronger legislation
 is not the best way to achieve further improvements, preferring
 instead to champion those that are succeeding and encourage
 them to lead by example. &quot;I don't think more legislation is
 going to do it&quot; she says. &quot;We've had some pretty horrendous
 threats, like losing the '.gov.uk' domain, and I don't know
 what else can be done to encourage sites to become more
 accessible other than showing by example and rewarding and
 applauding the ones who do it right. Let's give more airtime to
 them, so that the people who've got it wrong and their councils
 are forced to do something about it.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 She urged those who have not achieved good accessibility
 ratings of any kind so far to rise to the challenge. &quot;Those
 websites who've not achieved WCAG 1.0 or got a rating of 1
 or 2 on our own [RNIB] rating system should not feel
 discouraged - I'd prefer that they felt challenged&quot;, says Egan.
 &quot;Accessibility isn't where you're at, it's the road you're
 following.&quot;
