<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i124-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Campaigning Peer Blocks Weakening Of Web Access Law.</h3>
<p> 
 A campaigning peer has ensured that the new Equality Act, an
 update of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), includes a
 commitment to online accessibility, by successfully moving
 an amendment as the law passed through the House of Lords.
</p>
<p> 
 Lord Low of Dalston, vice president and former chairman of
 the Royal National Institute of Blind People and himself
 blind, moved a change of wording to the Act to state that
 when providing information, organisations' processes should
 &quot;include steps for ensuring that. the information is provided
 in an accessible format.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The Act ( <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-">http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-</a>

 10/equality/documents.html ) passed into law last week after
 being rushed back through the Commons without a vote in
 the 'wash-up' period before this week's dissolution of
 Parliament for the General Election.
</p>
<p> 
 Lord Low said the change would allow for easier regulation
 by enforcement authorities such as the Equalities and Human
 Rights Commission (EHRC). The EHRC has separately
 released a draft code of practice on the law (
 <a href="http://bit.ly/aN8W5i">http://bit.ly/aN8W5i</a>
 ) which refers to website accessibility: &quot;As well as giving rise to an obligation to make a reasonable
 adjustment to their website, [failure to make a website
 accessible to those with visual impairments] will be unlawful
 (unless they can justify it).&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However, the Equality Act has been criticised for its complex
 language and ambiguity. Struan Robertson, a technology
 lawyer with Pinsent Masons and editor of legal news website
 Out-Law.com ( <a href="http://www.out-law.com/">http://www.out-law.com/</a>
 ), told E-Access Bulletin that parts of the new law are &quot;borderline
 impenetrable&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;For me, the biggest disappointment about the Equality Act is
 that for an act on accessibility, it's difficult to access,&quot; said
 Robertson. &quot;That's unfortunate, because one of the great
 things about the DDA was that it was easy to identify the
 duties that people were under&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Robertson said that although the new Equality Act as
 amended may provide clarification on web accessibility for
 some businesses, the law remains broadly the same as its
 predecessor, the DDA. &quot;The differences are quite subtle and
 it will not have a material impact on the state of accessibility
 of website across the UK,&quot; he said.

<h3 id="i124-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Us Government Helps Job Applicants With Disabilities.</h3>
<p> 
 The Obama administration is undertaking two major exercises
 to help people with disabilities apply for government jobs,
 delegates heard at last month's California State University
 Northridge (CSUN) Technologies and Persons with
 Disabilities Conference.
</p>
<p> 
 Employment was the central topic at CSUN, the largest
 assistive technology event in the world, this year celebrating
 its 25th anniversary. Less than a third of blind people of
 working age in the US have a job, delegates heard.
</p>
<p> 
 On 26 April, federal agencies will be interviewing an
 estimated 600 disabled people selected from around 4,000
 applicants to a special 'hiring fair' in Washington organised
 by the Office of Personnel Management and the Labor
 Department's Office of Disability Policy (
 <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/DisabilityHiringEvent.asp">http://www.usajobs.gov/DisabilityHiringEvent.asp</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The US government is also set to overhaul Section 508 of the
 country's Rehabilitation Act, the law that obliges federal
 agencies to buy accessible equipment for disabled employees
 including computers, photocopiers and telephones.
</p>
<p> 
 At CSUN the government held a public hearing at which
 delegates were able to respond to proposals to refresh Section
 508 to include newer technology such as mobile technology
 and electronic books. The overwhelming message was that
 change should come as quickly as possible. Further
 comments are invited by June 21:
 <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/news/ict-draft-rule.htm">http://www.access-board.gov/news/ict-draft-rule.htm</a>
 </p>
<p> 
 The Access Board also proposes to supplement its ADA
 Accessibility Guidelines, which cover access to facilities, to
 broaden coverage to include certain types of interactive
 transaction machines such as point-of-sale machines and self-
 service kiosks.
</p>

<h3 id="i124-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: E-Book Guide Highlights Benefits And Obstacles.</h3>
<p> 
 A guide to the accessibility benefits and obstacles of major
 electronic book formats, including technical formats, e-book
 readers and reader software, has been published by the Royal
 National Institute of Blind People (RNIB).
</p>
<p> 
 E-book readers covered by the document (
 <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/readingwriting/ebo">http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/readingwriting/ebo</a>

 oks/ ) include dedicated e-book readers; e-book reading
 software; and e-book readers for mobile phones.
</p>
<p> 
 Dedicated readers include the Amazon Kindle (benefits
 include text-to-speech; obstacles are that text-to-speech
 currently applies to book content only, though Amazon have
 announced it will have audible menus by mid-2010); plus the
 Bookeen Cybook Gen 3, Sony Pocket and Sony Touch
 (benefits of all three include various text size options;
 obstacles include no text-to-speech feature).
</p>
<p> 
 The guide also provides a list of retailers and websites from
 which e-books and readers can be purchased or downloaded.
</p>
<p> 
 E-books are becoming more widespread in public libraries
 around the UK, with many branches embracing the lending of
 digital books, a model already widely adopted in the US.
 According to a report in a recent issue of E-Access Bulletin's
 sister publication, E-Government Bulletin, the new breed of
 library will not only make an ever-wider range of research
 and searchable reference information available over the web
 to their users, but promote the temporary lending of electronic
 books of all kinds: <a href="http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=433">http://www.headstar.com/egblive/?p=433</a>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Conference ReportCSUN 2010, San Diego
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>Tby John Lamb.
</h3>
<p> 
 Gatherings of technologists always have an atmosphere of
 excitement about them whether it's generated by the thrill of
 discovering the next big thing or just catching up on the
 gossip about what's hot and what's not.
</p>
<p> 
 But there is an even more special buzz to the California State
 University Northridge (CSUN) Technologies and Persons with
 Disabilities Conference, the largest assistive technology event
 in the international calendar and this year celebrating its 25th
 anniversary.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 5,000 people thronged the massive towers of the
 Manchester Hyatt Hotel in San Diego at the end of March,
 many of them vision-impaired. Some 200 hotel staff had
 received special training in disability awareness from the
 university, not that those walking flat out across the lobby
 with a white cane in front of them looked as though they
 needed much help.
</p>
<p> 
 Harry Murphy was the man who started it all back in 1985.
 He was working with deaf students at the time. &quot;I kept getting
 questions such as 'what are you doing for students with
 learning disabilities, or what are you doing for students with
 computers?'&quot; he recalls.
</p>
<p> 
 Initially, Murphy envisaged a conference of 200 people from
 Southern California, but 600 turned up from around the
 world. &quot;It was like having a tiger by the tail: you can't stop
 swinging or it will bite you. We ended up occupying two
 hotels at Los Angeles airport.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The setting up of Northridge's own Center on Disability grew
 out of the event. &quot;People just kept asking what sort of
 technology we had in our university, so we raised $300,000
 to establish a computer contact center.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 This year's central topic was employment. The keynote
 speech was delivered by Captain Ivan Castro, the only
 serving blind person in the US Special Forces, who
 highlighted the fact that less than a third of blind people of
 working age in the US have a job, a situation that the feisty
 Dinah Cohen is keen to rectify.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The problems are huge but it isn't a hidden issue anymore.
 Best practice doesn't work; we are looking for next practice,&quot;
 said Cohen, who is director of the Computer and Electronic
 Accommodations Program (CAP).
</p>
<p> 
 Her organisation provides training and equipment to disabled
 federal employees and disabled service people. Over the past
 20 years CAP has provided assistive technology to over
 85,000 civil servants, including 14,000 wounded service
 personnel.
</p>
<p> 
 However, with disabled people representing a decreasing
 proportion of the government workforce, CAP is involved in
 educating federal officials on how to hire more of them. At
 the end of April, federal agencies will be interviewing 600
 disabled people in a single day for jobs.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;People want to see Federal Government walk the walk rather
 than just talking about it. People without evident disabilities
 are ignored, we want to breakdown the silos in government
 and work together,&quot; said Kathleen Martinez, Assistant
 Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy and
 another of the star speakers at this year's CSUN.
</p>
<p> 
 Martinez, who is blind, had just completed a six-city listening
 tour to gather information on barriers and best practices
 relating to the employment of people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 One lever in promoting disabled employment is Section 508,
 the law that obliges federal agencies to buy accessible
 equipment for disabled employees. The legislation requires
 suppliers to adapt office equipment such as computers,
 photocopiers and telephones.
</p>
<p> 
 At CSUN the legislators held a public hearing at which
 delegates were able to respond to proposals to refresh Section
 508. The US Access Board aims to update the legislation to
 include newer technology such as real time text, ATMs,
 mobile technology, electronic books, video and voice texts.
 The overwhelming message was that change should come as
 quickly as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 Not everyone was so keen, however. Book publishers are
 arguing for exemptions to Section 508 to preserve digital
 rights management to protect copyright, potentially preventing
 the creation of machine-readable copies of texts accessible by
 people with reading difficulties.
</p>
<p> 
 This is one issue that will go on generating excitement long
 after the Hyatt Hotel has put away its CSUN guide-dog water
 bowls for another year.
