<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Braille Struggles Under Threat From Audiotechnologies.
</h3>
<p> 
 The future of Braille is being threatened by the rise of digital
 audio technologies, but it continues to hold valuable potential
 to enhance the lives of blind people, according to an article in
 the Italian newspaper La Repubblica translated exclusively
 for this month's E-Access Bulletin by Margherita Giordano.
</p>
<p> 
 Braille could become a &quot;dead language&quot; as new technologies
 such as telephone services with synthetic voices to read
 newspapers; talking computers and audio-books mean the
 tactile alphabet is being used less and less, the article says.
 These days, only 25% of Italian people who are blind
 (362,000) and 10% of blind Americans (1,300,000) know
 Braille, compared with a figure in the US of more than half of
 all blind children in the 1950s, according to a recent issue of
 the New York Times.
</p>
<p> 
 Braille has been adapted for the computer age with an eight-
 dot version corresponding to the digital 'ASCII' screen
 characters, used in refreshable Braille displays that translate
 lines of text on a computer screen. However these displays
 remain very expensive and are not as popular among young
 people as text-to-speech tools, the article says. &quot;More
 prosaically, why should you read Harry Potter in 36 volumes
 when you can listen to it in MP3 format?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Braille's supporters, on the other hand, cite scientific studies
 that show the importance of reading in a child's cognitive
 development. They say it is a way to emancipate the blind,
 offering independent and unmediated access to knowledge.
</p>
<p> 
 The way forward could lie in a combination of languages and
 techniques: &quot;old and new, dots and bits&quot;, the article says.
</p>
<p> 
 Tommaso Daniele, Chairman of the Italian Union of the
 Blind (Unione Italiana Ciechi), told La Repubblica that new
 technologies have the power not to destroy Braille but to
 enhance it. &quot;We deny the assumption that they are
 competitive. The two . . . work together, they are
 complementary. Technology is revolutionising the lives and
 the autonomy of blind people, allowing them to surf the net
 and to read texts that would be too bulky and expensive if
 translated into Braille&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 But Braille has its unique strengths too, Daniele says. &quot;It is
 original, universal, it is a direct way to access
 communication...reading is slower, but allows a better
 learning process. It does not need any mediation&quot;.

<h3 id="i122-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Proposed Us Law Would Force Product Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Manufacturers and suppliers of consumer technology devices
 in the US could be forced to make all their products
 accessible to blind consumers, if proposed legislation is
 passed by Congress. 
</p>
<p> 
 Introduced by Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic House of
 Representatives member from Illinois, the Technology Bill of
 Rights for the Blind Act 2010 (
 <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4533/text">http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4533/text</a>
 ) is based around creating accessible alternatives to what it calls
 &quot;increasingly complex user interfaces&quot; found in consumer
 electronics.
</p>
<p> 
 Many of these devices, from televisions and dishwashers to
 office equipment such as photocopiers and fax machines, are
 operated by touch-screen technology or other visual displays
 that are not accessible to blind people, the bill says. &quot;This
 growing threat to the independence and productivity of blind
 people is unnecessary because electronic devices can easily
 be constructed with user interfaces that are not exclusively
 visual&quot;, it says.
</p>
<p> 
 The draft law builds on guidelines set out in Section 508 of
 the Rehabilitation Act, which requires US Government bodies
 to engage in accessible IT and electronics procurement ( See:
 <a href="http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The bill is divided into three parts: first, to commission study
 to determine non-visual control methods for consumer
 electronics; second, to create a set of &quot;minimum non-visual
 access standards&quot; to which devices should conform; and
 third, to establish an &quot;office of non-visual access
 compliance&quot; to carry out the study and enforce the access
 standards.
</p>
<p> 
 Peter Abrahams, accessibility and usability practice leader at
 IT research organisation Bloor Research (
 <a href="http://www.bloorresearch.com/">http://www.bloorresearch.com/</a>
 ), told E-Access Bulletin that as well as being a significant step for accessible
 manufacturing of consumer electronics, the bill could, in
 theory, also be used to enforce website accessibility. &quot;I can
 imagine you could say that [a website] is the interface to a
 product or service, and therefore it has to be accessible and
 be covered by the same bill. My view is that in the future it
 could be used to push [the web accessibility] agenda as well.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However, it may take some time for manufacturers and
 website owners to be affected by the technology bill, even if
 it is passed, warned Abrahams. The bill needs to pass both
 houses of the Congress by a majority vote, before being
 examined and signed by President Obama. This process,
 combined with setting up the office of non-visual access
 compliance and carrying out the study and report as set out in
 the bill, means it could be several years before the proposed
 legislation comes into effect.

<h3 id="i122-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Researchers Plan To Automate Web Image Description.</h3>
<p> 
 Groundbreaking work to try to enable computers to describe
 visual content on web pages begun this month with the
 formation of a new UK academic research network. 
</p>
<p> 
 The network is aiming to develop a web browser plug-in
 which would be able to analyse an image and describe it to a
 visually impaired user. It is one of a number of projects
 exploring computer vision and computer language
 programming to be undertaken by the new V&amp;L Net (
 <a href="http://www.vlnet.org.uk/">http://www.vlnet.org.uk/</a>
 ) - the Vision and Language Network of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
 Council (EPSRC).
</p>
<p> 
 The network, which will run for three years, is co-ordinated
 by Dr Anja Belz from The University of Brighton. She told E-
 Access Bulletin that it was important to improve web
 accessibility from the user side, as many site owners still
 ignore legal requirements to deliver accessible pages. &quot;We're
 looking at developing a general purpose tool which would
 give visually impaired internet users some degree of access to
 any visual information that's out there.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The project is thought to be the first of its kind and the
 completed tool would make a significant improvement on
 current accessible web browsers or extensions to traditional
 screen-readers that try to make sense of an image file name,
 Belz said. However, she said it is likely to be many years
 before image description capability is achieved to satisfactory
 quality and the tool is made available.
</p>
<p> 
 Other V&amp;L Net projects to assist the visually impaired include
 a tool that describes the colour and pattern of an object (an
 extension to current 'colour teller' software), which could be
 available in the next five to 10 years; and a product label
 reader which scans information on packaging, such as food
 labels, and reads it to the user, a task currently difficult to
 achieve with standard optical character recognition
 technology unless the product is completely flat.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: The Decline Of Braille: Doomsday For The Dots?</h3>
<p> 
 by Alessandra Retico
</p>
<p> 
 They are letters you can touch: six little dots you brush with
 your fingers, 64 combinations to encode the world. But now
 Braille, the blind person's Esperanto, is set to become a dead
 language.
</p>
<p> 
 New technologies mean the tactile alphabet is being used less
 and less, as sound takes its place: technologies such as
 telephone services with synthetic voices to read newspapers;
 talking computers and audio-books. Many young blind
 people no longer learn the physical grammar that would allow
 them to communicate with any other user in any language,
 preferring to put on their headphones. These days, only 25%
 of Italian people who are blind (362,000) and 10% of blind
 Americans (1,300,000) know Braille (compared with a figure
 in the US of more than half of all blind children in the 1950s,
 according to a recent issue of the New York Times). Invented
 in 1829 by Louis Braille, who became blind at the age of six
 and inspired by a military code for the transmission of
 messages at night, the system still survives, but faces strong
 competition from information technology.
</p>
<p> 
 So, is it goodbye? Not quite, but the six dots that, for more
 than 180 years, have translated letters, musical notes,
 numbers and chemical formulas, are no longer enough. The
 old Braille has added more signs to conform to the language
 of the web: eight dots instead of six and 256 combinations in
 all, to allow blind people to read web pages. The translation
 from video screen to fingertips takes place by means of a
 refreshable Braille display, translating the words and icons
 appearing on the screen into relief text using tiny pins rising
 and falling, running information into a line of 20 to 80
 characters.
</p>
<p> 
 Enhanced and enriched, this is the Braille of the internet age.
 But it is still very expensive, and not very popular: even if the
 National Health Service delivers these displays for free,
 young people prefer to use their ears to connect to the web. 
</p>
<p> 
 This is the era of sound. Marshall McLuhan argued that
 technology would bring Western culture back to a tribal and
 oral state: the decline of the world of writing would give birth
 to a post-literate generation. From the beginning, Braille has
 had its detractors, who considered it an arcane and marginal
 form of communication, a segregational code. Others have
 supported it as a way to emancipate the blind, offering
 independent and unmediated access to knowledge. But today,
 more prosaically, why should you read Harry Potter in 36
 volumes when you can listen to it in MP3 format?
</p>
<p> 
 Should we worry? Braille's supporters cite many scientific
 studies that show the importance of reading in a child's
 cognitive development. For them, casting writing aside would
 be like returning to pre-Gutenberg times, when culture was in
 the hands of intellectuals and churchmen. But others argue
 that after all, we have only been reading for 6,000 years and
 mass literacy is a relatively recent phenomenon. The way
 forward could lie in a combination of languages: old and
 new, dots and bits.
</p>
<p> 
 Tommaso Daniele, Chairman of the Italian Union of the
 Blind (Unione Italiana Ciechi), is among the supporters of the
 old reading system and has been struggling for many years to
 promote it, especially in schools. He argues that new
 technologies have not set Braille aside - if anything, they
 have enhanced it.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We deny the assumption that they are competitive. The two .
 . . work together, they are complementary. Technology is
 revolutionising the lives and the autonomy of blind people,
 allowing them to surf the net and to read texts that would be
 too bulky and expensive if translated into Braille&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 But Braille has its unique strengths too, Daniele says. &quot;It is
 original, universal, it is a direct way to access communication.
 It originated from a brilliant idea, which made it accessible to
 everybody. And it is very useful for training: reading is
 slower, but allows a better learning process. According to the
 Italian writer Camilleri, it is the only language that you can
 touch with your fingers. It does not need any mediation&quot;.
