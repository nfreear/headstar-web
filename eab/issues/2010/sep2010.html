<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01:  Volunteer Pool To 'Crowd-Source' Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 An online service helping web users with disabilities report
 accessibility problems by linking them with thousands of tech-
 savvy volunteers is to be launched later this year by digital
 inclusion charity Citizens Online.
</p>
<p> 
 A trial version of 'Fix the Web', sub-titled 'crowd-sourcing e-
 accessibility', was unveiled at this week's Web Accessibility
 London Unconference 2010 by Dr Gail Bradbrook, the
 charity's lead consulant.
</p>
<p> 
 Web users will be able to report accessibility problems directly
 to the service using Twitter, email or online forms. Members of
 a pool of registered volunteers will then take responsibility for
 finding the correct official path or website owner contact to
 lodge the complaint on the user's behalf, follow up any
 response and feed back to the user.
</p>
<p> 
 The project's initial goal is to sign up 10,000 volunteers to
 cover 250,000 websites a year, Bradbrook said. Eventually she
 hopes to sign up 1.5 million volunteers worldwide.
</p>
<p> 
 Research has found that people with disabilities face many
 access issues, but do not often complain about them,
 Bradbrook said. &quot;This isn't surprising - if so much of your
 time has already been wasted, why would you spend further
 time trying to communicate with the website owner?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Benefits of making it easier for people to complain could
 include greater pressure for accessibility; feedback that website
 owners can work with or use to justify changes; and increased
 knowledge and skills for volunteers, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Generally, volunteers would simply be raising awareness of
 accessibility issues, but if some major companies repeatedly
 ignored requests for help the project might consider working
 with campaign groups to lobby for action, Bradbrook said.
</p>
<p> 
 One business manager present welcomed the project, saying it
 could save firms like his money by providing valuable user
 feedback. &quot;We want to make our websites as accessible as
 possible to everyone, so we would put your link on all of our
 sites, and I don't see why anyone else wouldn't,&quot; he said.
 However, a web developer delegate said he was worried that
 unfounded complaints passed on by volunteers with
 insufficient technical understanding could be used to criticise
 web developers unfairly.
</p>
<p> 
 In response, Bradbrook said volunteers would be given
 guidance, and the project would be monitored for potential
 problems. &quot;We are not asking them to be experts in e-
 accessibility - just to go to the website and log the problem
 formally. We hope it will open up communication which can
 be carried on by the volunteer so that proper understanding can
 be reached.&quot;

<h3 id="i129-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Kindle 3:</h3>
<p>  Better Accessibility, But Still Not Perfect.</p>
<p> 
 Improved accessibility features on the new Kindle 3 electronic
 book reader will help vision-impaired users, but do not yet go
 far enough to make the device fully accessible, a leading
 analyst said this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The Kindle 3, developed by the online retailer Amazon,
 features a display with improved contrast and an audible menu
 facility, 'Voice Guide', enabling users to select an e-book using
 sound and activate the device's text-to-speech 'Read to Me'
 feature. The Kindle 3 also features a display with 50%
 improved contrast between the text and background, improving
 the readability of text for partially sighted users.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The Voice Guide does improve the accessibility of the device
 significantly&quot;, RNIB Principal Manager of Digital Accessibility
 Robin Spinks told E-Access Bulletin.
 &quot;However, certain functions are not yet possible, for example,
 being able to browse the electronic bookstore using text-to-
 speech and being able to select, purchase and download book
 content from the device [using Voice Guide], rather than
 having to do that from a computer.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Amazon's decision to incorporate audible menus follows
 growing pressure over the past year about the device's
 inaccessibility to visually impaired users, much of which arose
 after several US universities rejected the Kindle as a teaching
 aid (see E-Access Bulletin issue 119:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=357">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=357</a>
 ). In January, Amazon agreed to incorporate audible menus and an extra-
 large font size into the Kindle (see E-Access Bulletin issue 121:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=383">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=383</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Furthermore, some publishers are still refusing to allow their
 books to be converted into text-to-speech on the Kindle, due to
 an ongoing row over publishing rights
 (see E-Access Bulletin issue 110:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ). &quot;We hope that through the ongoing campaign work that RNIB
 and other organisations are engaged in globally, we will be able
 to secure universal availability of text-to-speech on e-books&quot;
 said Spinks. &quot;It's vital that blind and partially sighted people
 are able to be part of the e-book revolution.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The Kindle 3 is available now in the UK. The RNIB has
 published a detailed accessibility review of the device and
 other e-book readers on its website:

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Inclusive Island 'Discovered' In Second Life.</h3>
<p> 
 A new island themed around disability and inclusion has been
 'discovered' in Second Life, by the man whose online
 character or 'avatar' was the first to use a wheelchair in the
 virtual world.
</p>
<p> 
 Llamdos (try reading the name backwards) was created by
 Simon Stevens, a consultant who in 2006 created Wheelies, the
 first virtual night-club in Second Life aimed at both disabled
 and non-disabled users.
</p>
<p> 
 The island, which Stevens estimates has already received more
 than 10,000 visitors from around 30 countries, is now home to
 Wheelies plus a range of virtual shops and services such as the
 Understand training centre and Viewpoint conference centre,
 where Stevens organises and hosts workshops and seminars on
 a wide range of issues in the fields of disability and social care.
</p>
<p> 
 Stevens told E-Access Bulletin that although Llamdos has the
 themes of disability and inclusion, the island is not solely &quot;for
 disabled people, and is intended to be a place for both disabled
 and non-disabled Second Life users&quot;. Although Llamdos is
 &quot;probably not as technically accessible as it can be&quot;, he said
 &quot;many organisations have become too obsessed with the rules
 of [accessibility] and they have forgotten the spirit of the
 intentions. My aim is for the island to feel inclusive and
 welcoming.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 A number of communities in Second Life now explore themes
 of disability, such as Ability Island, a training and discussion
 area owned by US organisation Virtual Ability. Virtual Ability
 also own Cape Able Island, designed primarily for deaf and
 hard of hearing Second Life users.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Event Report- Web Accessibility Unconference.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Open For Access.</h3>
<p> 
 Delegates at this month's 'Web Accessibility London
 Unconference 2010' ( <a href="http://www.a11yldn.org.uk">http://www.a11yldn.org.uk</a>
 ) were treated to a run-through of the state-of-the-art for open source
 accessibility solutions by one of the world's leading experts in
 the field.
</p>
<p> 
 Steve Lee, of consultancy Full Measure (
 <a href="http://www.fullmeasure.co.uk">http://www.fullmeasure.co.uk</a>
 ), is the driving force behind many open source accessibility projects including several of
 those gathered under the umbrella of 'OSS Watch' (
 <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/">http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/</a>
 ), a free public service to help higher and further education institutions in the UK use or
 develop free and open source software. It is funded by higher
 education IT support agency JISC.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There are some very strong potential benefits of open
 technology for users with disabilities,&quot; said Lee. These
 included making it easier for developers to create new tools
 and innovations, by working with what is already there; the
 creation of shared resources; and greater user engagement in
 the creation of new technologies, he said. &quot;With open
 standards, the users are the developers.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Projects highlighted by Lee included:
</p>
<p> 
 - AccessApps
 <a href="http://www.techdis.ac.uk/getaccessapps">http://www.techdis.ac.uk/getaccessapps</a>
 AccessApps is an initiative supported by JISC TechDis, the
 accessibility advisory arm of JISC. It consists of more than 50
 open source and freeware Windows applications, running from
 a USB stick, to support writing, reading and planning for
 students with sensory, cognitive and physical difficulties;
</p>
<p> 
 - Simon Listens
 <a href="http://www.simon-listens.org">http://www.simon-listens.org</a>
 An open source speech-recognition programme, allowing users
 to control the computer by voice alone, bypassing mouse and
 keyboard;
</p>
<p> 
 - NVDA
 <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">http://www.nvda-project.org/</a>
 NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free, open source
 screen reader for Windows. It supports more than 20 languages
 and has the ability to run entirely from a USB drive, with no
 installation;
</p>
<p> 
 - Opengazer
 <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer</a>
 Opengazer is an open source eye-tracking application that uses
 an ordinary webcam to estimate the direction of your gaze.
 This information can then be passed to other applications. For
 example, used in conjunction with the smartphone app Dasher,
 Opengazer allows you to write with your eyes;
</p>
<p> 
 - GOK (GNOME on-screen keyboard)
 <a href="http://www.gok.ca/">http://www.gok.ca/</a>
 Free software working with GNOME, the popular GNU/Linux
 desktop environment, that provides text entry and graphical
 user interface interaction using only switches or mice;
</p>
<p> 
 - Caribou
 <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Caribou">http://live.gnome.org/Caribou</a>
 Another on-screen keyboard application for use with switches;
</p>
<p> 
 - Straight-Street
 <a href="http://straight-street.com">http://straight-street.com</a>
 An open symbol set known as 'Mulberry' - a free, scalable
 collection of about 800 picture symbols, and growing - 3,000
 are promised by this time next year. Symbols like these are
 very useful for clear communication, particularly for use with
 solutions aimed at those with literacy issues like dyslexia or
 learning difficulties;
</p>
<p> 
 - Maavis
 <a href="http://maavis.fullmeasure.co.uk">http://maavis.fullmeasure.co.uk</a>
 Project from Sheffield University and Barnsley NHS offering
 simple access to a range of tasks and games such as viewing
 photographs and making skype video calls, for older people
 including people with dementia. Applications, images and
 information are accessed by touching the screen and the
 interface is so simple and intuitive that users are not aware they
 are using a computer, Lee said. Buttons are also spoken aloud
 when pressed.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, the key to developing successful open source
 solutions is the creation of a vibrant developer community, and
 the commitment of as many users as possible to helping with
 development, Lee said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;A lot of people latch onto open source software and say 'free
 stuff - great'. And there are some things that are just free to
 download and that's it, no community.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;But where there are communities, it is always better if you
 engage with them, try and contribute something - it could be a
 graphic, it could be some help text for the online manual. And
 if you are a programmer, you could contribute code - or fix
 something - that will get you a lot of brownie points.&quot;
