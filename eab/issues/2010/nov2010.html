<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Cautious Welcome For Copyright Law Change Timetable.</h3>
<p>  
 The RNIB has given a cautious welcome to a World Intellectual
 Property Organisation decision to agree a timetable for creation
 of a new international law allowing sharing of accessible
 versions of copyright works across national borders.
</p>
<p>  
 If passed, the law would require the introduction of exceptions
 in the national legislation of all member states, so that print-
 disabled people, including blind people, people with impaired
 vision and people with dyslexia, can make accessible copies of
 copyright works and share them across international
 boundaries.
</p>
<p>  
 The decision is the latest twist in a three-year process of
 debating whether, how and when a new law could be agreed. A
 treaty on copyright exceptions and limitations was first
 proposed by the World Blind Union in 2008. It was backed in
 2009 by WIPO member states Brazil, Ecuador and Paraguay,
 later joined by Mexico and supported by the US, the UK and
 others.
</p>
<p>  
 In December 2009 the nineteenth session of the WIPO
 Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR)
 agreed to hold a series of consultation meetings on the issue.
 But in June 2010, the committee’s twentieth session finished
 deadlocked on the best way to proceed further. Some
 countries, including some EU member states, raised objections
 to any exception to copyright law that could allow free copying
 under any circumstances, after lobbying by publishers and
 copyright holders who feared a precedent would be created
 that could encourage copyright piracy.
</p>
<p>  
 After a further week of debate, the 21st session of SCCR
 finished in Geneva at 1am last Saturday morning with the
 agreement of a timetable for progress towards a legal
 instrument.
</p>
<p>  
 The timetable allows for work on copyright exceptions for
 accessible copies to continue at the 22nd five-day session in
 June 2011, with three extra days set aside for specific
 discussion of the issue. A recommendation will then be put
 forward to the WIPO general assembly in Sept 2011.
</p>
<p>  
 Other related issues, including calls by African countries for
 similar exceptions to be made for libraries, archives and
 educational bodies, will be considered later in 2011 and in
 2012.
</p>
<p>  
 RNIB Campaign Manager Dan Pescod, who has attended the
 Geneva meetings as part of a World Blind Union delegation,
 said progress in the committees had been “glacially slow”, but
 that “to paraphrase Winston Churchill, this is not the beginning
 of the end, but the end of the beginning.
</p>
<p>  
 “We have fought for a long time to get this issue understood in
 the committee, and then to get all parties to agree that some
 kind of law needs to be drafted, and now to put together a
 timetable about when we are going to negotiate. Now we have
 that on the record so we know they are serious.”
</p>
<p>  
 However, Pescod warned that the battle was not yet over, and
 the process could yet hit further delays. “We are very pleased
 with where we have got to, but I do have a strong concern [the
 extra three days] won’t be enough time.”
</p>
<p>  
 On the objections raised by some countries to the passing of a
 law, he said fears that they would lead to losses for publishers
 were groundless because bodies like the RNIB would only step
 in to make accessible copies such as audio books where the
 publishers themselves had not done so.
</p>
<p>  
 “The publisher loses nothing. If they have made their own
 unabridged audio version, RNIB would not want to bother –
 and where they have not, they were not going to make any
 money from it in any case. The exception is there to fall back
 on where market has not supplied an accessible version.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Mp’S Website Wins Award, But Majority Inaccessible.</h3>
<p>  
 The website of Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne East and
 former Cabinet minister Nick Brown has won the accessibility
 category in the 2010 MP Web Awards, hosted by BCS – the
 Chartered Institute for IT (formerly known as the British
 Computer Society).
</p>
<p>  
 The awards are presented to politicians who best use new
 technologies to engage with their constituents. The accessibility
 award was judged by representatives of technology charity
 AbilityNet, who reported a number of features that caused
 Brown’s website ( <a href="http://www.nickbrownmp.com/">http://www.nickbrownmp.com/</a>
 ) to stand out, including no unlabelled images; a good default
 size for text, which can be resized; no distracting or moving
 images; keyboard access for the whole site; and no issues when
 using a screen-reader.
</p>
<p>  
 The panel also found some minor areas in which accessibility
 could be further improved on Brown’s site: inclusion of ‘skip’
 links for keyboard users; ensuring that all title text matches the
 actual link text; and providing a button to activate the site
 search function. However judges said the site as a whole was
 “a clear and consistent website that follows best practices for
 accessibility.”
</p>
<p>  
 Robin Christopherson, head of digital inclusion at AbilityNet
 and presenter of the accessibility award, told E-Access Bulletin
 that although Brown’s website was the best example of
 accessibility from the 600 plus sites examined, there is still
 room for improvement across the board. “Most MPs’ websites
 out there reflect the overall picture of accessibility – the vast
 majority aren’t anywhere near accessible,” said
 Christopherson.
</p>
<p>  
 Common problems included unlabelled images, poor use of
 colour, and cluttered layouts, he said. Additionally, the
 increased popularity of social media add-ons to websites has
 caused problems: “If you embed the standard Facebook widget
 into your page – and Twitter, to a lesser extent – you’re going
 to have issues with accessibility. It’s not easy to make a Web
 2.0 website accessible. The prevailing level of accessibility out
 there is very low.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Audio Clips Help Disabled Job-Seekers AndEntrepreneurs.
</h3>
<p>  
 A web service offering audio clips to help people with long-
 term health conditions or disabilities to start their own
 businesses and become self-employed has been launched in
 Derbyshire.
</p>
<p>  
 The Work for Yourself programme (
 <a href="http://www.businessability.co.uk">http://www.businessability.co.uk</a>
 ) is funded by Bolsover District and Chesterfield Borough
 Councils, and has already helped about 30 local people start
 their own businesses and a similar number find work.
</p>
<p>  
 The new audio clips, commissioned from radio journalist
 Karen Woods, cover tips on writing a CV and on developing a
 business idea. The CV advice covers two different types
 including a ‘skills and experience’ style CV for people who
 have had employment gaps, for whatever reason. There are
 also examples of CVs that can be used as templates.
</p>
<p>  
 “We recognise a lot of people don’t like to read long
 documents, so we are looking at alternative ways of providing
 them with information”, says Penny Melville-Brown of
 consultancy Disability Dynamics (
 <a href="http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk">http://www.disabilitydynamics.co.uk</a>
 ), who is leading the programme. “So if somebody is speaking
 the concepts, it might just make it easier for some people.”
</p>
<p>  
 Melville-Brown is herself an entrepreneur with a disability –
 she is blind and has been running her own business for ten
 years. All her consultants and advisers are also self-employed,
 “so we are living it ourselves”, she says.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Special Report: International LawJodhan vs Canadian Government
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Challenging The SystemBy Tristan Parker
</h3>
<p>  
 It’s fair to say that Canadian citizen Donna Jodhan knows a
 thing or two about accessibility. A specialist consultant in the
 field with more than 16 years’ experience, her company has
 worked with numerous clients, including financial institutions
 and the University of Toronto. She has obtained Systems
 Engineering Certification from Microsoft and won various
 technical awards from IBM.
</p>
<p>  
 So when Jodhan – herself legally classed as blind – brought a
 case against the Canadian Federal Government, stating that the
 lack of accessibility of its websites for blind and visually
 impaired Canadian citizens meant that her rights were being
 breached, she made a formidable opponent.
</p>
<p>  
 The problems which led to her action began in 2006, when
 Jodhan was unable to create a job profile on the Government
 of Canada’s employment website – the point of access for all
 federal government job opportunities. When trying to complete
 a section of the form (the ‘date available’ field) she simply
 received an error message each time. She attempted to contact
 the site’s owners, but the phone number provided was out of
 service.
</p>
<p>  
 Jodhan was forced to seek assistance from a sighted
 government employee to create a job profile, but was still
 unable to review any of the information entered, as she was
 not given any user identification or password.
</p>
<p>  
 In addition to the problems with job applications, she was also
 unable to complete a 2006 online Census form from Statistics
 Canada, the country’s national statistical agency. The form was
 only fully accessible to blind and visually impaired users who
 used the most recent version of the JAWS screen-reader – an
 expensive piece of technology, costing around 1,000 Canadian
 Dollars at the time. Jodhan was again forced to rely on sighted
 assistance from a government employee to complete the
 Census, which she regarded as an invasion of her privacy.
</p>
<p>  
 Furthermore, Jodhan found she was unable to access
 information on Canada’s national consumer price index and
 unemployment rate, again on Statistics Canada’s website, as the
 information was only available in a PDF file, which had not
 been adapted for screen-readers. Jodhan was informed by
 government employees that no alternative formats were
 available.
</p>
<p>  
 Jodhan’s continued issues with government sites led her to
 consult a group of lawyers and an international accessibility
 expert, to find out what her legal position was. “I did this after
 years of having tried to convince the Canadian Government
 that their websites were not very accessible”, Jodhan told E-
 Access Bulletin. “It was extremely difficult for blind and sight-
 impaired Canadians to navigate their websites to obtain
 relevant information, and complete forms in order to process
 requests and fill out job applications.”
</p>
<p>  
 In 2007, Jodhan’s lawyers filed court papers asking the
 Canadian Government to comply with widely used
 accessibility standards from the World Wide Web Consortium
 (W3C). Between 2007-09, settlement negotiations were
 attempted but did not succeed, “because we did not feel that
 the Canadian Government was serious enough about our
 concerns” says Jodhan.
</p>
<p>  
 As a result, cross examinations of witnesses, accessibility
 experts and Jodhan herself took place in 2009, and in
 September of this year Jodhan and her lawyers attended
 Federal Court to present their case. “My lawyers argued that
 under the Canadian Charter of Rights, all Canadians have to be
 treated equally and that inaccessible governmental websites to
 blind and sight-impaired Canadians was a violation of the
 Charter. The government argued that they had fulfilled their
 obligations”.
</p>
<p>  
 With the case having been heard, the court is currently ‘resting’
 – in other words, it has retired to deliberate – and the judge’s
 decision is expected to be handed down within three or four
 months. Jodhan says she and her lawyers are “cautiously
 optimistic” about the result.
</p>
<p>  
 Whatever the outcome of the case, it has brought considerable
 publicity to a subject that is often swept under the carpet, with
 Jodhan’s ‘Charter Challenge’ receiving media coverage
 throughout Canada, the US, the UK and even India. “This topic
 needs to receive continuous attention and we believe that this
 court case is the perfect way to do it,” she says.
</p>
<p>  
 Canada currently has no specific legal obligations to conform
 with web accessibility standards, although there are non-
 binding guidelines in place (Common Look and Feel for the
 Internet 2.0 – CLF: <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf2-nsi2/index-">http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf2-nsi2/index-</a>
 eng.asp ) that have requested federal government websites to
 comply with international ‘WCAG 1.0’ standards since 2000.
</p>
<p>  
 Jodhan and her lawyers argue that the CLF guidelines are
 outdated, and say legislation should be introduced that requires
 government sites to conform to updated ‘WCAG 2.0’ standards
 guidelines. “A best effort basis will not solve this problem”,
 she says.
</p>
<p>  
 Jodhan believes that the Canadian Government does not see
 website accessibility and availability of information for blind
 and visually impaired citizens as a priority. “It is my opinion
 that the Canadian Government believes that blind and sight-
 impaired Canadians can get by using sighted assistance,” she
 says.
</p>
<p>  
 In terms of private sector websites, these too should be
 mandated to adhere to strict accessibility standards, says
 Jodhan, but in any case, the Canadian Government should lead
 by example. “If they were to take the lead in this area, then
 others would naturally follow. It has to be a real and committed
 effort by all stakeholders and rightsholders – legislation,
 training, and working together.”
