<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New Government Forum To Drive Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 The UK government's new 'eAccessibility Forum' will address
 three key areas: improving the regulatory framework;
 supporting businesses; and developing an 'e-accessibility
 action plan, Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture, Communications
 and Creative Industries, told delegates at the recent E-Access
 '10 event in London (
 <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess10/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess10/</a>
 ). The event was hosted by E-Access Bulletin publisher Headstar with the
 OneVoice Coalition for Accessible ICT.
</p>
<p> 
 The eAccessibility Forum was announced in the Digital Britain
 Act and is led by officials at the Department for Business,
 Innovation and Skills (BIS). On its first area of work,
 regulation, Vaizey said a consultation document would be
 published in September on the UK's implementation of the
 Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications in the
 European Union, amended in November of last year, which
 covers electronic accessibility. The UK is required to transpose
 the framework by the end of 2011, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The forum's eventual 'e-accessibility action plan' will cover
 both consumer technologies and website accessibility, Vaizey
 said. &quot;[This] doesn't necessarily mean by imposing regulations
 on bodies. It can be through partnership and persuasiveness as
 well and working together,&quot; he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The minister was speaking the day after UK digital champion
 Martha Lane Fox launched her Manifesto for a Networked
 Nation: <a href="http://raceonline2012.org/manifesto">http://raceonline2012.org/manifesto</a>
 ) which included the recommendation (in paragraph 9.2) that
 &quot;Government should close down publicly funded websites that
 consistently fail to meet its own web accessibility guidelines.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Australian 'E-Playground' For Children Of All Abilities.</h3>
<p> 
 Memory-improvement games and an activity allowing children
 to create their own music are two of the games in a new free
 online play environment for children with special needs and
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The All Abilities ePlayground (
 <a href="http://www.allabilitiesplayground.net.au/">http://www.allabilitiesplayground.net.au/</a>
 ) was created by the Australian arm of Sonokids (
 <a href="http://www.sonokids.org/">http://www.sonokids.org/</a>
 ), an international non-profit organisation developing technology for disabled people. It was
 commissioned by Gold Coast City Council in Queensland,
 Australia, with the state's Department of Communities
 (Disability Services).
</p>
<p> 
 Access features include a 'function for children with limited
 motor skills who can blow into a microphone to control games;
 and a 'single switch' control for children who are only able to
 use a single button on a computer.
</p>
<p> 
 The platform is based on the objectives behind 17 outdoor 'All
 Abilities' playgrounds built by councils across Queensland, as
 part of a government project.
</p>
<p> 
 Phia Damsma, creative director of Sonokids Australia, told E-
 Access Bulletin the ePlayground was designed to be as
 inclusive as possible. &quot;In addition to more traditional devices
 like keyboards, mice and joysticks, the ePlayground is tailored
 for use with touch screens and low-tech assistive
 technologies&quot;, Damsma said.
</p>
<p> 
 The ePlayground received positive feedback after being tested
 by special schools and special education units throughout
 Queensland, and it is hoped funding will be found for further
 development including personalising the platform to offer
 relevant local educational information, said Damsma.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The current ePlayground introduces children to iconic
 Australian animals such as kangaroos, pelicans and crocs. We
 invite requests for Sonokids to localise and customise the
 ePlayground's design concept to suit other countries, languages
 and cultures&quot;, she said.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Council Offers Real-Time Sign Language Video.</h3>
<p> 
 Deaf users of Sutton Council's website in the UK will be able
 to contact customer services through a live, online sign
 language interpreter, in what the system's owners believe to be
 the first service of its kind.
</p>
<p> 
 Sutton Council's website (
 <a href="http://www.sutton.gov.uk/">http://www.sutton.gov.uk/</a>
 ) features a 'SignVideo' link which connects deaf users to a
 specialist video call centre staffed by British Sign Language
 interpreters. The interpreters then contact the relevant council
 department and act as translators between the deaf website user
 and the hearing council staff member. This means that deaf
 website users can instantly discuss their queries with the
 council from any location with internet access and a webcam,
 without first having to book an appointment to ensure an
 interpreter is present.
</p>
<p> 
 The system was created by the social enterprise Significan't (
 <a href="http://www.bsl.org.uk/">http://www.bsl.org.uk/</a>
 ). Brigitte Francois, director of interpreting services at Significan't, told E-Access Bulletin that
 as well as giving deaf residents equal access to customers
 services within the council, the system also makes financial
 sense for the council.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;People are reluctant to book interpreters for a small
 conversation of 10-15 minutes, because most face-to-face
 interpreters charge for a minimum of three hours,&quot; Francois
 said. &quot;Significan't's director, Jeff McWhinney, decided that
 video interpreting would bring a solution to this. Face-to-face
 interpreting is very necessary - we don't want to get rid of it -
 but in some circumstances it makes sense and is more cost
 efficient to be able to make a short call on the videophone.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The system has already received positive feedback from
 residents in Sutton, a borough in which there are around 250
 deaf people. Sutton is the only London borough to have been
 awarded accreditation for accessibility by the Shaw Trust, a
 charity which assists disabled people to find and prepare for
 employment.

<p>  Last issue, Noel Hatch of Kent Council asked readers if they knew of any research into how disabled
 people use digital technologies.
</p>
<p> 
 In response, management consultant Sue Thomas, formerly of
 EDS, writes: &quot;I ran a study in 2007 for the UK Disability and
 Carers Service to see if the service could meet the targets they
 had been set to improve their current rate of use of online
 services from 1% to 8%.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The study showed that around 45% of those suffering a
 disability and 65% of their carers had the propensity to use
 online services. The barrier was not their ability to use the
 technology but the cost of entry both in high speed broadband
 and technology.&quot;

<h3 id="i127-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Short Links:</h3>
<p>  Also in our June issue, Clive Lever wrote in to suggest a change to the way we publish web addresses in the
 bulletin. He suggested that where links were so long they run
 over a line, they should be accompanied by a shorter 'alias'
 link so people could choose which one to click.
</p>
<p> 
 Jude DaShiell, a computer programmer in the US civil service
 and regular E-Access Bulletin correspondent, wrote in to say:
 &quot;It's never necessary for an organisation to use external
 services to provide short urls and doing so only involves setting
 up a blog on which to place content, then using short unique
 links to articles on that blog in email messages. As an example,
 today is July 4, 2010. I can write that using a date code in four
 letters; tjgd. The first two letters are the year t being the 20th
 letter in the alphabet and j being the 10th, that encodes 2010.
 The g is the 7th month in the year and d is the 4th day.
 Probably the easiest way to handle the last five days in a 31
 day month would be to use uppercase letters running from A to
 E.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 [EDITOR'S NOTE: Thanks for everyone's input, and we have
 made a decision - Jude's idea is a good one, but it does not
 really work for links to external stories as we cannot post those
 onto our blog, and also if we have many stories on the same
 date. As a compromise and to hopefully offer something for
 everyone, where links are long we will now offer a short link
 after every one, on a separate line. People can choose which
 one to use, and ignore the other. Please continue to provide
 your feedback on the results - further responses please to

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Real World Approaches To AccessibilityBy Brian Kelly.
</h3>
<p> 
 The theme of the Seventh International Cross-Disciplinary
 Conference on Web Accessibility (W4A 2010 -
 <a href="http://www.w4a.info/">http://www.w4a.info/</a>
 ), held in North Carolina in April, was 'Developing regions:
 common goals, common problems?'
</p>
<p> 
 This provided an ideal opportunity to highlight the limitations
 of approach taken by the international World Wide Web
 Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to web
 accessibility, which is enshrined in legislation in many
 developed countries, and to argue that developing countries are
 in a position to avoid repeating mistakes made in the Western
 world.
</p>
<p> 
 One key issue is the importance of understanding the context
 of the use of web resources. The approaches taken to
 accessibility in a teaching and learning or cultural appreciation
 context may be very different from those taken to access to
 informational resources, for example. The resource costs
 associated with the provision of accessible web resources also
 need to be considered, and policies which endorse a view that
 all resources must be universally accessible to everyone, no
 matter what the cost implications may be, is naive and, in any
 case, is in conflict with legal requirements to take &quot;reasonable
 measures&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 The question of the costs of providing accessible services is
 becoming even more important in the UK in light of the new
 government's budget in which we can expect to see significant
 cutbacks in funding for the public sector. The economic
 concerns which we are currently facing will also be shared by
 those in developing countries.
</p>
<p> 
 Two examples from disability studies illustrate the value of
 applying critical theories to support more holistic approaches to
 web accessibility: 'Aversive disablism', and 'Hierarchies of
 impairment'. Aversive disablism is illustrated using a
 comparison with race theory: aversive racists are not anti-
 black, but pro-white. There is a need to understand how
 approaches to accessibility might be based on pro-non-disabled
 assumptions. Such considerations should be understood from
 the context of 'Hierarchies of impairment'.
</p>
<p> 
 The City University academic Mark Deal argued the need to be
 &quot;focusing attention on impairment groups that face the most
 discrimination in society (i.e. those ranked lowest in the
 hierarchy of impairments), rather than viewing disabled people
 as a homogenous group&quot;. In the context of web accessibility,
 the focus of attention is often the needs of the visually-
 impaired, with the needs of users with learning difficulties
 having been seemingly marginalised in the development of
 accessibility guidelines. We conclude that &quot;Critical research
 into accessibility for such groups is therefore recommended
 before standards can be invested&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 In light of such concerns, should we simply shrug our
 shoulders and abandon any commitment to addressing the
 challenges of enhancing access to web resources? On the
 contrary, rather than ignoring WAI's Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG) altogether, we should treat them as just
 that - guidelines, which are useful in many instances but can
 be disregarded if they are ineffective.
</p>
<p> 
 And rather than looking for an answer in a set of guidelines,
 which, in the case of WCAG 2.0 are relatively new, we should
 be looking for patterns of emerging best practices.
</p>
<p> 
 One example is the use of networked technologies in
 'amplified events', in which Twitter 'back channels', access to
 speaker slides on SlideShare and video or audio streaming can
 enhance access to people not physically present at an event.
 We should regard this as providing many accessibility (and
 environmental) benefits - indeed it might be argued that a
 failure to use such affordable technologies to provide event
 amplification could be regarded as discriminatory.
</p>
<p> 
 So rather than regarding WCAG conformance as a mandatory
 requirement, WCAG should be regarded as guidelines, which
 may be ignored if their use conflicts with other requirements,
 so long as steps are taken to address the potential exclusion that
 may result. It should be noted that UK legislation that requires
 use of 'reasonable measures' to ensure that users with
 disabilities are not discriminated against unfairly, provides a
 legislative context for this approach. A policy based on
 'seeking to make use of WCAG' will provide the flexibility
 needed. This would not be possible with a policy which states
 that all resources must conform to WCAG.
</p>
<p> 
 'Reasonable measures' should also include identification of
 costs of conforming with accessibility guidelines. There should
 be consideration of the trade-off between financial savings and
 usability issues.
</p>
<p> 
 If it is too costly or difficult to conform with accessibility
 guidelines, the provision of alternatives that are equivalent may
 be an appropriate solution. It should also be noted that the
 alternative need not be web-based: for e-learning resources,
 equivalent real world learning alternatives may be used.
</p>
<p> 
 A requirement that all resources conform to WCAG is a 'just-
 in-case' solution. This may be an appropriate resource for
 widely accessed informational resources, but may be
 inappropriate if resources are expected to be little used. There
 may be advantages in delaying provision of accessibility
 solutions to allow development of technologies which can
 enable more cost-effective solutions to be devised.
</p>
<p> 
 The need to ensure that disabled people are included in the
 design and development of web solutions must also be
 emphasised. And finally, there needs to be a focus on
 'accessibility', rather than 'web accessibility': the benefits of
 web or IT solutions to real world accessibility difficulties needs
 to be considered. As described above, amplified events can
 address difficulties in travel and access, even though the
 technologies used may not conform with accessibility
 guidelines.
