<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01:  Accessibility Is ‘Business Opportunity’, Minister TellsEab.
</h3>
<p> 
 The work of the government’s newly-launched e-Accessibility
 Forum will include demonstrating to businesses that
 accessibility is a financial opportunity rather than just a cost,
 the Minister for Culture, Communication and Creative
 Industries, Ed Vaizey, told E-Access Bulletin in an exclusive
 interview this week.
</p>
<p> 
 Led by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the
 e-Accessibility Forum ( <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/e-accessibility">http://www.bis.gov.uk/e-accessibility</a>
 ) will bring together more than 60 members from government,
 industry and the voluntary sector, working to deliver more
 accessible digital services, content and goods for disabled
 consumers. Some of the forum’s work is detailed in an e-
 Accessibility Action Plan which will be updated quarterly (
 available as a PDF at: <a href="http://bit.ly/8Xh71O">http://bit.ly/8Xh71O</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 “The main challenge is to overcome the perception that e-
 accessibility costs money, that it’s a burden on business as
 opposed to being an opportunity for business,” Vaizey told
 EAB. “We want to really embed e-accessibility into a whole
 range of agendas, making sure that it is part and parcel of
 everything we do.”
</p>
<p> 
 Overall awareness of e-accessibility needs to be improved by
 promotion of the forum and its work, he said. “It’s all very
 well for me to say that government should take a lead, but one
 can pretty much guarantee that there will be a lot of individual
 initiatives from government that won’t take account of the e-
 accessibility agenda, and therefore it’s very important for me to
 publicise it as widely as possible to my colleagues, so that they
 know about this agenda and they understand what their
 obligations are towards it.”
</p>
<p> 
 Government will play two key roles in the forum, said Vaizey.
 The first is as a “co-ordinator”, part of which will involve
 publicising best practice on, for example, web access standards
 or manufacturing of accessible goods. Second, government will
 help set the agenda for a specific ‘Regulatory work stream’ –
 one of five work streams detailed in the Action Plan – which
 will involve work on the EU Framework Directives for
 Electronic Communications Networks and Services, and
 applying public procurement standards.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, the forum’s approach will primarily be one of working
 with and educating organisations rather than forcing regulation.
 However, Vaizey said this should not be a barrier to progress,
 as the companies he has discussed these issues with so far are
 proving receptive. “I have to say, I’ve found the private sector
 very willing to engage in this agenda. I think they see it as
 absolutely in their self-interest if they can provide products and
 equipment everyone can use. I don’t feel like I’m bullying the
 private sector into doing anything, I feel very much that this is
 part of a very strong partnership.”
</p>
<p> 
 The Action Plan also features a ‘Websites services’ work
 stream, which plans to issue regular updates on web access
 issues, and highlight and encourage best practice. As more
 government services move online, the whole e-accessibility
 agenda will become increasingly essential, said Vaizey.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Multimedia Report For World Standards Day.</h3>
<p> 
 A new technical report on accessibility for audio, video, and
 multimedia systems and equipment has been published by the
 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), an
 international standards body for electronics, as part of activities
 to mark this year’s accessibility-themed World Standards Day.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, IEC/TR 62678, provides information on
 accessibility and usability terms, activities, completed and
 ongoing standards, technical reports and projects, and is
 available as a pdf from:

</p>
<p> 
 World Standards Day 2010, which took place on 14 October,
 was themed ‘accessibility for all’ in an effort to promote the
 importance of codes, standards, and conformity assessment
 activities in developing and maintaining the built environment,
 products, technologies and systems that are accessible for
 persons with special needs:
 <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/wsd2010.htm">http://www.iso.org/iso/wsd2010.htm</a>
</p>
<p> 
 The project unites the work of the three main global standards
 bodies – the IEC, the International Organization for
 Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication
 Union (ITU).
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, the AccessAbility special interest group (SIG) of
 the Society for Technical Communication, a professional
 association for technical writers including editors, graphic
 designers and web page designers, is set to release a draft copy
 of guidance on producing conference accessibility guides.
</p>
<p> 
 Aimed at anyone involved in the organisation of a major event
 or conference, the document will describe what areas to cover
 from an accessibility perspective including transport to and
 from the venue, accommodation, a venue guide and
 presentation equipment, Karen Mardahl, Co-Manager of the
 SIG, told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Publishers And Campaigners Unite To Boost Text-To-Speech.
</h3>
<p> 
 A call for text-to-speech functions to be included on all
 electronic book platforms to improve their accessibility has
 been issued by a group of publishing and literary organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 The Publishers Association, The Society of Authors, The
 Association of Authors Agents and The Right to Read Alliance
 – itself an umbrella campaign group, whose members include
 The Royal National Institute of Blind People – grouped
 together to issue the joint statement. It recommended that
 speech functions, which help many print-disabled readers
 access a range of otherwise inaccessible e-books, “is routinely
 enabled on all e-books across all platforms, at least where there
 is no audio-book edition commercially available.”
</p>
<p> 
 The statement continued: “It is in the interests of publishers for
 their published content to be available and accessible to as
 many people as possible. This includes the broadening of the
 market to those with visual impairments or other disabilities”.
</p>
<p> 
 The recommendation follows ongoing disputes over the
 inclusion of text-to-speech functions on e-book readers. Last
 year US manufacturer Amazon allowed publishers to disable
 the feature on an early version of its Kindle e-book reader,
 after an authors’ rights group claimed that the text-to-speech
 function effectively breached a royalties agreement ( see E-
 Access Bulletin issue 110:
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=244</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 However, Amazon subsequently agreed to incorporate extra
 accessibility features into the Kindle after several American
 universities rejected the device as a potential teaching-aid,
 citing inaccessibility to blind students ( see
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=383">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=383</a>
 ).</p>

<h3 id="i130-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Canadian Challenge:</h3>
<p>  A blind woman has launched a case against the Canadian Government in the country’s Federal
 Court after she was unable to apply for a government job
 online in 2004 or complete a 2006 online census using a text-
 to-speech screen-reader. Donna Jodhan, an accessibility
 consultant who has won four design awards from IBM, is
 arguing that the inaccessibility of online government
 information constitutes a breach of her equality rights under
 the Canadian Charter Rights of Freedoms. The case has now
 been heard, although the court is not expected to announce its
 decision for about six months:

<h3 id="i130-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Equality, Updated:</h3>
<p>  New UK legal provisions on equality have come into force that could be used to take action against
 owners of inaccessible websites. Some 90% of the provisions
 of the Equality Act 2010 came into force on 1 October,
 including a new concept of “indirect discrimination”, which
 means that discrimination does not require knowledge. This
 could mean that even if website owners are unaware that their
 sites are inaccessible, they could still be breaching the act. The
 act also introduces an obligation for service providers and
 employers to provide information in accessible electronic
 formats:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Policy FocusBritish Standard 8878 on Web Accessibility.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Complementary GuidanceBy Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 It’s certainly taken a while, but next month should finally see
 the long-awaited arrival of BS 8878 – a British Standard on
 web accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Developed by IST/45, a sub-committee of the British Standards
 Institution ( BSi: <a href="http://www.bsigroup.com/">http://www.bsigroup.com/</a>
 ), BS 8878 provides guidance on making websites accessible for disabled and
 elderly users. It has been in the making for some four years,
 with two public drafts released for comment, of which there
 was plenty. After further input from a wide range of field
 experts, extensive user testing, and numerous modifications,
 the final version of the standard is now expected to be
 published at the end of November.
</p>
<p> 
 When discussing standards, it’s tempting to associate them with
 technical knowledge, especially when concerned with a
 complex topic like website accessibility. However, BS 8878 is
 aimed at people who, generally, will not possess a large degree
 of specialist IT knowledge.
</p>
<p> 
 David Fatscher, sector development manager at BSi, told E-
 Access Bulletin this month: “It’s definitely not what we’d call a
 technical standard. It’s very much aimed at website owners,
 who may not think about technical issues when they’re about
 to procure a web-based product. This could be people in a
 press or marketing department, and some organisations are
 rolling out web-based products internally, so again, the site
 owner could be someone from the HR department.”
</p>
<p> 
 Neither is the new British standard an attempt to replace the
 latest version of the well-established international Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Fatscher says. Those
 guidelines ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/</a>
 ) are aimed primarily at web developers, and contain detailed technical
 accessibility recommendations. BS 8878 aims to complement
 WCAG by providing a straightforward narrative for a non-
 technical audience. The result, says Fatscher, is “a very
 readable document to help people understand what they need
 to consider when revamping or launching a web product for
 their users.”
</p>
<p> 
 The standard has gone through huge changes since its first draft
 several years ago, and is now “tremendously different” from
 its original incarnation, says Fatscher. The foundations of BS
 8878 were laid down in 2006, when BSi was commissioned to
 create a web accessibility guidance document by the Equality
 and Human Rights Commission. The result was a ‘Publicly
 Available Specification’, ‘PAS 78: a guide to good practice in
 commissioning accessible websites’.
</p>
<p> 
 “Because technology is changing so rapidly, we felt we needed
 to revise that document” says Fatscher. “This happens with any
 commissioned work that BSi takes on. After three years, we
 talk to the sponsor and say ‘does this work or shall we re-
 commission some new work?’ We felt that it would be useful
 to revise PAS 78, update it and bring it up to full British
 Standard status, to give it even more credibility.”
</p>
<p> 
 After extensive public feedback on the first draft, issued in
 December 2008, a second draft was published in May 2010,
 which contained additional guidance on areas including: The
 Equality Act 2010; procuring accessible web products; and
 dealing with feedback and complaints on accessibility from
 users.
</p>
<p> 
 However, many of the key changes made to BS 8878 reflect
 the constant technological advancements that have taken place
 since the first draft. Two years is a long time in technology,
 and the final standard has also been adapted to encompass new
 methods of accessing the internet, such as the onset of web-
 enabled mobile devices, including smartphones.
</p>
<p> 
 The concept of website personalisation is also addressed in the
 final version of BS 8878. As discussed by IST/45 committee
 chair Jonathan Hassell of the BBC after the second draft of the
 standard was opened up for public feedback (see E-Access
 Bulletin issue 125: <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=427">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=427</a>
 ), personalisation takes into account that different people use and
 access websites in different ways.
</p>
<p> 
 The final standard develops this idea and advises website
 owners on options for building tools into their site to give users
 a customisable website experience. This is particularly useful
 for sites such as e-learning platforms, social networking sites
 and educational establishments, which encounter a wide user-
 base performing a variety of functions.
</p>
<p> 
 User feedback on the BS 8878 drafts was critical in shaping the
 structure of the final standard, says Fatscher, and provided
 much of the incentive for changes and additions, as each draft
 was subject to rigorous public consultation. “The user
 community is rightly very vocal in terms of what they expect,”
 says Fatscher, “and what we found was that while that first
 draft was a pretty good stab, it didn’t reach into all the areas we
 needed to explore. So it was very much a case of going back
 over things and looking at all the public comments.”
</p>
<p> 
 The volume of user feedback was one of the main reasons for
 the considerable delay in launching the final standard, which
 had previously been estimated at summer 2009. “This is the
 whole point of the British Standard development process” says
 Fatscher. “It’s not something that has just been cooked up by
 12 people around a table and then made available as ‘good
 practice’. [The standard] has gone out to public comment to
 become more robust and credible. Because the draft got the
 reaction it did, it meant we had to come back to it and take on
 board those comments, but that makes it a stronger document.”
</p>
<p> 
 The second delay came during summer of last year, when the
 European Committee for Standardization (CEN) intervened due
 to concerns about harmonisation of standards. CEN were
 worried that a second set of web accessibility guidelines (after
 WCAG) may confuse people. However, after BSi explained
 the nature of BS 8878 and demonstrated that the standard
 referenced WCAG 2.0 and complemented it, work was allowed
 to continue.
</p>
<p> 
 As for the future, it is hoped that BS 8878 will tie-in with wider
 e-accessibility plans unveiled by government, says Fatscher, as
 digital accessibility becomes an increasingly prominent topic. A
 promising start has already been made in this area, with the
 standard being referenced in the recent ‘eAccessibility Action
 Plan’ launched by Ed Vaizey (see lead news story, this issue),
 with a request for government to help BSi promote and
 implement the standard: “The BSI should be supported in their
 work to develop BS8878 which signposts website developers
 and commissioners to WCAG2 and provides credible non-
 technical guidance on how to implement these guidelines,” the
 Action Plan says.
</p>
<p> 
 Fatscher is now optimistic that government support, for both
 the standard and e-accessibility overall, will help to spread the
 message about BS 8878 far and wide: “There’s been a lot of
 goodwill and good talk from government about e-accessibility,
 and I would expect lot of public sector websites to be procured
 and developed with BS 8878 in mind. In terms of the private
 sector – as digital inclusion becomes more of talking point, [the
 sector will realise that] if you don’t have a website which is as
 accessible as it could be, you are going to be shutting down
 10% of your potential customers.”
</p>
<p> 
 The final version of BS 8878 is expected to be launched next
 month, with an official launch event following on December 7
 in London. BSi has produced an introductory video on BS
 8878, which can be viewed on their YouTube Channel:
