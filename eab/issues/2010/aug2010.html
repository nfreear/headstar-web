<h3 id="i128-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Apple Devices ‘Revolutionary’ For Built-In Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices are “revolutionary” and
 “game-changing” in offering built-in accessibility functions for
 people with disabilities, delegates heard at this year’s E-Access
 ’10 conference in London.
</p>
<p> 
 Kiran Kaja of the RNIB Digital Accessibility Team told a mobile
 phone workshop that while accessibility applications are available
 for other smartphones – such as the ‘Eyes Free Shell’ for Google’s
  Android phone – the iPhone 3G is a “game-changer” because its
 accessibility features are built in across all its functions.
</p>
<p> 
 Using the standard touch-screen you can move your fingers along
 and the phone reads what is underneath them; and if you swipe down
 with two fingers it reads from that point to the end, Kaja said. A
 double-tap with three fingers will magnify the screen.
</p>
<p> 
 “A lot of people say they can’t use a touch-screen, but when I
 show them this it really changes their perspectives,” he said.
 “People have started asking why they should pay extra money for
 accessibility on mainstream devices. So slowly we are seeing
 changing expectations. When Symbian [an operating system for
 mobile phones] was released in 2000, it was two or three years
 before assistive technology was developed for it, so phones could
 be out of date before assistive technology appears. With the
 iPhone, I could use it the same day as my sighted friends.”
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility features that are built in by the manufacturer are
 also more stable than added extras like screen-readers running on
 top of an operating system, Kaja said.
</p>
<p> 
 Apple’s new ‘iPad’ table computer – which functions much like a
 huge iPhone – was also singled out for praise by Robin Spinks,
 Principal Manager, Digital Accessibility at RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The iPad’s size meant it was a “revolutionary” improvement for
 partially-sighted users, who could use it at a normal distance
 like a more visible smartphone, with applications and the keyboard
 feature all viewed larger, Spinks said.
</p>
<p> 
 Used as an electronic book reader, the iPad can also magnify text,
 and it featured the same built-in access functions as the iPhone
 3G such as the double-tap with three fingers to magnify the
 screen, he said. “One of the advantages of Apple’s much-criticised
 “walled garden” approach is that is can build in accessibility to
 all functions.”
</p>
<p> 
 Further accessibility features are likely to be added to
 smartphones in future that make use of the built-in gyroscopes and
 accelerometers found in most modern phones, said Kiran Kaja. “They
 are mainly used by games developers now , but could also have uses
 for people with disabilities,” he said. Early examples include the
 free ‘Dasher’ app which allows the user to tilt and move the phone
 with one hand to select items, a feature of use to many people
 with impaired mobility:

<h3 id="i128-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Voluntary Compliance To Web Access Standards ‘Inadequate’.</h3>
<p> 
 Voluntary application of technical standards on accessibility of
 web sites to people with disabilities has proved “inadequate”,
 suggesting more formal regulation is needed, the US government has
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 In a document issued as part of a public consultation process on
 four new proposed regulations to extend the Americans with
 Disabilities Act (ADA) to improve technology access for disabled
 people, the US Department of Justice said: “Voluntary standards
 have generally proved to be sufficient where obvious business
 incentives align with discretionary governing standards as, for
 example, with respect to privacy and security standards designed
 to increase consumer confidence in e-commerce. There has not,
 however, been equal success in the area of accessibility.”
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, it says: “It is clear that the system of voluntary
 compliance has proved inadequate in providing website
 accessibility to individuals with disabilities” (
 <a href="http://www.ada.gov/anprm2010/web%20anprm_2010.htm">http://www.ada.gov/anprm2010/web%20anprm_2010.htm</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 As well as web accessibility – covering online goods and services
 – the four ‘advance notices of proposed rulemaking’ (ANPRMs) cover
 captioning and video description in cinemas; equipment and
 furniture; and the widening of how emergency (911) telephone calls
 can be made.
</p>
<p> 
 On captioning and video, comments are invited on the types of
 technology that could be used in cinemas to make film screenings
 more accessible, including closed captioning and audio description
 equipment. The department proposes a ‘sliding compliance
 schedule’, whereby the percentage of cinemas offering such
 technologies would increase from 10 per cent in year one to 50 per
 cent in year five.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘equipment and furniture’ notice covers accessibility of ATMs
 (cash machines) and point-of-sale devices, asking for public
 comment on access technologies such as voice-operated and tactile
 systems.
</p>
<p> 
 The ‘Accessibility of Next Generation 9-1-1’ notice examines the
 possibility of internet-based text or video emergency calls being
 put through to an operator directly, rather than the individual
 having to go through a third-party telecommunications assistant
 who relays the call, as is currently the case.
</p>
<p> 
 All notice summaries can be viewed at:

<h3 id="i128-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Japanese Cloud ‘To Improve E-Government Accessibility’.</h3>
<p> 
 A ‘web accessibility cloud centre’ to help Japanese government
 departments improve online services to elderly and disabled people
 is being built by a consortium led by IBM Japan:
 <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32265.wss">http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32265.wss</a>
 Short Link: <a href="http://bit.ly/bEpADT">http://bit.ly/bEpADT</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Working with IT solutions firm the KOA Corporation and the Tottori
 Prefecture Information-Center (TIC: a third sector Japanese
 company that supports government IT projects), the cloud centre
 will feature a collaborative system that allows citizens to browse
 government websites; report any accessibility issues they
 encounter; and suggest improvements. For example, users with
 visual impairments will be able to easily record difficulties in
 understanding text or images.
</p>
<p> 
 Each accessibility request will be stored in a bank for later
 consultation by designers of government website pages, allowing
 them to address issues raised.
</p>
<p> 
 The collaborative aspect of the web accessibility improvement
 system is based on technology developed in 2008 by the Tokyo arm
 of IBM Research as part of its Social Accessibility Project
 examining issues faced by visually impaired internet users (see
 <a href="http://sa.watson.ibm.com">http://sa.watson.ibm.com</a>

<p>  The new UK government has backtracked on a firm timetable for implementation of all parts of the Equality Act
 2010, a leading lawyer has said. Audrey Williams, partner at law
 firm Eversheds, said that while the coalition government has
 confirmed the act will begin coming into force in October as
 originally planned, guidance from the Government Equalities Office
 (GEO) suggests that some elements of the law, such as the
 extension of public sector equality duties and the introduction of
 rules prohibiting age discrimination by service providers, have
 been put on hold, with no set implementation date:

<p>  AnnaMarie Beresford, a trainer at the Sunderland-based community interest company ‘Disability Arts
 Empowerment’ ( <a href="http://www.dartecic.org.uk/">http://www.dartecic.org.uk/</a>
 ) that trains people who have long term disabilities and mental ill health, writes in
 with a heartfelt comment about a major accessibility issue that is
 not always properly recognised: affordability.
</p>
<p> 
 “I have found that as many as 8 out of 10 of our learners cannot
 access the internet due to the expense of adaptive software (as
 many free to install items just don't cut it),” Beresford says.”
 Also the sheer lack of money and computers on the cheap are often
 out of their reach even if they can access training.

 “I am a deafblind physically disabled person who has mental health
 issues, and it is only the fact that I have been lucky enough to

 that I can afford to have the luxury (to me a necessity) of being
 able to access the web and do many functions other people without
 impairments take for granted.
</p>
<p> 
 “I too have been isolated due to affordability issues with regard
 to cost of equipment and technology - not to mention the price of
 software! Until this changes many of us will stay isolated.”

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: E-Access ’10 Conference Report - Social NetworksDiscussion Group.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Digital Lifeline By Dan Jellinek.</h3>
<p> 
 For people with motor disabilities, who may have problems leaving
 the house, communicating or with social confidence, online social
 networks can be a true liberator, delegates heard at this year’s
 E-Access ’10 conference hosted by Headstar and E-Access Bulletin
 with One Voice for Accessible ICT Coalition (
 <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess10">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess10</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 A discussion group on the accessibility of social networks to
 users with motor disabilities was hosted by Makayla Lewis of the
 Centre for Human-Computer Interaction Design, City University
 London, and herself a carer for her parents and a voluntary worker
 for people with cerebral palsy.
</p>
<p> 
 People with disabilities suffer from high rates of depression,
 said Lewis: many may only see one person a week, their carer. To
 such people social networks are a good way to share experiences
 and meet new people, even if their disability is severe, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 One young woman she had worked with had no siblings and stayed in
 her room most of the time, said Lewis. “She just used to sit in
 the corner.” For her, social networks had become indispensible.
</p>
<p> 
 “She says ‘I can’t socialise without it’, it’s is like food to her
 – she’s on it from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes
 to bed. Social networking allows you to portray yourself how you
 want”, Lewis said. Although the interaction is virtual, it can
 also help to build real friendships and help boost confidence for
 face to face communication as well, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The average person with a disability has 250 friends on Facebook,
 for example, compared with 130 for non-disabled people, Lewis
 said. Unfortunately, however, many people encounter barriers in
 using such networks, of which the biggest is accessibility. One
 problem was that while many people with motor disabilities would
 benefit from technologies such as voice recognition and
 text-to-speech screen-readers, public funding for these expensive
 tools is geared towards people with impaired vision.
</p>
<p> 
 “People with motor disabilities are given big keys and so on.
 Screen-readers would be very useful but they are not funded for
 that. You never find a screen-reader on a list of aids for them -
 they are not considered necessary for people with motor
 impairments. Funding is geared towards blindness.”
</p>
<p> 
 The problem can be even more basic, Lewis said: many occupational
 therapists, GPs and users themselves  don’t have the technical
 awareness or understanding to know what tools are available to
 help people access computers. “They don’t know the stuff is out
 there. The way you find out about access technologies these days
 is on the internet, but if you don’t have access to the
 internet...”
</p>
<p> 
 Some people with severe disabilities are helped in accessing
 computers by their carers, but this means their interactions
 cannot be independent and can be hampered by a lack of trust,
 Lewis said. “If you get tired, and a carer types for you, how is
 that independent communication? How is that private communication?
 A carer might leave after a few weeks, and a new one comes. So
 people can’t always trust them straight away, and just ask them to
 send messages online like ‘I’m fine, see you soon’ – they don’t
 open up and say what they want to say.”
</p>
<p> 
 There are also problems with the design of the main social
 networks, Lewis said, not least that the main sites often change
 their layout, which can present huge challenges to someone
 accessing a computer using a tool like a switch, who has learned
 over painstaking hours to navigate one layout only to find it has
 all been changed around. “With Facebook, they are always changing
 the site. Using a switch, you learn one format but then all of a
 sudden they rearrange the layout and task structure.”
</p>
<p> 
 One answer might be for sites like Facebook to have a fixed layout
 of their core features, such as your friends list and your
 profile, which would remain stable across redesigns, she said.
 Another might be to offer a simpler, pared-down version of the
 site which only presented the core features. However Facebook had
 removed just such a simpler version, ‘Facebook Lite’, for
 commercial reasons, despite it being used by many people with
 severe cerebral palsy, Lewis said.
</p>
<p> 
 Where changes are made, more understandable and relevant help
 could also be offered to users in working out what the differences
 were, she said.”Often changes are made to a site and people just
 have to work it out. They could be uploading photos showing how to
 use the new site step by step, like Twitter does online, with
 arrows.”
</p>
<p> 
 People with disabilities often prefer help information that is not
 text-based, such as videos or avatars, Lewis said. But they want
 to see images that are relevant to their own lives: “Many people
 with disabilities want help from an avatar who is also disabled”.
</p>
<p> 
 Apart from layout, many problems are caused by the small size of
 online features which can be not only hard to see but extremely
 hard to use for people with motor impairments, she said. Thus for
 example Facebook features such as the ‘like’ button to express
 your approval for something is too small for use by people with
 impaired motor control.
</p>
<p> 
 Because of the way Facebook is formatted – text size is hard-coded
 in - it s pages are also hard to magnify, Lewis said: users can
 zoom in using their own magnification tools, but the result is
 pixellated.
</p>
<p> 
 Nevertheless, many people persevere, she said: one user she knows
 highglights all the text from her Facebook news feed every hour;
 pastes it over into Word, where she can increase the text size
 smoothly;  writes her replies or posts in Word; pastes them back
 across to Facebook; and then spends 10 minutes trying to click on
 the ‘update’ button, because it is so small.
</p>
<p> 
 The fact someone is prepared to go to all this trouble “shows you
 how important it is for some people”, said Lewis.
</p>
<p> 
 When asked about accessibility, Facebook tends to say that only a
 small number of people with disabilities are using the site, but
 one of the main reasons for this is the inaccessibility of the
 ‘Captcha’ system of keying in distorted words that is used for
 registration to the site, Lewis said. Also, while there are tools
 specifically aimed at helping people with disabilities access
 Facebook and other networks, there is low awareness of them, she
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 Of course, Facebook is not the only network people can use, but
 the others are not much better, Lewis said. “MySpace is terrible.
 Bebo is better, but it is aimed at young people.”
</p>
<p> 
 Some other communities are set up specifically by and for people
 with certain disabilities, the workshop heard, such as Living With
 Ataxia (LWA - <a href="http://www.livingwithataxia.org">http://www.livingwithataxia.org</a>
), set up using the ‘Ning’ platform which allows anyone to set up a social network.
</p>
<p> 
 Alan Thomas, UK Community Manager of LWA,told delegates that such
 focused networks helped people with particularly problems overcome
 feelings of exclusion, by allowing them to share experiences.
</p>
<p> 
 On the other hand, people with disabilities also need to be able
 to access the same mainstream networks as everyone else, Lewis
 said. “Often networks are divided. Maybe they should link up more
 and integrate more.
</p>
<p> 
 “It is disgusting that some people have to go to such lengths to
 do something that is so fundamental for all human beings – to
 communicate with each other.”

 The site has recently been redesigned and the forum system
 improved. This is still ongoing and you can join in the
 discussions.
