<h3 id="i125-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Draft Web Access Standard Embraces Personalisation.</h3>
<p> 
 Personalisation of website accessibility, including customising
 tools and offering different versions of sites to suit individual
 needs, should be considered for some specialist websites such
 as social networking platforms, according to the latest draft of
 a British standard on web accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 The second draft of BS 8878 'Web accessibility - Code of
 practice', developed by a sub-committee of the British
 Standards Institution (BSI), IST/45, suggests that educational
 establishments, social networking sites, e-learning websites and
 other sites requiring a member login have an opportunity to
 provide users with personalisation facilities and &quot;an
 individualised approach to dealing with their accessibility
 needs&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Jonathan Hassell, chair of IST/45 and head of audience
 experience and usability for future media and technology at the
 BBC, told E-Access Bulletin's sister publication E-Government
 Bulletin that although still in its infancy, the personalisation
 approach to website accessibility is likely to develop
 significantly in coming years.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;In some situations, rather than trying to create a website for
 everybody, maybe the right thing to do is - where people's
 needs diverge - to create different versions of a website for
 different people. We may even want to have tools on a website
 enabling it to be personalised for the exact user.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Hassell also said the new draft was a &quot;process map&quot;, intended
 for those who may not be accessibility specialists, giving them
 an idea of points to consider when making a website
 accessible, and taking into account the wide-ranging needs of
 disabled internet users.
</p>
<p> 
 BS 8878 is not intended to replace existing guidance, such as
 version 2.0 of the international Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG), said Hassell: &quot;We're not replicating
 anything you might find in WCAG 2.0. It's a great standard. If
 you're at the point of technical web production, then process-
 wise and design-wise WCAG 2.0 is the document you should
 be looking at, and we point to it in BS 8878.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Other new suggestions in the second draft of the standard
 include a bigger focus on the accessibility needs of elderly
 people; accessibility factors to consider when procuring a
 website from a number of suppliers; and how the advent of
 internet viewing on new channels such as on mobile devices,
 tablet computers and television may affect accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Originally intended for publication in summer of last year, the
 second draft of BS 8878 was put back due to European
 intervention, Hassell said. The European Committee for
 Standardization (CEN) contacted the BSI after the first draft of
 BS 8878, expressing a desire for a common set of accessibility
 standards across Europe. However, this was retracted after a
 realisation that differing accessibility laws across member
 states would make a common standard extremely difficult to
 develop.
</p>
<p> 
 Feedback on the second draft of BS 8878 is invited before 30
 June, with an estimated publication date for the final standard
 of November. To give feedback, via the BSI website (the
 feedback mechanism of which has been made more
 accessible) or email, visit: <a href="http://bit.ly/cY8dND">http://bit.ly/cY8dND</a>
 . The second draft is available in Rich Text Format, and can be read by a
 wide range of word processors and screen-readers, after
 feedback on the first draft suggested that it was not fully
 accessible to some users.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Disability Linked To Digital Exclusion And'Disengagement'.
</h3>
<p> 
 Levels of home internet access in the UK are directly linked to
 a wide range of traditional indicators of social exclusion
 including disability, a digital inclusion seminar at City
 University, London heard this month.
</p>
<p> 
 Ellen Helsper, lecturer in media and communications at the
 London School of Economics and Political Science, told the
 seminar that among the disabled population, 59% do not have
 home access, compared with just 29% of the general
 population.
</p>
<p> 
 The main theories relating to causes of digital exclusion tend to
 revolve around cost of access, but surveys show that people
 tend to offer other reasons for their non-use such as
 discrimination, Helsper said. Accordingly, the focus of analysts
 has switched towards models that look beyond access into
 areas like skills, confidence, attitude and motivation.
</p>
<p> 
 People with disabilities have lower confidence levels and lower
 motivation to use the internet than others, she said. The average
 score for positive attitude towards internet use stands at 3.1 out
 of 5 for disabled adults compared to 3.3 for non-disabled
 adults; and 3.4/5 for disabled teenagers compared with 3.8/5
 for non-disabled teenagers.
</p>
<p> 
 There are a few encouraging signs, however: research shows
 that one third of non-users have somebody else who uses the
 internet for them, so they are part of networks which allow
 them access to the technology, Helsper said. &quot;In the health and
 social service sector, this is an important finding&quot;. People with
 disabilities tend to rely on children for proxy use, whereas
 people without disabilities tend to rely on friends or colleagues.
</p>
<p>  
 One new measure of digital inclusion or exclusion used by
 academics and researchers is that of digital 'engagement', she
 said. This measures not just whether people have access to the
 internet, or have the skills or the motivation to use it, but how
 wide a variety of activities they engage in.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Engagement views activity in a more social environment,
 geared around technologies - people exchanging information
 with each other, for example.&quot; The opposite - disengagement -
 may sometimes be related to the fact that not much content is
 available for some social groups, Helsper said. For example the
 types of jobs some people may be looking for may not be
 widely advertised on internet job sites.

<h3 id="i125-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Accessible E-Books "Tantalisingly Close".</h3>
<p> 
 Many of the barriers that currently hinder access to electronic
 book reading platforms by people with disabilities are easily
 correctable by altering the implementation of existing
 technologies, according to a new report.
</p>
<p> 
 The best practice guide on e-book accessibility was produced
 for the publishing industry by the Publishers Licensing Society
 and JISC TechDis, the disability and technology advisory
 agency for the education sector. Findings in the guide - which
 form part of a lengthier full report on the research - are based
 on the results of accessibility testing of e-book platforms
 carried out in 2009 by disability charity the Shaw Trust.
</p>
<p> 
 Disabled technology users tested a number of platforms for
 compatibility with screen-readers; voice recognition; keyboard
 commands; and colour contrast and magnification.
</p>
<p> 
 Alistair McNaught, senior advisor at JISC TechDis, told E-
 Access Bulletin two of the research findings are particularly
 significant. &quot;The first was how tantalisingly close we are to
 solutions; there are still barriers on many platforms but most of
 these are legacies or oversights that could be easily fixed in
 subsequent developments.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The second was the positive engagement from the publishers
 and their responses to the feedback. Good accessibility leads to
 good products and the opportunity for disability organisations
 to be 'expert partners' can only benefit everyone.&quot;

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three: Focus- Digital Exclusion.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Exclusion Zoneby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 The concept of 'digital exclusion' might seem simple enough,
 but it is actually a highly complex field to define and analyse,
 and academics and policymakers are divided on the best ways
 to address it, a City University, London seminar heard last
 week.
</p>
<p> 
 'Digital inclusion and social exclusion: is there a relationship
 and what are the policy implications?' was addressed by Ellen
 Helsper, lecturer in media and communications at the London
 School of Economics and Political Science.
</p>
<p> 
 Across the UK, and the whole developed world, the proportion
 of people not using the internet seems to be levelling off at
 between 20%-30%, Helsper said. Academics had developed
 four broad theory types covering the effects of digital
 exclusion, and how important a factor it is in social exclusion
 more generally, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The first is that it has little or no effect, although this was not a
 widely-held or popular theory, not least because if true, it
 would render large swathes of government policy and
 academic research meaningless, Helsper said.
</p>
<p> 
 The second, 'equalising' theory holds that the reduction of
 digital exclusion reduces disadvantage by engaging people
 more in areas like education. &quot;Sadly, there is not much
 evidence for this&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The third theory is that of 'neutralisation'. This suggests that
 technology use in itself cannot significantly improve people's
 social situation, but for those who do not use it, the social gap
 will widen, so digital inclusion is needed simply to maintain
 &quot;the status quo of inequality&quot;. There is more evidence for this
 theory, Helsper said.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally comes the bleakest theory of all: that of the 'vicious
 cycle'. According to this theory, &quot;Even if we engage everyone
 with technology, the way in which we engage is so different
 that the gaps will still widen, because the socially
 disadvantaged will not use the internet for uses such as
 education but for uses like gaming, so the gaps get bigger and
 bigger.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Whatever the implications, it is clear that over time, the
 relationship between social disadvantage and use of the
 internet has remained stable, so patterns of internet use closely
 track patterns of social deprivation, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Across Europe, we also find that areas of low take-up and use
 are poorer areas, and so the main theories relating to causes of
 digital exclusion (rather than their effects) tend to revolve
 around cost, Elsper said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, if you talk to people in these areas, you receive a
 more complex response about the reasons for their non-use of
 the internet such as discrimination faced by certain sections of
 the community. Theoreticians and policymakers are therefore
 now trying to look beyond the economic indicators, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 It is also becoming clearer that different types of access are
 better for different types of excluded groups, for example that
 home access is better than access in a library or other public
 place, because people have time to play around with it more.
</p>
<p> 
 But levels of home access are again linked to all traditional
 indicators of social exclusion such as disability, Helsper said.
 Among the disabled population, 59% do not have home
 access, compared with just 29% of the general population.
</p>
<p> 
 Accordingly, the focus of analysts has switched towards
 models that go beyond access and use into areas like skills,
 confidence, attitude and motivation, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;People have started thinking differently about skills: they are
 not just asking how good at it people think they are, but are
 looking at things like critical online skills - whether people
 know how good an information source is - or creative skills,
 can you create content online?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 When it comes to confidence levels, we find that people with
 disabilities have lower scores, Helsper said. And the same is
 true for attitude and motivation, which looks at whether people
 see the value of using digital technologies even after they have
 the necessary access and skills: the average score for positive
 attitude stands at 3.1 out of 5 for disabled adults compared to
 3.3 for non-disabled adults; and 3.4/5 for disabled teenagers
 compared with 3.8/5 for non-disabled teenagers.
</p>
<p> 
 An even newer measure of exclusion is that of digital
 'engagement', she said. This measures not just whether people
 have access to the internet, or have the skills or even the
 motivation to use it for sustained periods of time, but how
 deeply they use it and in what ways - do they use it for a wide
 variety of activities?
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It is a parallel argument to that of education: people are now
 saying we need to focus on the ways people are becoming
 engaged. Engagement views activity in a more social
 environment, geared around technologies - people exchanging
 information with each other, for example. It is not something
 that you have to do.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 There are controversies inherent in this kind of analysis,
 Helsper said, because it often can seem to involve value
 judgments as to what type of online activity is more valuable
 than another kind.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There is a tendency to talk about digital participation, but I
 don't really like that term because it comes from the area of
 civic participation, the old view of the value of doing
 something active in society, but in fact if kids do gaming or
 social networks, they may be included.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;But I don't use digital inclusion any more as a term, either -
 what I tend to be talking about now is digital engagement.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The opposite - disengagement - may sometimes be related to
 the fact that not much content is available for some social
 groups, &quot;because the internet was created by stereotypical
 white middle-aged men&quot;. For example the types of jobs some
 people may be looking for may not be widely advertised on
 internet job sites.
</p>
<p> 
 Ultimately, of the three main popular current theories
 mentioned at the opening of the seminar - equalising,
 neutralisation and vicious cycle - it is fair to say that all are
 true in some measure or other or at some time or other,
 depending on the type of engagement, or type of group you are
 looking at, Helsper said.
</p>
<p> 
 There are other encouraging signs, however, such as 'proxy
 use': research shows that one third of non-users have
 somebody else who uses the internet for them, so they are part
 of networks which allow them access to the technology, she
 said. People with disabilities tend to rely on children for proxy
 use, whereas people without disabilities tend to rely on friends
 or colleagues. &quot;In the health and social service sector, this is an
 important finding&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 Another possible hidden positive is that the benefits of have
 digital access or being engaged may not be easy to measure
 because they may accrue in areas unrelated to the specific
 activity, Elsper said. &quot;So if you use technology in a geography
 class, it may not necessarily improve grades or attendance in
 that class, but it could boost confidence in a completely
 different area.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In this and all areas relating to digital exclusion, empirical
 research is &quot;very much a work in progress&quot;, Helsper said.
</p>
<p> 
 In discussion at the end of the seminar, one delegate summed
 up a key shortfall of any public policy that attempts to address
 digital exclusion purely by providing more people with access
 to the internet.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;If you build hospitals in poor areas, and provide lots of
 doctors in them, it will not necessarily improve people's health
 in that area, that has been shown to be true. The same is true
 about giving people access, it won't necessarily mean they are
 more digitally included.&quot;

 sixth birthday next month, you'll find discussion of
 accessibility at all levels, from beginner to guru.

<p> 
 The site has recently been redesigned and the forum system
 improved. This is still ongoing and you can join in the
 discussions.
