E-Access Bulletin â€“ planned closure and reader appeal


To all readers of E-Access Bulletin:


I am sorry to have to inform you that the publisher of E-Access Bulletin,
Headstar, is no longer in a position to continue producing the newsletter.

We have a proud 15-year history of publication, stretching from January 2000 to
issue 175 in May this year. However for the past year Headstar has reduced in
size, and the newsletter has been published on a largely voluntary basis.

All good things come to an end, and many publications have a limited lifespan,
so this is not an unusual situation, but it is regrettable.

Headstar is open to offers and ideas from any organisation about how E-Access
Bulletin might continue, so please do get in touch if your organisation might
like to take on our valued brand, loyal readership and strong track record and
archive. It may be that an organisation in this space would find it a valuable
addition to their range of services and communications channels.

If so, I look forward to hearing from you. If not, our closure will be confirmed
by the autumn and I will thank you all once more for your loyalty, ideas and
feedback over the years.

Very best wishes,


Dan Jellinek and the Headstar team
