<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE:
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">*1: GOVERNMENT 'LOSING
MOMENTUM' ON DISABILITY.</a></h1>
<p>A government bill that would bring discrimination law more
closely in line with legislation covering race, gender and religion
looks set to be sidelined, E-Access Bulletin has learned.</p>
<p>According to the RNIB, the bill was designed to implement
recommendations made by the Department of Work and Pensions
Disability Rights Task Force (<a href=
"http://www.disability.gov.uk/drtf">http://www.disability.gov.uk/drtf</a>)
and was expected in the Commons during the new parliamentary
session. However, Caroline Ellis of the RNIB said this is now
highly unlikely and the RNIB and Disability Rights Commission will
now lobby sympathetic MPs to sponsor a Private Members Bill.</p>
<p>�When they�re not moving on these issues swiftly, the questions
has to be � why not?� she said. �It�s a big blow. It looks like the
government is losing momentum on disability.�</p>
<p>The government set up the Disability Rights Task Force in 1997
to advise on how to deliver its election pledges to the disabled,
and initially appeared to support its conclusions (<a href=
"http://www.disability.gov.uk/drtf/towards_inclusion">http://www.disability.gov.uk/drtf/towards_inclusion</a>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the new bill was expected to strengthen the
Disability Discrimination Act and Special Educational Needs and
Disability Act, both of which have been criticised by the RNIB and
the Disability Rights Commission (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/drc">http://fastlink.headstar.com/drc</a>).</p>
<p>However, these plans now appear to have been sidelined. And
concern over the slow progress on disability legislation has been
heightened by government plans to replace the Disability Rights
Commission with a single watchdog for all anti-discrimination laws
(see Issue 30, June 2002).</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">*2: LANDMARK SETTLEMENT
FOR E-VOTERS.</a></h1>
<p>The Council of the District of Columbia (<a href=
"http://www.dc.gov">http://www.dc.gov</a>), the local authority
which runs the US capital Washington DC, has settled a legal
dispute with disability campaigners by agreeing to install
accessible voting equipment in all its polling stations by
2004.</p>
<p>The settlement (<a href=
"http://www.aapddc">http://www.aapddc</a>.<br />
org/docs/landmarksettledcvotemach.html) ends a landmark legal
action which claimed that plans for new electronic voting machines
violated the Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>
<p>The local authority had planned to introduce an optical
vote-counting system that required voters to mark ballot papers
with a pencil. However, a coalition that included the American
Association of People with Disabilities (<a href=
"http://www.aapd-dc.org">http://www.aapd-dc.org</a>) and the
Disability Rights Council of Greater Washington argued that the
equipment prevented people with impaired vision and motor skills
from voting in secrecy.</p>
<p>In each polling station the authorities will now provide a
voting machine with both audio and touch-screen capability. For a
visually impaired person, the machines produce an audio reading of
the ballot through headphones. Voters select a candidate using
arrow keys identified in Braille, while the touch-screen can be
accessed with any part of the hand or a mouth stick. Voters can
also spell the names of candidates by saying letters out loud.</p>
<p>The new machines will be demonstrated in local elections this
autumn, but will not be used to cast actual votes until 2004.</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">*3: AND THE WINNER IS . .
.</a></h1>
<p>Accessible web sites are being recognised for the first time
this year at the annual Interactive Entertainment Awards of the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA - <a href=
"http://www.bafta.org">http://www.bafta.org</a>).</p>
<p>The judges will present the award to entertainment or
information sites which best exemplify a 'design for all'
approach.</p>
<p>BAFTA awards administrator Duncan Best said that in future the
accessibility criterion might be applied to all entries into the
competition. At present, however, media such as digital television,
mobile phones and text messaging cannot be judged on this basis.
"The technology is not going to be here for the next year and a
half," Best said.</p>
<p>RNIB campaigns officer Julie Howell, one of the award's judges,
said: "RNIB hopes BAFTA will incorporate accessibility into
essential judging criteria for every category in 2003.
Accessibility effects everyone at some time, so the issue should be
regarded as mainstream."</p>

accessibility award - the UK Audio Network; I-Map; Foodlink; and

<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">*4: SEARCH THE WEB BY
EMAIL.</a></h1>
<p>A service allowing people to use highly accessible text email to
search the web using the popular search engine 'Google' has had
nearly 60,000 users in the five months since its launch.</p>
<p>The bulk of those using the service are likely to have done so
because the smaller connection time it requires means searching is
cheaper or because it enables them to search easily using handheld
devices.</p>
<p>However, the service has found favour among blind people, who
find their screen readers work better with text email than the
Google web page.</p>
<p>One frequent user told E-Access Bulletin, "I have used it quite
a lot, but then I also find the web page quite easy to use also."
He did however find fault with the system because it only returns
up to about 20 matches.</p>
<p>The service is run by web software firm Cape Clear (<a href=
"http://www.capeclear.com">http://www.capeclear.com</a>). To use

<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">*5: A MEDAL FOR BILL
GATES.</a></h1>
<p>Micorsoft founder Bill Gates was awarded a Louis Braille Gold
Medal in Toronto last month in recognition of Microsoft Canada's
support for a digital library system developed by the Canadian
National Institute for the Blind (CNIB - <a href=
"http://www.cnib.ca/library">http://www.cnib.ca/library</a>).
Development will begin on the system in October, and it is hoped to
be fully functional within a year.</p>
<p>The project includes development of a Children's Discovery
Portal � an online community for visually impaired children
consisting of the CNIB library, accessible games, a community area
and a news section. Using audio and voice technology, children will
be able to search the library database and download materials, play
games and chat with other visually impaired and sighted
children.</p>
<p>Independent accessibility consultant Joe Clark, who attended the
presentation, said: �The award was deserved, but Bill Gates
shouldn't have been the recipient; it should have been the
Microsoft accessibility group.</p>
<p>"Interestingly though, Bill did commit to spending the rest of
his career advancing the needs of blind people. Perhaps we should
hold him to that?�</p>
<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">*6: 'TALKING LINK'
POSTPONES LAUNCH.</a></h1>
<p>Talking Link, a project developing technology for accessible
internet services including innovative audio and search
capabilities (see EAccess Bulletin, March 2002), has postponed its
September launch due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>The project's Lanacashire-based former owner, the Link Group,
went into voluntary liquidation in August. A new company formed to
take on the work, Deck12, remains confident in the strength of its
portal technology and is continuing to seek new funding. It is also
keen to begin development work on an accessible games project.</p>
<p>�The idea is to develop accessible games that are also
interesting to � for want of a better word � 'ordinary' people,�
said Deck12 spokesman Richard Buchanan. �But in total, we�ve
invested a quarter of a million pounds of our own money in the
technology and we need financial backing if we are to move
forward."</p>
<p>The company has formed a partnership with Disability World
(<a href=
"http://www.disabilityworld.com">http://www.disabilityworld.com</a>),
a provider of online guides and healthcare information for the
disabled.</p>

writes in with some comments on our story on a digital speech and
voice solution to television programme guides (see �Open vista for
digital television�, Story 3, E-Access Bulletin, August 2002).
<p>�Being totally without eyesight myself, I was interested in this
project, but the implications go far beyond television. I have long
hoped that someone would develop a �common box� for analysing
digital displays on such equipment as treadmills and other
gymnasium devices, digital radios, fridge-freezers, other household
items and, of course, television.</p>
<p>�Manufacturers continue to develop flat, smooth touch pads for
those with sight to access numbers, letters and instructions. I am
assured by others that such pads do not in any sense make the final
products more beautiful in their appearance, so this gives me a
small hope that such things will be dropped one day in
acknowledgment of those who cannot read them.</p>
<p>�Cynically, however, I have to admit that I am probably wrong
because, vision being our most powerful sense, it follows logically
that most things will be developed with the eye in mind.�</p>

<h1><a name="section-19." id="section-19.">* OUT OF THE
GHETTO.</a></h1>
by Kevin Carey <a href=
"mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a>
<p>The RNIB's campaign for good web design recently hosted a debate
in London on web accessibility and usability. I wasn't there, but I
understand that the assembled panel of 'experts' were split over
the question as to whether a site can be designed to meet all needs
or whether blind and visually impaired people need a place of their
own, a text ghetto.</p>
<p>It seems from the outside that these experts, like most web
designers, know a heap about what they do themselves, but nothing
about the market for which they are supposed to be doing it. Of
those who could be registered legally blind in the United Kingdom,
only a fraction - certainly less than ten per cent - totally rely
on braille or audio and have no residual vision. And that is quite
apart from those with vision better than 6/60 who are classified as
partially sighted.</p>
<p>All of these people - the vast majority of the RNIB client base
- need an environment in which text, audio and yes, pictures, are
mutually supportive. So are we to stick with "the text, the whole
text and nothing but the text" or go for a new slogan: "Multimedia
must be multimodal"?</p>
<p>I suggest the latter. When people with standard sight and
hearing sit in front of a television they don't choose a primary
receptive medium, turning off either the sound or the picture, so
why should people with poor vision be any different?</p>
<p>On the other hand they might find, on occasion, that they want
text so large that they shift the picture off the screen, or
conversely, they might be grateful for a graph which shows a broad
trend, saving them acres of technical text.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the root of this controversy there is one
massive fallacy: that hypertext is just a minor digital variant on
analogue text. The basic concepts behind hypertext are not new �
indeed it could be argued that they were developed as far back as
the 1690s by Gottfried Leibniz, one of the first thinkers to
conceive of a perfect language which obeyed logical principles and
in which sentences were conceptually interlinked. It is staggering,
therefore, that most contemporary web designers and users don't
understand what it is, and still, for example, array options in
trees and menus. This approach is anathema to the basic concept of
hypertext, which is that one item can have a wide variety of
attributes.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind that I advocate building web sites using
the plasticity of hypertext to allow blind and visually impaired
people to choose what they want instead of shunting them off into
an informational and psychological ghetto.</p>
<p>If you want to see how useless this ghetto strategy can be you
only have to try to read the BBC Home Page with a screen reader.
Last time I looked it had 103 live links, more than half of which
had to be trawled through before I reached the links for the main
channels. It's difficult to beat a good top line legend to help you
jump around a page and this is much better for people with poor
vision than shunting them off into a world of black and white.</p>
<p>On top of the ridiculous architectural metaphor of web 'sites'
and the printing metaphor of 'pages' we now have the even sillier
'one size fits all' proposition.</p>
<p>The whole point about the web and its rendering in digital
technologies is that there isn't one size but only, in the first
instance, the author's preferred rendering. Indeed, splitting style
from content and using a browser is a quintessential exercise in
user preferenced rendering, so what is this debate about?</p>
<p>Not for the first time, it is really a power game between
liberals and authoritarians, between those who make their living by
telling people what to do and those who make their living by making
it possible for people to do things. I know which side I'm on.</p>

LEARNING.</a></h1>

<p>Along with all the other concerns of a newly-enrolled student,
visually impaired people entering university must also ensure they
have the technical and personal support they need.</p>
<p>To assist them, a network of 34 specialist access centres has
been established across the country. These offer independent
assessment for students wanting to apply for the disabled students
allowance (DSA) which helps pay for training and assistive
technologies needed to complete their studies.</p>
<p>The DSA can total up to 4,300 pounds as an assistive hardware
and software allowance over the duration of a course, but this is
largely dependent on the assessment report drawn up by the access
centres and sent to the local education authority. The authority
will then either fund the recommended assistance themselves or
issue funding direct to the individual if they are eligible.</p>
<p>More than 1,250 visually impaired students entered university in
the last academic year.</p>
<p>Maxine Kemp, administrator at the National Federation of Access
Centres (NFAC - <a href=
"http://www.nfac.org.uk">http://www.nfac.org.uk</a>) says: �When a
student applies to university and indicates they have a disability,
the admissions department will inform the disability service and we
would then invite them to their local centre and if necessary,
apply for the DSA for them.�</p>
<p>The centres assess the needs of each individual, covering
everything from the equipment a student will need to technology
training and personal support. The centres undertake 75 per cent of
all disability assessments in England and Wales. The remaining 25
per cent are assessed by private organisations.</p>
<p>Sussex University is one example of an institution with an
access centre set up on campus. The centre here was established
with funding set up in memory of Sally Marriott, the University's
former deputy personnel manager who dedicated much of her career to
helping students with disabilities.</p>
<p>In 2000 a new Visual Impairment Unit was established at Sussex
with funding from the University and the Blatchington Court Trust
(<a href=
"http://freespace.virgin.net/blatchington.court">http://freespace.virgin.net/blatchington.court</a>),
a local charity promoting education and employment for visually
impaired young people in Sussex. Last year the unit assessed 23
visually impaired students from all over the country who were
looking to attend a university in the South.</p>
<p>The centre's assessor Argie Labib, who is himself visually
impaired, said the assessments help different people in different
ways. �Nearly all visually impaired students work with computers
and we can recommend things for their studies. Some are not aware
of what�s available and we have access to all the latest technology
and carry out research to find out what works with what and what
doesn�t work.�</p>
<p>One student who has been helped by an access centre is Saqib
Shaikh, who lost his sight when he was seven years old and is in
his second year at Essex university studying as an undergraduate in
Computer Science. The Middlesex access centre carried out his
initial assessment and sent it to the disability support unit in
Essex University who signed and verified it and helped him in many
ways.</p>
<p>�Our disability coordinator, while she has little money to spend
on disability, is very helpful and will always try to do her best
to get the right things done. She listens to what I want, and tries
to provide it, and there's no bureaucracy and red tape to get
through,� says Shaikh.</p>
<p>�Being a computer scientist, I just told them what I needed, and
they agreed. They also helped me interview potential readers, and a
nonacademic helper for laundry, shopping and so on. They liaised
with the Computer Science department to make them aware of the
situation. They help by sorting out applying for DSA - the
university pays and then claims it back from the local education
authority.�</p>
<p>Shaikh uses scanning software to read books and letters, a note
taker for making notes and a four-track tape recorder for listening
to taped text books. He relies on his computer for work, internet
research and communicating by email. �I couldn't exist without it,�
he says.</p>

<h1><a name="section-23." id="section-23.">* LOVE GROWS OVER THE
WIRES.</a></h1>
by Estelita Clayton
<p>My story started over 40 years ago when, at the age of 18 months
old, I lost my sight.</p>
<p>Living in the Philippines and going through school was very
difficult with no technology aids to help me cope with my studies,
but I successfully graduated and earned a college degree in
teaching. With the help of generous people I was able to get a job
as a schoolteacher by teaching Braille to blind children.</p>
<p>Later on I got married and my husband, who was also blind, took
me to live in Canada, where the way of living was different. There
I learnt how to use a computer with an early voice synthesis
machine called DECtalk (<a href=
"http://www.fonix.com/products/dectalk">http://www.fonix.com/products/dectalk</a>)
and JAWS software. As a first timer, I found my computer amazing as
it can do wonders. It fired my interest to learn more and enjoy
finding new things that I could do.</p>
<p>After a short time, I lost my husband. I was left alone, and
having to rely on a few friends to help me when they could, I was
very lonely. I had my computer to use to while away the time. I
started working on correspondence courses from Hadley School for
the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.hadley-school.org">http://www.hadley-school.org</a>).
The tutors were very helpful.</p>
<p>Then I ventured out on to the internet and found it interesting.
I made internet friends to chat with till I found a pen pal from
thousands of miles away in the UK to exchange email with. With his
help online I learned more how to navigate around the web and found
many new things to do with computers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I decided to take a year long course at college. By
this time, I had progressed from the desktop to a laptop, which
gave me more freedom and confidence to go through college. My pen
pal was still there online to help me with my computer related
problems and to teach me some of my course's assignments. I called
him my 'techie guy'. By the time I was halfway to finish my course,
we realised we were falling in love with each other and decided to
meet after I finished the school. When the school was over I had
passed the course with excellent grades. The long awaited time for
me to meet my techie guy was over and soon I was on my way to meet
him.</p>
<p>By September 2001 we were married and enjoying our life together
and learning more about computers. My guy is sighted so he has
learnt how to use all types of different programs with Access
Technology and then teaches me how to do it. I continued with the
Hadley courses and one of the courses I took recently was
Introduction to Personal Computer, which I earned excellent grade
of A+. So I am learning more each day.</p>
<p>Technology has helped to change my life for the better, without
it my life would have been very different. I can only imagine life
will get even better in the future for the visually impaired and
the deafblind.</p>
