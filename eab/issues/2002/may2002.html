<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">*SECTION ONE:
NEWS</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* MULTIMEDIA TO THE RESCUE
OF BRAILLE?</a></h1>
<p>Blind children should be taught Braille in a rich multimedia
environment, an international group of experts concluded at a
conference held in Copenhagen last month.</p>
<p>The symposium, entitled �Braille in the age of digitisation�
(<a href=
"http://www.ibos.dk/braille">http://www.ibos.dk/braille</a>), was
convened to examine how digital technologies could be harnessed to
reverse the declining use of Braille. According to a study by the
US National Federation of the Blind, Braille literacy levels in
both the US and UK have fallen from more than 50 per cent 40 years
ago to less than 10 per cent now (<a href=
"http://www.nfb.org/braille/brustoc.htm">http://www.nfb.org/braille/brustoc.htm</a>).</p>
<p>RNIB vice chairman Kevin Carey, who representated the institute
in Copenhagen, said the internet has an important role to play in
stimulating the uptake of Braille. �One of the reasons that
children are keen to read print is to gain access to what is
forbidden, but Braille content is almost entirely prescribed, so
they lose interest,� he said.</p>
<p>Delegates also passed a resolution to encourage Braille
production houses to pool their resources to form a unified Braille
research laboratory. The unified body, they said, should aim to
develop affordable tools that can render internet content in both
standard and advanced Braille grades. Carey said the common policy
of encouraging people to learn the sophisticated grade two Braille
irrespective of their needs has not helped: �Learning grade two is
hard: blind people have enough problems anyway, and many will think
- why add one more?�</p>
<p>The conference agreed, however, that the unified approach would
have limits, and that specialist Braille notations needed for
mathematics, music and engineering should continue to be produced
by specialist production houses.</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* OBJECTIONS RAISED OVER
E-VOTING TRIAL.</a></h1>
<p>Objections have been raised about the inaccessibility of one of
the electronic voting trials held alongside this month�s local
council elections.</p>
<p>The Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions
held a series of e-voting pilots in nine local authority areas in
England - Bolton, Chester, Borough of Crewe and Nantwich,
Liverpool, Newham, Sheffield, St Albans, Stratford upon Avon and
Swindon. The trials included internet voting from home, voting
kiosks and mobile text messaging.</p>
<p>In Sheffield, 36 per cent of those who voted did so
electronically through the Sheffield e-Vote 2002 gateway (<a href=
"http://www.votesheffield.com">http://www.votesheffield.com</a>).
However Julian Scarlett, web design officer for the education
department at Sheffield which was not involved in the pilot, told
the international Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI � <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>) email list this
month: �Although I applaud the project [for] those who find
traditional voting methods hard to access, I am dismayed at the
accessibility of the site; no alt text, no table summaries, no
natural language declaration for body text, no labels for form
elements, absolute font sizes�.</p>
<p>The Sheffield trial was run with private sector partners BT and
Election.com. Charel Aoun, technical director of Election.com,
admitted that the web gateway used to access the online voting
system wasn�t run through the standard accessibility checker, Bobby
as there was no time. However, he told E-Access Bulletin that the
voting engine itself was accessible. �The engine conforms with WAI
guidelines up to level 3 � in this pilot we missed a couple of
details but it definitely is level 2. The project was a pilot and
we�ll take on board any glitches and work to improve them in
future.�</p>
<p>Meanwhile disability organisation Scope (<a href=
"http://www.scope.org.uk">http://www.scope.org.uk</a>) is calling
for feedback on the accessibility of the postal ballot or e-voting
pilots during the local elections for a report commissioned by the
Electoral Commission. For a survey form or more information call

<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* LOCAL GOVERNMENT SITE
WINS �SEE IT RIGHT� AWARD.</a></h1>
<p>IDeA Knowledge (<a href=
"http://www.idea.gov.uk/knowledge">http://www.idea.gov.uk/knowledge</a>),
a web portal on e-government in the UK developed by the local
government Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA), is the first
local government site to pass an audit for the RNIB �See It Right�
web accessibility campaign. The central government portal UK Online
(<a href=
"http://www.ukonline.gov.uk">http://www.ukonline.gov.uk</a>) has
already qualified for an award.</p>
<p>The IDeA Knowledge site aims to share insights and practices
with policy makers and practitioners in local government through
workshops, toolkits, case studies and online communities. According
to IDeA, the site now sets a standard for accessibility that local
authorities should try to emulate.</p>
<p>Although IDeA cannot impose accessibility standards, it warns
that local authorities cannot ignore them. �If they do they�re
going to be in trouble: if some local authorities are seen to be
coasting or doing badly while others are doing well, people will
start asking questions,� an agency spokesperson told E-Access
Bulletin.</p>
<p>According to the RNIB, the �See It Right� campaign is a major
step forward because awards for web sites are based on an
independent human audit, unlike software-based approaches like
Bobby (<a href=
"http://www.cast.org/bobby">http://www.cast.org/bobby</a>), or
World Wide Web Consortium guidelines, which provide a set of
standards for accessibility, but no checks on compliance. To date,
the RNIB has only audited a handful of sites, but expects to deal
with a further 50 sites from across the private and public sectors
in the next six months.</p>
<p>The RNIB says projects like the London-based Accessible and
Personalised Local Authority Websites initiative (APLAWS - <a href=
"http://www.aplaws.org.uk">http://www.aplaws.org.uk</a>) represent
the next important step in making government web sites more
accessible to visually impaired people. APLAWS is run by a
consortium of councils developing a content management system that
will standardise the way content is laid out and navigated on
council web sites.</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* WRITING COMPETITION -

<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* SHOPPING OUT
LOUD.</a></h1>
<p>A voice-activated shopping centre has been added to the services
offered by Freedom Network (<a href=
"http://www.freedombox.info">http://www.freedombox.info</a>), a
USbased internet portal aimed at people unable to use graphical
user interfaces.</p>
<p>Online book shop Amazon (<a href=

SITUATION: Larry Johnson from Texas</a></h1>
writes: �The US National Library Service (NLS) maintains a web site
with listings for books in Braille and recorded from organisations
in the US, Canada and Great Britain. But when I asked my regional
library for the blind in Austin, Texas for their assistance in
borrowing a book from the UK National Library for the Blind, they
told me they have no arrangements for doing so.
<p>�I was shocked. Why are these listings on the NLS website? They
replied that the website was also for the use of sighted
librarians, and that these folks might have special access or
arrangements with those lending organisations. Frankly, this makes
little sense to me. Is there a way for a blind person in the US to
borrow books from Braille libraries in the UK?� [Responses to

<h1><a name="section-17." id="section-17.">* WARNING SIGNAL: Our
regular reader and correspondent David</a></h1>
Porter writes in to ask for advice on behalf of a friend of his who
is registered blind. �Since she has retinitis pigmentosa, she has
tunnel vision. As the condition develops, the tunnel will become
narrower. When shopping in the supermarket, no matter how carefully
she uses the shopping trolley, she bumps into other people.
<p>�I wonder if any reader knows of a gadget (perhaps a battery
operated unit with flashing light, with a bleeper - although this
could alert potential thieves to her disability) or maybe an
adaptation of the gadgets now built into cars, which warns drivers
when they are moving too close to another vehicle, or other
obstruction. If you've never seen one of these, they emit rapid
bleeps, which increase in volume as the "closing distance"
decreases - warning the driver to stop.</p>
<p>�My friend is also a keen swimmer but, because of her restricted
view, frequently does not see other swimmers until she has bumped
into them. I think electronic warnings would not cope well with
water - any suggestions for this problem as well?� [Responses to

<h1><a name="section-18." id="section-18.">* UNIFIED MATHEMATICS:
Susan Jolly from Los Alamos, New</a></h1>
Mexico, writes: �I am a sighted computational scientist in the US
with an interest in Braille mathematics, and ran across your recent
informative article on the subject (see issue 25, January 2002).
<p>�What is actually happening regarding a possible Braille
unification is that there is a proposal to make a new Braille code
for maths that would be very similar to the current UK one and
completely unlike the Nemeth code used here in the States. (These
two codes are so different there is no way to merge them or come up
with a compromise). This proposal has been designed mainly by
non-technical persons. Naturally, the technical Braille readers
here have very negative views about simply discarding what they
feel to be a better code than the one used in the UK.</p>
<p>�I would love to correspond with someone who actually uses the
UK Braille maths code in order to learn their opinion on the
proposed 'unification' which is supposed to be voted on next year.�

</ul>
<h1><a name="section-20." id="section-20.">* FIRST CLASS
SERVICE.</a></h1>
by Dan Jellinek <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a>
<p>The St Dunstan�s charity for blind ex-servicepeople (<a href=
"http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk">http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk</a>)
was founded in 1915 by the newspaper proprietor Sir Arthur Pearson,
who was himself blind. Pearson wanted to support the many men and
women being blinded in the First World War, often by mustard gas.
As time has passed and major conflicts become less frequent, the
organisation�s remit has been expanded to cover not just injuries
suffered in active service but any sight problems suffered by
ex-servicepeople and their families, including those resulting from
old age.</p>
<p>There are now some 753 �St Dunstaners�, and the charity helps a
further 500 spouses and a similar number of widows and widowers. It
also operates the Diana Gubbay Trust for the benefit of men and
women in the emergency services who become blind.</p>
<p>The charity�s headquarters is in London but its main centre for
rehabilitation work, including computer training, is in Ovingdean,
perched atop imposing white cliffs on the Sussex coast near
Brighton.</p>
<p>Initial training in independent living including access to
computers and other technologies where relevant usually takes place
during residential courses at Ovingdean. Follow-up work takes place
in people�s homes (which are often rented from or part-funded by St
Dunstan�s), and further assistance can include loans for computer
equipment.</p>
<p>The general manager at Ovingdean is Dick Lake, who joined last
year following 35 years in the Navy as head of the service�s social
work department. He is in no doubt of the value and importance of
modern technologies for the sort of rehabilitation work that is
central to people who are blinded or become visually impaired.</p>
<p>�Computers and associated technologies represent a quantum leap
for blind people in terms of their quality of life and access to
employment. In the past people had to learn Braille or Moon,
whereas now they can stick with what they know using a computer
keyboard,� Lake says.</p>
<p>�For older people in particular who are newly visually impaired,
learning a new system like Braille is going to be hard and their
touch sensitivity may have deteriorated so technology is of major
importance.�</p>
<p>The Ovingdean centre is a striking building designed in the
1930s to resemble an aeroplane, with a high glass front echoing a
cockpit and symmetrical wings that follow a standard lay-out on
each floor to make it easy for people with visual impairment to
find their way around.</p>
<p>The technology training centre is in a more modern annexe to the
building and features around a dozen computers with large screens,
plus special printers, scanners and a selection of access software
and hardware including screen reader and screen magnification
software. One of the machines has a CCTV camera linked to it so
people can magnify documents and view them as part of a
split-screen display controlled by a foot pedal.</p>
<p>Technology trainer Janis Sharp says that over the past two years
interest among the older residents and visitors to Ovingdean has
grown rapidly. �At first they said it was for the youngsters but as
the internet continued to receive massive media exposure, and
everything they came across has a �www� address linked with it they
gradually started to come in and ask what it was all about.�</p>
<p>People using the machines now range from an old soldier with an
eyepatch who slowly types out poems with his index finger, to
people accessing machines remotely from as far afield as
Ireland.</p>
<p>St Dunstaners living in the community have access to a telephone
support service for help with computers and peripherals, and Sharp
says it is usually possible to assist people fairly quickly over
the phone since they can listen in to speech messages that the
computer might be outputting. �We had one call recently about a
jammed printer that turned out to be caused by creases in an
envelope. The next day the St Dunstaner asked his housekeeper to
iron all his envelopes.�</p>
<p>There is a swashbuckling feel to much of the activity around St
Dunstan�s, as one might expect from an organisation working with
exservicepeople including special forces personnel. St Dunstaners
regularly run in marathons, break motorbike speed records using
radio guidance, ride horses, ski and enter yacht races. Now to
these acts of derring-do a more sedentary but no less adventurous
computer club has been added which meets twice a year to build
machines, discuss the latest technologies and exchange tips.</p>
<p>Technology training can also be the key for ex-servicepeople who
lose their sight to find fulfilling new employment. �Not as many
people find employment as we�d like, as it is hard to get people
back into the workplace�, says Lesley Styche, head of
rehabilitation and training at St Dunstan�s. �But there are St
Dunstaners working as everything from accountants to
hydrotherapists and even at the BBC following computer
courses.�</p>

<h1><a name="section-22." id="section-22.">* Mark Threadgold spent
17 years in the Royal Corps of Signals,</a></h1>
which is responsible for the British Army�s global communications
network, before losing his sight two years ago after receiving a
severe head injury. He was subsequently helped in his
rehabilitation by the St Dunstan�s organisation for visually
impaired ex-servicepeople (see previous section, this issue) and
writes here on his experiences in learning how to work with
computers once more.
<h1><a name="section-23." id="section-23.">* ENGINEERING A DIGITAL
RECOVERY.</a></h1>
<p>I was extremely lucky to be taken into the family of St
Dunstan�s on leaving hospital. This was the start of a year of
excellent training in mobility, independent living skills such as
cooking, and computer use.</p>
<p>As I had been an electronics engineer prior to losing my sight,
part of my job involved maintenance and repair of desktop PCs. It
was also</p>
<p>something I tried to keep up to date outside work as a hobby.
After my injury I presumed my use of the computer had come to an
end. My introduction to screen-readers was, therefore, an absolute
revelation!</p>
<p>The first stage in the relearning process was to master
touch-typing. After four or five days, and one very patient
teacher, I had the basics sorted out. Plenty of practice saw me
racing round the keyboard with far more confidence than competence!
My total lack of sight meant this device was to become my only
method of both control and data input.</p>
<p>Having developed enough confidence to go a little further I had
my own computer brought up to St Dunstan�s. The HAL screen reader
from Dolphin Computer Access<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/products/hal.htm">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/products/hal.htm</a>)
was installed for me so with this set up in my room I could
practice all night if I so wished. Getting to grips with the
different applications was the next logical step. Microsoft Word 97
had previously been my choice of word processor and this is where
we started. Finding commands through the drop down menus quickly
became a chore. Shortcut keys were the faster option, if only I
could remember them all. While attempting to find a list of these
in the help file I was told they had already been printed off. As
it was sixteen pages of A4 long I decided that maybe shortcut keys
were not for me and resigned myself to using the drop down
menus.</p>
<p>I believe my previous experience with the programs helped a lot.
As I could remember the various dialogue boxes and their layout it
made explaining them to me simpler. This theory was reinforced when
I was asked a question by another St Dunstaner, who was almost two
generations my senior and had never previously seen computers. At
the dinner table he asked, "What is the cursor?" I thought about
this for quite some time! How on earth do you describe what a
cursor is to someone who has never seen one? We had a hilarious
discussion about the little flashing capital �I� that shows you
where your typing is going to appear. Getting across that this
moved by itself each time you pressed a key must have made it sound
like black magic. I spent the next week praying that nobody would
introduce him to the mouse!</p>
<p>Other applications came along quickly. I would experiment with
my own computer in the evenings and ask how to fix it the following
day! They say you learn by your mistakes, and I made plenty of
learning opportunities. The various applications now required
different devices to work. Setting up the printer and modem were
simple enough. The internal telephone system did not like being
dialled out through with the standard modem so I had my mobile
phone soft modem installed. With this I got my web account settings
put back in and started using email again. I am a huge fan of the
internet and was now in touch with some of my friends again using
it. Utilities such as the web search tool Webferret (<a href=
"http://www.zdnet.com/ferret">http://www.zdnet.com/ferret</a>) and
the file compressor Winzip (<a href=
"http://www.winzip.com">http://www.winzip.com</a>) were
re-installed and learned again. Customising desktop settings and
making up shortcut keys to launch programs was all refreshed.</p>
<p>One major leap in independence I found was through text reading
software that works with a scanner to read printed text. After
being introduced to the Cicero application, again from Dolphin
Computer Access (<a href=
"http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/products/cicero.htm">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk/products/cicero.htm</a>),
I could read my post simply and privately with the press of a
single key. This did, of course, assume you had the text facing
downwards on the scanner! I lost count of the times I was told the
page on the scanner was blank. This led to a simple method of
marking papers by turning down the top left corner of the page as I
took it out of the envelope. I still use this technique with
documents I print or receive through the post.</p>
<p>With my background in engineering my thoughts now turned to
future employment. After a long search a local IT training company
was found, and after a visit to introduce them to the screen reader
and present myself as blind but mostly sane, they agreed to take me
on a course. I am now midway through a Microsoft Certified System
Engineer (MCSE) course with them for networking with Windows
2000.</p>
<p>This is proving very interesting as well as challenging. The
main challenge is not with the computers, but with the course
textual information. We all forgot I couldn't read the two inch
thick books that form the course material! If the staff of St
Dunstans hadn't done such a good job with the early training I
would not have this problem now!</p>

<p>Speech-processing professionals often point to the 'voice web'
as the key to achieving the goal of developing content that is
accessible anytime, anywhere and on any device.</p>
<p>The voice web has been defined in various ways. At its core, it
possible to access content on the internet by voice, with speech
input and output providing part or all of the human interface. The
channel can be wired, but is expected to be primarily wireless, and
voice web input devices extend from standard telephones to future
generations of multi-purpose, internet-enabled devices.</p>
<p>Excitement about the voice web is predicated on continued strong
growth of the internet, and global wireless deployments, and of the
bonding of those two technologies. The Gartner Group, for example,
has projected that the number of mobile phones deployed worldwide
will exceed one billion before 2005 and has indicated that it
expects 80 per cent of new handheld devices will feature some form
of internet connection.</p>
<p>Another force driving the voice web is the formation of
standards, most importantly VoiceXML. This standard sets out the
grammar that will be used in interpreting speech and the XML
extensions needed to create the voice web applications of today.
VoiceXML's power lies in its sponsorship by the World Wide Web
Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>) and
the widespread commitment from speech technology companies, non-
government and industry.</p>
<p>The VoiceXML Forum (<a href=
"http://www.voicexml.org">http://www.voicexml.org</a>), an industry
organisation founded by AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent and Motorola, is
working on extensions to the standard designed to support the next
generation of input devices. It is not alone. In October 2001,
Microsoft, Cisco, Comverse, Intel, Philips and speech technology
specialist SpeechWorks announced the Speech Applications Language
Tags initiative (SALT - <a href=
"http://www.saltforum.org">http://www.saltforum.org</a>). SALT will
formulate XML extensions for incorporating speech into future
generations of input devices capable of true multi-modal
communication.</p>
<p>All of this work is designed to move the industry and the
marketplace closer to anytime, anywhere, any device capabilities.
This goal is achievable eventually, although voice web applications
that are moving into the mainstream today are still at the earliest
stage of evolution. They are highly constrained in the content
which can be accessed, because interaction is menu oriented,
designed primarily for standard telephones and often operating in
only one language.</p>
<p>Having said that, consumers can already use voice portals to
access weather information, find the nearest Starbucks or hear what
is playing at local cinemas. Unified messaging systems provide
mobile professionals and others with a single access point for
voicemail, email and fax. Corporate customer relationship
management (CRM) systems, such as the one deployed by car
maintenance company JiffyLube (<a href=
"http://www.jiffylube.com">http://www.jiffylube.com</a>), is
starting to offer customers appointment scheduling and service
alerts. Voice application networks within enterprises give sales
reps and other mobile professionals access to a combination of the
web and corporate data sources, including unified messaging and
access to customer data.</p>
<p>Many first-stage voice web applications of today look beyond
standard telephones. In warehouses and factories, speech
input/output is achieved through wearable devices and
radio-frequency transmission. The voice application network
technology has already extended the reach of those systems to
support just-in-time and ecommerce ordering systems. In-vehicle
systems, such as the OnStar Virtual Advisor (<a href=
"http://www.onstar.com">http://www.onstar.com</a>), embedded
far-field microphones to provide many of the same services
available from voice portals and voice application networks.</p>
<p>Distributed speech technology is enabling next-generation PDAs
(personal digital assistants), such as Compaq's iPaq, to access a
range of services from the voice web, including dictation and
unified messaging. Compact voice biometrics are being embedded into
toys and cell phones. They are also being put onto smart-cards for
point-ofsale speaker authentication.</p>
<p>The voice web is not the only category of application moving the
industry closer to anytime, anywhere, any device access. The
ability to use advanced dictation technology in combination with
information retrieval tools, and sometimes with text-independent
speaker identification, has made it possible to add audio and
audiovisual sources (news broadcasts, calls to a call centre,
movies) to the content that can be mined for information. This
constellation of technologies is called audio-mining or
audio-indexing. Prior to its deployment, indexing of audio sources
required a great deal of time-consuming manual labour.</p>
<p>Today, it is possible to index, search and retrieve information
from large databases of audio and audiovisual sources in near real
time. For example, it would be possible to index and search
yesterday's CNN broadcasts for questions, such as "What did George
W Bush say about Saddam Hussein?" It is also possible for a call
centre supervisor to search last month's calls for all comments
about a specific product.</p>
<p>Many of the advances and trends described above are available
commercially by virtue of advances in the computing and
communications infrastructures. The very existence of the voice
web, like its name, is derived from the success of the internet.
The Pentium III processor was dubbed "the ASR chip" because its
instructions set supports the kinds of operations needed for
advanced ASR (automated speech recognition). In telecommunications,
2.5G and 3G (third generation) systems promise support for advanced
multi-modal devices. The recent economic downturn has delayed, but
not stopped, this infrastructure evolution.</p>
<p>Sometimes speech acts as an enabling technology. One of the best
examples of this effect is in-vehicle systems. There may still be
discussions about whether speech should be a cornerstone of
telematics, but those discussions are not being held in legislative
bodies. One by one, legislators are climbing on the hands-free
bandwagon.</p>
<p>Their actions have heightened the value of speech as an enabler
of the</p>
<p>office-in-the-car. The rapid "miniaturisation" of mobile phones
and other handheld devices has spawned add-on tools such as
finger-worn pointing tools. None of these tools are as flexible as
talking, making speech an enabling technology for next-generation
handheld devices.</p>
