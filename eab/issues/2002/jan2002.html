<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE -
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* LOCAL AUTHORITY SITES 'A
MIXED BAG'.</a></h1>
<p>This year�s annual review of UK local authority web sites, due
to be published in March by the Society for IT Management, will
include an assessment of 30 council web sites for their
accessibility to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The 30 sites were chosen as among the best-developed and most
�transactional� sites, for example those that allow people to pay
council tax, reserve library books or interact with other local
public services directly over the web.</p>
<p>Overall, the council sites are a mixed bag, E-Access Bulletin
has learned. Problems found include unlabelled graphics; visual
clutter; graphical links; general design and navigational
inconsistencies; the use of frames; the use of �Flash� animation
without alternatives; and problems with text and background
colours.</p>
<p>But many display a good grasp of accessibility including clear,
resizable text; helpful information about how to navigate the site;
pages dedicated to accessibility, and invitations for feedback on
accessibility issues. All in all, council sites are ahead of
commercial sites for accessibility, the report finds.</p>
<p>The accessibility assessments were carried out for SOCITM by the
charity AbilityNet (<a href=
"http://www.abilitynet.co.uk">http://www.abilitynet.co.uk</a>). For
more information and to place an advance order for �Better

<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* MOBILE INDUSTRY TO GUIDE
ITSELF.</a></h1>
<p>UK mobile phone companies have agreed to collaborate to draw up
a list of best practice to help make their services more
accessible, but they will not be seeking the input of external
groups, E-Access Bulletin has learned.</p>
<p>The decision to develop the standards was taken last week at the
inaugural meeting of a new mobile industry acessibility group
attended by the UK's mobile phone operators Vodafone, BT Cellnet,
One2One and Orange (see also E-Access Bulletin, December 2001).</p>
<p>According to the group's chairman Mike Duxbury of Vodafone, the
document will "give an honest overview of where we are now, and
where we will be [in the future]".</p>
<p>The next phase of the drafting process will be a meeting in
April, to which mobile handset manufacturers and suppliers from
outside the UK will also be invited. The input of consumer pressure
groups or of the government telecoms regulator OFTEL will not be
sought, however.</p>
<p>According to Duxbury the presence of pressure groups at such
meetings can be counterproductive. And he said OFTEL was not
forward-looking, and only issued regulation on the basis of "the
technology of yesterday".</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* CLASSIC HEIST MOVIE
CAPTURED IN WORDS.</a></h1>
<p>'Ocean's Eleven', the Warner Brothers remake of a 1960 classic
gangster movie, is set to be the third audio-described film to be
given a trial release in 11 cinemas across the UK in
mid-February.</p>
<p>The move is the latest in a six month trial of a digital
technology called the Cinema Subtitling System made by US-based DTS
(<a href="http://www.dtsonline.com">http://www.dtsonline.com</a> )
which allows cinemas to add an extra soundtrack to a film, in this
case adding descriptions of the action between dialogue for blind
and visually impaired people. The same system can also be used to
superimpose subtitles for the benefit of the hearing-impaired and
foreign language audiences.</p>
<p>An audio described version of fantasy film Harry Potter was
released in December and Rat Race, an all-star road race comedy, is
due out next week. David Mann, an RNIB campaigner who has a small
amount of sight, said following a showing of Harry Potter in
Belfast: "I didn't think Harry Potter was my thing, but I thought
it was brilliant."</p>

<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* CALL FOR EUROPEAN TREATY
REFORM.</a></h1>
<p>Treaty of Europe, the rulebook of the European Union, needs to
be changed to encourage the 'design for all' philosophy for
products and services, including those provided over the internet,
a leading member of the European Parliament has said.</p>
<p>According to Richard Howitt, MEP for the East of England and
President of the All-Party Disability Group of MEPs (<a href=
"http://www.richardhowitt.labour.co.uk">http://www.richardhowitt.labour.co.uk</a>),
declaration 22 of article 95 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the most
recent version of the Treaty of Europe, needs to be made into a
full article of its own.</p>
<p>This change would mean civil servants at the European Commission
were obliged to ensure "institutions of the Community shall take
account of the needs of persons with a disability� rather than
simply being urged to do so, as they are under current rules.
Crucially, the requirement to give this kind of consideration would
extend to standards for products and services made at a European
level.</p>
<p>Howitt's call came at a conference held in Brussels last month
to consider what could be done to encourage designers to adopt the
universal design philosophy. For a full conference report see
section four, this issue.</p>
<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* GOVERNMENT SITE UPDATED,
AT LAST.</a></h1>
<p>The UK government this week unveiled a long-awaited update of
its disability information web site (<a href=
"http://www.disability.gov.uk">http://www.disability.gov.uk</a>),
which it had previously neglected for almost a year (see E-Access
Bulletin, November 2001).</p>
<p>The updated site contains a basic introduction to legislation
protecting disabled people, and links to consultation documents and
information campaigns run by the Department for Work and Pensions
(DWP), the site's owner. One of the most useful new additions is a
free-text search box.</p>
<p>A DWP spokesperson said the site is still under development, and
that the department was committed to making this site as accessible
and easy to use as possible. "We would welcome views on the
accessibility and content of the site," he said.</p>

<h1><a name="section-15." id="section-15.">* BEYOND PENCIL AND
PAPER.</a></h1>
by Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a>
<p>Mathematicians are proud that their discipline has gained so
much influence with the application of just a pencil, paper and a
waste paper basket. But, while these are the accepted tools of the
trade, the dots and squiggles that are the nuts and bolts of
mathematics are largely innaccessible to blind people, whether on
paper or a computer screen.</p>
<p>As Alistair Edwards, a researcher at the department of computer
science at the University of York, told the RNIB's recent Techshare
conference: "There is no reason why blind people cannot do the bit
in the head . . . but they have difficulty with the 'paper'."
Proving this point are the large number of blind people among the
mathematical greats - people such as Leonhard Euler, Nicholas
Saunderson, Lev Pontryagin, Alfred Loewy, Stephen Smale, WG
Bickley, Bernard Morin and Joseph Plateau.</p>
<p>But the achievements of these exceptional individuals cannot
obscure the fact the access problem presented by mathematical
notation is, in the deadpan terminology favoured by mathematicians,
�non-trivial�. A solution to this problem would not only mean a few
more blind people would be able to become mathemeticians and prove
�a sphere could be turned inside-out in a smooth manner�, as Smale
did in 1959, but that many more people would be able to tot up
their gas bill.</p>
<p>The fundamental difficulty faced here is that the reading of
written mathematics depends on interpreting the relative positions
of an enormous array of symbols on a two dimensional surface, while
computer screenreaders and Braille convey their meaning simply by
ordering of relatively limited number of symbols in just one
dimension. To describe mathematical expressions in Braille or for a
screenreader to interpret them requires an extremely complex
codification and translation process.</p>
<p>In the case of Braille, the difficulty of the translation
problem has led to the formation of a number of rival codes, each
with their own loyal band of supporters. This fragmentation means
that, unlike their sighted counterparts, people reading and writing
Braille mathematics are not using a borderless language. To help
resolve this problem there are moves afoot to unite the codes used
in the UK, where a variety are used, with the Nemeth code, which
was made standard in the US in 1952.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of an international standard, Braille is still
the most practical way for most students to perform mathematical
manipulations, just as pencil and paper still beats the computer in
the sighted world of maths. This is because written Braille allows
blind mathematicians to move their fingers from one line to the
next to jog their memories, in the same way as sighted people can
by moving their eyes.</p>
<p>For an account of a frustrated attempt to produce a
computer-based alternative to the old fashioned Brailler, see
Alistair Edwards' 'Access to mathematics' notes:<br />
<a href=
"http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~alistair/Techshare.rtf">http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~alistair/Techshare.rtf</a></p>
<p>But being able to do mathematics alone or just share it with
others using the same Braille code is not enough: to participate
fully in mathematical discourse, blind people need to be able to
access the work of their sighted counterparts. This is where
computers are proving extremely useful, because they too need to be
fed mathematical equations into a one dimensional form, and their
interconnection over the internet is leading to
standardisation.</p>
<p>Mathematicians' wish to communicate mathematical expressions
using plain text email led to the creation in 1985 of the LaTeX
typsetting language (<a href=
"http://www.latex-project.org">http://www.latex-project.org</a>) as
a de-facto standard, mantained by an international working
group.</p>
<p>Useful though it is, LaTeX is not the complete solution for the
blind, however, being rather cumbersome and unintuitive in its raw
form. To make matters worse there is no automated way of converting
it into everyday speech or even standard Braille in the same way as
it can be translated into graphics. It has even been mathematically
proven that it is not possible to develop software to transcribe
every LaTeX formula unambiguously into Braille.</p>
<p>Limited LaTeX-to-Braille translation programs do exist, with one
of the most popular being MegaDots, made by US software company
Duxbury (<a href=
"http://www.duxburysystems.com">http://www.duxburysystems.com</a>).</p>
<p>Partial solutions to the LaTeX-to-speech problem have also been
developed. One of the more recent ones, Audio System for Technical
Reading (ASTER), was developed by blind US-based mathematician 'TV'
Raman. Though it is not openly available a demonstration of ASTER
is available on Raman's web site: <a href=
"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html">
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html</a></p>
<p>Finally, the web standards body World Wide Web Consortium is
engaged in an ongoing programme to create a standard for presenting
mathematical expressions on web pages called MathML (<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Math">http://www.w3.org/Math</a>). This could be
of potential use for visually impaired people, since the consortium
says of its latest release: "MathML 2.0 attempts to capture
something of the meaning behind equations rather than concentrating
entirely on how they are going to be formatted out on the
screen."</p>
<p>A gathering of those with an interest in the development of
MathML is taking place in June this year in Chicago. See: <a href=

<h1><a name="section-16." id="section-16.">* SECTION FOUR:
CONFERENCE REPORT</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>DESIGN FOR ALL.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="section-17." id="section-17.">* MOTIVATING THE
UNIVERSAL DESIGNER.</a></h1>
by Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a>
<p>The European Commission and the European Disability Forum, an
international umbrella lobby group, recently assembled a high-level
'round-table' working group to consider steps that could be taken
to prompt designers of mainstream products and services, including
electronic ones, to consider the needs of people with
disabilities.</p>
<p>With the odd exception delegates to the round-table were agreed
on the merits of the all-embracing design philosophy often known as
'design for all' or 'universal design'. Among the benefits
mentioned were that it is relevant to both disabled and
non-disabled people and that businesses that have adopted it have
been rewarded with bigger market share and revenues.</p>
<p>However, delegates were also agreed that the design-for-all
philosophy has so far failed to make sufficient inroads into the
European commercial sector. Jan Steyaert (<a href=
"http://www.steyaert.org/jan">http://www.steyaert.org/jan</a>),
lecturer at the Fontys University of Professional Education in the
Netherlands, said survey results indicate that awareness,
resistance and sheer negligence are among the most common reasons
for the low level of adoption. Steyaert said: "We talked to a
company for instance that did the electronic versions of 21
regional newspapers in the Netherlands. They have the whole
population of the Netherlands as their customer base, and the guy
did not know about design for all: he did not know about the
concept or the need for it."</p>
<p>Another problem pointed out by Steyaert is 'untidy
implementation', like the inconsistent use of raised dots on the
keys of mobile phones or the use of black on green on mobile phone
screens. Steyaert's conclusions were drawn from research done for a
European Commission funded project called Dissemination Action
Supporting Design-for-All (<a href=
"http://www.dasda.org">http://www.dasda.org</a>).</p>
<p>Many felt legislation is the best way to make sure design for
all is adopted. Bas Treffers, a member of the European Disability
Forum in the Netherlands, said the EU should strengthen public
procurement rules to make access requirements binding, rather than
simply being optional criteria as they are now. In particular,
Treffers said, design-for-all compliance should be mandatory for
EU-funded projects.</p>
<p>Developments in North America were a rallying call to the
prolegislative lobby. Many cited the Americans with Disabilities
Act and Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act 1973 Federal
Acquisition Regulations (<a href=
"http://www.section508.gov">http://www.section508.gov</a>) as
examples of how changes to legislation and procurement policy can
promote design for all. Other regulatory levers advocated at the
conference including the incorporation of design for all in
standards for consumer products, a process now under way in
Europe.</p>
<p>The EDF is also calling for a new European non-discrimination
directive, making it illegal to discriminate against disabled
people. �We need a directive that includes sanctions for public or
private companies that do not comply with it, and that gives the
rights for NGOs and disabled individuals to bring to court
companies that do not comply with that.�</p>
<p>Kevin Carey, director of the digital accessibility charity
HumanITy, is skeptical about the possibility of creating
legislation to enforce design for all. According to Carey the
notion of design for all and the belief this approach could fulfill
more or less all the needs of disabled people are too extreme. "No
matter how good the designers are, as a blind person, nobody is
ever going to get the Mona Lisa right for me," Carey said.</p>
<p>What is more, Carey said, "Either of these two statements would
simply be minced by any decent lawyer." Because of this lack of
legal rigour, Carey said he was more interested in MEP Richard
Howitt's idea about changing declaration 22 of article 95 of the
Treaty of Europe into something more concrete (see news, this
issue).</p>

JIGSAW NEARS COMPLETION?</a></h1>
by Martin Sloan <a href=
"mailto:martin.sloan@orange.net">martin.sloan@orange.net</a>
<p>A combination of UK law, international guidelines and other
international legal or tribunal precedents may finally be combining
to help ensure the internet is made accessible for all.</p>
<p>Part three of the UK Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995
came into force in October 1999, imposing a series of duties on
service providers including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not to refuse to provide, or deliberately not provide a service
to a disabled person which he provides, or is prepared to provide
to members of the public [section 19(1)(a)]</li>
<li>Not to provide a lower standard or manner of service to a
disabled person [section 19(1)(c)]</li>
<li>To make �reasonable adjustments� in circumstances in which the
effect of that failure is to make it impossible or unreasonably
difficult for the disabled person to make use of any such service
[section 19(1)(b)]</li>
</ul>
<p>Although operators of web sites are not specifically included
within the definition of a �service provider�, a term left
deliberately vague, it is likely they are liable. Indeed, it seems
impossible to reasonably differentiate between the service provided
by a conventional retailer and one who is based online.</p>
<p>As �information services� are specifically included in section
19(3)(c), it is also arguable that all web sites are liable due to
the internet being just that � an extremely large and varied
information service. Whether rail timetables, Inland Revenue advice
or a promotional site for the latest ad campaign, these are all
sources of information.</p>
<p>The first duty imposed by the Act - "not to refuse to provide,
or deliberately not provide a service" - could arguably apply where
a service provider has deliberately chosen not to integrate
accessibility into his web site. This might include where a Flash
movie is used without an option to skip it, thus preventing people
using screen readers to progress any further. Although some might
argue this section is of limited application because knowledge is
required on the part of the service provider, there is a duty to
make reasonable inquiries under the code of practice that
accompanies the Act.</p>
<p>The second duty - that of "standard of service" - prohibits
service providers from providing a lower standard of service to a
disabled person, compared to that offered to an able-bodied person.
It is a straightforward argument that high street retailers
offering innaccessible online shopping services are in breach of
this rule.</p>
<p>The third, and perhaps most interesting of the relevant duties,
is that of "reasonable adjustments". The issue of whether
converting an inaccessible web site to an accessible web site was a
reasonable adjustment to make has already been considered under
similar legislation in Australia.</p>
<p>In the case of Maguire versus Sydney Organising Committee for
the Olympic Games, the Australian Human Rights Commission (<a href=
"http://www.hreoc.gov.au">http://www.hreoc.gov.au</a>) found in
favour of the complainant, Bruce Maguire, that the committee had
breached its duties as a service provider by providing an
inaccessible web site (see E-Access Bulletin, May 2001). The
commission rejected SOCOG�s claims that introducing accessibility
would be an unreasonable burden in terms of cost and manpower,
instead favouring the complainant�s expert witnesses, who said
compliance costs would be marginal. The commission also made
reference to the World Wide Web Consortium's accessibility
guidelines (<a href=
"http://www.w3c.org/wai">http://www.w3c.org/wai</a>), the first
time these have been mentioned in a court of law, as a recognised
set of guidelines that should be followed.</p>
<p>Although Australian cases are not regarded as authority in by
the courts in the UK, there is no doubt that they can be considered
persuasive in coming to decisions considering similar cases. This
is especially so where the foreign legislation is similar to that
in the UK (as is the case here with disability legislation) and
when dealing with issues raised by new technology. It is therefore
reasonable to expect that if and when an action is brought against
a service provider in the UK that the courts will follow the lead
set in SOCOG and expect service providers to comply with the W3C
guidelines by providing an accessible site.</p>
<p>Service providers would therefore be well advised to follow the
advice of the DDA code of practice, which obliges them to
continually review their duties and take into account
�technological developments [which] may provide new or better
solutions to the problems of inaccessible services� [paragraph
4.9]. This obligation is likely to be read as saying that: even if
a web site was designed before the introduction of the WAI
guidelines, they should still be adhered to as they are a new
�standard�.</p>
<p>The accessibility cause is likely to be given fresh impetus by a
new draft of the code of practice, to accompany the final part of
the DDA which comes into force in 2004. This is currently before
Parliament and is expected to contain more explicit references to
web accessibility when it is published in final form in February.
Not only will this act as a warning to service providers, but it is
also likely to lead to increased awareness of rights amongst the
disabled community. Combined, these factors should ensure
accessibility will finally be given the recognition it
deserves.</p>
