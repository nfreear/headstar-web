<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE -
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* DISABILITY ACT TIMETABLE
SLIPS.</a></h1>
<p>A delay in the publication of guidance relating to the education
provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act could cause
problems with the act's implementation, a leading charity has
warned.</p>
<p>The government was expected to publish codes of practice
explaining the obligations of schools and colleges under the DDA in
May but a delay in their presentation to Parliament has meant these
may now not appear until July or even later.</p>
<p>Once implemented, the act will make it unlawful for schools,
colleges and universities to reject applications from students
purely on the grounds of their disabilities.</p>
<p>According to Skill (<a href=
"http://www.skill.org.uk/about">http://www.skill.org.uk/about</a>),
an education and employment charity that helped draft the code of
practice, the delay may cause problems as schools, colleges and
universities must review and amend each curriculum and their staff
training, admissions and disciplinary procedures by September
2002.</p>
<p>Skill policy director Sophie Corlett said: �This legislation
should have a major impact. In the past, colleges could be quite
up-front about rejecting applications because of disabilities. It
also means that education providers have a duty to make reasonable
adjustments to provide support and access to disabled people.�</p>
<p>The whole of Great Britain will be subject to the September 2002
deadline, with Northern Ireland expected to follow shortly after.
By April 2003, the act further requires educational establishments
to offer �auxiliary services� such as sign language interpreters,
and by 2005 to complete physical adjustments such as installing
lifts.</p>
<p>To help fund the changes, the Department for Education and
Skills has made 70 million pounds available to schools in England,
the second chunk of a total budget of 220 million under the Schools
Access Initiative that will be spent on upgrading facilities for
the disabled by 2004.</p>
<p>However, Caroline Ellis, parliamentary officer at the RNIB, said
more sustained funding is necessary to make a substantial impact on
disabled access to education. "RNIB strongly welcomes the increases
but they will not touch on many of the key barriers faced by pupils
with sight loss. Specific and sustained funding is needed from the
government to ensure every school and local education authority can
provide accessible information to children and to ensure each
authority has enough mobility officers to train children to get
around independently. The situation at the moment is dire on both
counts, leaving parents, children and their teachers and support
staff at their wits' end.�</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* CWUAAT�S UP
DOC.</a></h1>
<p>A range of futuristic technologies for people with visual
impairment were unveiled last month at �CWUAAT�, the first
international Cambridge Workshop on Universal Access and Assistive
Technology.</p>
<p>Research into three-dimensional virtual reality training
environments for the visually impaired was presented by Dimitrios
Tzovaras of the Informatics and Telematics Institute in Greece. The
work, which forms part of an EU project entitled ENORASI, used a
�CyberGrasp� haptic glove to create the impression of solid objects
which could be felt, picked up, held and examined.</p>
<p>Trials undertaken by 26 blind volunteers included the
identification of three-dimensional virtual geometric objects on a
table-top which could be used in mathematics teaching; the physical
representation of moving graphs such as sinusoidal waves; virtual
maps with tactile features; a selection of virtual spheres of
different simulated materials that could be lifted and squeezed;
and some entertainment games including target shooting.</p>
<p>Another highly practical trial involved the simulation of a cane
that could be used to tap virtual objects to simulate situations
such as crossing the road at traffic lights. The users felt
sensations of holding a cane and also realistic vibrations and
sounds as virtual objects were tapped. For more information
see:<br />
<a href=
"http://www.iti.gr/db.php/en/projects/ENORASI.html">http://www.iti.gr/db.php/en/projects/ENORASI.html</a></p>
<p>Other technologies on display included a system to allow blind
or visually impaired people to create and read graphs and charts
such as bar graphs or pie charts developed by Professor Stephen
Brewster of the University of Glasgow. Using a �haptic mouse� which
creates a physical sensation when a user moves over a line on the
chart, Brewster said the system might for the first time allow
blind people to gain a proper overview of a diagram or chart (see
<a href="http://www.multivis.org">http://www.multivis.org</a>).</p>
<p>Joanne Coy of the privatised postal service Consignia, which
sponsored the workshop, told delegates that new Disability
Discrimination Act and an ageing population meant that large
employers had to take access technologies seriously if they are to
recruit from the best available talent and retain their existing
staff. arger Because of their scale and profile, organisations like
Consignia would be expected to lead in this field, she said.</p>

<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* EU TENDER LAW TO EMBRACE
ACCESSIBILITY.</a></h1>
<p>Accessibility issues could be allowed to overrule economic
factors in the allocation of public sector technology contracts
across Europe under new laws being considered by the European
Parliament.</p>
<p>On Monday the Parliament is to hold a public hearing to discuss
amendments to EU law that would apply to all public contracts
within its borders. Although it would not oblige organisations to
take accessibility issues into account, those that do could be
protected from challenges mounted under existing competition
laws.</p>
<p>Until now, EU laws on tendering have made promoting cross-border
trade their main priority, and have encouraged competition for
tenders by focusing on economic factors alone.</p>
<p>According to Labour MEP Richard Howitt, the move represents a
significant change in direction for European law. �It�s a very
important piece of legislation. It�s about Parliament revisiting
social and environmental clauses that were abandoned years ago in
favour of promoting competition, and recognising corporate and
social responsibility as legitimate goals in the public sector,� he
said. However, more progress is needed to bring Europe up to speed
with the US, Howitt said.</p>
<p>Public procurement transactions are thought to account for over
11 per cent of EU nations' combined economic output, but also have
a major impact on construction and public works, energy,
telecommunications and heavy industry.</p>

<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* EU COUNCIL CALLS FOR
ACCESSIBLE WEB.</a></h1>
<p>The Council of the European Union, the body representing EU
governments, last month issued a resolution that aims to encourage
its members to improve the accessibility of public sector
sites.</p>
<p>The resolution supports a communication issued late last year by
the European Commission that encourages European institutions and
governments to improve web accessibility (see E-Access Bulletin,
issue 22, October 2001).</p>
<p>The resolution "stresses" the need to increase efforts to
improve the accessibility of the web and "encourages" member states
and the commission to require their web sites to conform to the
World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility guidelines.</p>
<p>It is non-binding, but the council said it will be monitoring
progress and has asked member states and the commission to submit a
progress report in the first half of 2004.</p>

<p>NOTE: Last month the European Commission opened its first
documentation facility for visually impaired people, the VIP Office
at the Albert Borschette Conference Centre in Brussels. The centre
offers access for up to three people at a time to all commission
documentation currently available on the internet via technologies
such as text-to-speech and Braille keyboards. Other such centres
could follow in other EU institutions, and the commission hopes the
initiative will help to increase the number of visually impaired
staff working for it.</p>

advice on helping his 18-year old pupil Bruno to use a computer.
Bruno has cerebral palsy and cannot control the movement of his

CITY WALLS.</a></h1>
by Kevin Carey <a href=
"mailto:humanity@atlas.co.uk">humanity@atlas.co.uk</a>
<p>In the first half of 2000, during the Portuguese presidency of
the EU, the 'e-Europe' initiative was launched. At its core was the
idea that Europe needed to get its act together or it would be left
totally behind by digital developments in the US. But although it
already lagged behind in the use of desktop and laptop computers,
the EU was heartened at the time by Europe's lead in the mobile
phone and digital television fields.</p>
<p>At a ministerial conference in April 2000 there was a strand
dedicated to discussing the disability and access chapter of the
draft e-Europe Declaration. Of the 40 or so people present only
three were disabled: Judy Brewer, a wheelchair user from the US
representing the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI); Rodolfo
Cattani, an observer from the European Disability Forum (EDF) who
is totally blind; and myself, also totally blind and representing
the RNIB.</p>
<p>Most participants in the strand were well-meaning but out of
touch. They were too concerned with access to education and
employment which are already an integral part of other EU and
member states' initiatives, too interested in milestones and
benchmarks and the paraphernalia of international diplomacy, and
too little interested in access to shopping, banking, dating,
broadcasting, health and financial information.</p>
<p>On each of the two days the rapporteur - as the EU official
responsible for recording proceedings is known - read his notes
which I challenged for totally failing to reflect the substance of
the discussions and for possibly being written in advance of the
discussions. The notes were abstract, my calls were for concrete
measures. However I made a fatal tactical error by calling for the
currently trendy option of integrating disability into all aspects
of the declaration (a cross grained approach) rather than keeping
it as a separate chapter. In the next three months all the
significant proposals in the original chapter on disability were
traded away in their cross-grained manifestation. The only way you
can get anything if you are disadvantaged is to camp outside the
city but near its walls in order to cause trouble and get food
parcels; once inside you become invisible.</p>
<p>The e-Europe Declaration was duly approved by the EU Council of
Ministers in June 2000 and, as a result, a 'high level' committee
was set up to handle the Economic and Social Dimension of the
Information Society (ESDIS). For historical reasons this committee
was linked to member states' departments of employment or social
welfare under which disability usually falls. As far as I am aware,
nobody from a department of trade, industry, technology or
communications was nominated.</p>
<p>ESDIS subsequently established an 'expert group' in
e-accessibility. Each member state could nominate two experts, one
from government and one from the voluntary or academic sectors.
But, because the EU would only pay for one per country, member
governments concentrated on sending a government official, leaving
the the voluntary sector to contribute a member if it paid for
itself. This is a pity because, again, the officials almost all
come from welfare and employment backgrounds whereas the expert
group is necessarily supposed to contain technology experts.</p>
<p>I first heard about this group a year ago and it took me a while
to find out who represented the UK. I then discovered that he
wasn't all that keen on the assignment. So I proposed myself to the
Department for Work and Pensions (<a href=
"http://www.dwp.gov.uk">http://www.dwp.gov.uk</a>) as his
replacement; and at the beginning of this year it agreed. So I am
the first disabled voting member of the group, although the
redoubtable Mr Cattani of the EDF is an observer.</p>
<p>The group is currently reviewing legislation on disability and
e-Europe and is likely to come out soon with some recommendations
on procurement. I doubt they will be as rigorous as those under
'Section 508' in the US but we must do our best once the proposals
are published to tighten them up.</p>
<p>The group's second current work area is a review of technical
standards which has been farmed out to a some consultants who will
report back shortly. This is an interesting area of work but its
impact on real life will be severely limited unless there is some
political weight behind any emerging consensus. The problem is that
accessibility legislation in general terms is being formed against
a background of industrial deregulation. The outcome for access
rights is as inevitable as that for a bicycle in the path of a
juggernaut. Nonetheless, it may well be that formulating standards
will be the new way forward.</p>
<p>Which leads, naturally, to the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI
- <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>). This
has been a very successful instance of promoting a principle
through a set of standards. The EU has now accepted WAI's Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at the level of basic ('A')
compliance. There are four major issues to watch here:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, minimum compliance at level 'A' is rapidly becoming
maximum compliance; the basics are being seen as a ceiling and not
a floor.</li>
<li>Secondly, there are massive areas where the WAI guidelines need
improvement, particularly in the cognitive sector and with respect
to multimedia - we are a long way from establishing that all
multimedia should be 'multimodal', meaning that users can use a
variety of different inputs.</li>
<li>Thirdly, member states seem unable to resist a spot of
unilateral improvement. So, instead of participating in WAI to
formulate WCAG 2.0, each state is trying to make little
improvements. There is a danger of fragmentation which will, in
turn, lead to problems with assessment and compliance tools which
will be naturally designed to assess WAI compliance, not nationally
legislated compliance.</li>
<li>Fourthly, in spite of WAI already having a process to design
and approve assessment tools for compliance, some countries want to
develop their own, again leading to fragmentation. In this area,
however, the problems would be particularly severe because
impartiality, transparency and comparability are the backbone of
any system of compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final current strand of work for the expert group concerns
the establishment of an EU network of 'centres of excellence' to
formulate a design for all curriculum. This may sound rather dull
but it is potentially the most important development after the WAI
work because one of the big problems of accessible design is that
many designers don't have a clue what to do other than whip out all
the graphics.</p>
<p>So a lot of good work is going on, but we are still a long way
away from contemplating universal standards of service in banking,
broadcasting, dating, shopping, health and financial information.
Nevertheless, it is vital that we do eventually develop such
standards.</p>

early last century, and all have been completely accessible to me.
To say that Braille music has had no standardisation until the 1997
manual was released is inaccurate.</p>
<p>�Blind musicians have used Braille music for professional and
amateur reasons for 150 years. It has served us well all this time,
and certainly does not need to be replaced. If anybody suggested
changing the system of print music notation they would be told to
stop interfering where they were not wanted.</p>
<p>�The beauty of Braille music is that the performer can have
independent access to the score, making his or her own
interpretative decisions as any sighted performer would.</p>
<p>�Using this system, we can sight sing in a sighted choir! No
gadget would let us do that silently, or without headphones. Any
machine which gives audio descriptions of a piece could not be used
in an orchestral or choir rehearsal, since the "reader" is not
actually accessing the score, but a second-hand version of it.</p>
<p>�Braille music scores can be, and often are, laid out so that
information can be skimmed over, in headings, on lines of their
own. Bar numbers can be judicially printed on a separate line above
the bar to which they refer, so the fingers can easily locate them
and any other such headings using good tactile navigation
techniques. A purely pictorial method does not work, as we
discovered 150 years ago. But there is a lot of spatially presented
information in Braille music that can help the reader read in
greater or lesser detail as desired.</p>
<p>�Braille music is linear because that's how Braille works, but a
fluent reader can skim across a line and learn to recognise a
phrase mark, word sign, or a staccato mark extremely quickly. He or
she can then ignore that information if not required in that
particular reading. Of course a Braille reader can't get an
overview of a whole score as a sighted person can, and we all would
embrace technology which would assist in this. But for detailed
study the Braille music system works very well indeed.</p>
<p>�In my experience, it is also true that children take to it
extremely quickly. Even my seven-year-old student loves using it,
and doesn't find it confusing or unduly difficult.</p>
<p>�The lack of Braille music currently used or taught is due to a
lack of available scores quickly enough, and a lack of teachers
willing and able to teach it in a fun and relevant way. Funding
should be directed at greater production (using Braille music
translation software and manual transcription as appropriate), and
in the area of producing good UK based teaching material.</p>
<p>Of course signs need to be added to Braille music to cope with
21st century compositional techniques (graphical scores and so on),
as well as world musics, and I have no objection to research being
conducted in technology which can give extra information about a
score which Braille music does not, but let it be done in a spirit
of adding to what we already have, not replacing it because people
without proper knowledge think it's best for us.�</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bettye Krolick, Compiler of The New International
Manual of Braille Music Notation, writes: �John Henry, the
outstanding blind musician and scholar, asked me to share the
following information about what is going on in North America with
new developments regarding Braille music.</p>
<p>�Educators are realising that with a quick knowledge of how to
help blind students read music, they can open the advantages of
music participation to all youngsters by using the software that is
now available. Vocal, orchestral, and band parts as well as
keyboard music can be prepared by musicians who do not necessarily
know Braille. Goodfeel from Dancing Dots and Toccata from Optek
Systems are two translation programs that accurately produce
Braille scores containing exactly what is in the print scores.</p>
<p>�I recently returned from a conference of transcribers and
educators in the state of California where I showed a group of 26
sighted vision teachers how easy it is to read Braille music. As
soon as I reassured them that there are only seven different notes
in Braille music - the same seven notes that appear in each octave
of a piano - they relaxed, and within the 90 minute workshop all of
them were reading beginning music with great confidence. In order
to read more music signs, each teacher now has a small dictionary
of all the signs needed up through the first 12 grades of school
with very few exceptions, and their blind students will have the
same information in Braille.</p>
<p>�The complete Dictionary of Braille Music Signs that I wrote
contains information about the international work that began with
the Cologne Congress of 1888. It states details about the
remarkable number of Braille music signs (notes, note values,
octave signs, rests, accidentals, key and time signatures and so
on) that have never changed since 1888, thanks to a series of
international meetings and agreements.</p>
<p>�As far as tactile reading is concerned; it will die quickly -
as soon as someone gives the tester a few pages of cello music that
is commonly written with up to four different clef signs per
page.�</p>

by Judith Markowitz
<p>If you ask people in speech processing where the industry is
headed, many of them will say they envision a time in the near
future when speech will be a mainstream tool for communication and
information access anytime, anywhere and using any device. I would
add that this implies communication could be in any language.</p>
<p>Although opinions vary widely on how long it will take to
achieve these dramatic goals, in the past couple of years speech
technology has made significant progress. All major speech and
voice-processing technologies have made huge gains in speed,
accuracy, size and flexibility.</p>
<p>The most visible advances towards the anytime, anywhere, any
device goal have been made in automatic speech recognition (ASR).
ASR systems are now being successfully used in environments as
diverse as handheld devices, automobiles, public telephone networks
and warehouses. These implementations can range from a dozen words
to a million or more proper names. They can require
command-and-control, dictation and increasingly complex dialogue
structures.</p>
<p>Overall, the technology is far more accurate than it used to be,
although noise and deviations from standard speech patterns (for
example when someone has a cold, a speech impediment, or is
shouting) still cause performance degradation. Support of multiple
languages is increasing and a few systems incorporate language
identification technology so that the choice of language can be
done unobtrusively.</p>
<p>Distributed technology, which does some processing on the device
and some on the network, represents a significant advance towards
the anytime, anywhere, any device goal. Using distributed
processing, a person can use device-embedded ASR technology to
navigate a menu on a hand-held computer device or dial a telephone
number by voice. That person can also use the same device to access
network-based ASR, such as dictation tools, directory assistance
and other more complex, largervocabulary systems.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech synthesis technology (TTS) is another area that
has seen major developments recently. Some of the new breed of
�concatenated� TTS systems, which create words by linking together
or concatenating pre-recorded spoken sounds, are almost
indistinguishable from human voices. These systems have made it
possible to deliver news, alerts and frequently changing customised
information to people automatically - anytime, anywhere and to any
device. Today, these high-quality systems are too large to embed in
handheld devices, but the trend is to use compression and other
techniques to reduce the size of good TTS.</p>
<p>Voice-based biometrics, whose most widespread implementation is
speaker authentication to allow access to be blocked by
unauthorised users, supports anytime, anywhere, any device access
to data and services. Today, access is primarily via telephones,
but there is a strong trend to reduce voice models to sizes
suitable for embedded deployments.</p>
<p>As with ASR, noise remains an issue, particularly when a person
enrolls on one type of telephone but authenticates on another, for
example a mobile phone. Companies have begun to deploy model noise
conditions on different kinds of telephone channels. Another
important trend is the use of "background models" and other
techniques that model the voices of potential imposters.</p>
<p>Access control is also being enhanced through the verification
of knowledge. In some instances the person is asked to supply
specific pieces of information, (for example favorite colour,
father's middle name) and both the content and the voice speaking
it are authenticated. Other systems perform knowledge
authentication unobtrusively, as part of a general dialogue that
the system or an agent is having with the user.</p>
<p>Another key area of development to track in the field of speech
technology is one that is often overlooked, but an essential
component - that of microphones. Good audio input is an unobtrusive
asset to both ASR and voice-based biometrics. Poor audio input can
lead to higher error rates and the failure of an application.</p>
<p>Significant advances in microphone technology include far-field
technology and miniaturisation. Far-field technology can process
speech at distances of a foot or more, and makes wearing a headset
optional and supports spoken input to handheld devices and embedded
systems, for example in cars.</p>
<p>Tools that identify and extract noise from a signal are now
provided by microphone manufacturers, ASR technology developers and
by companies for which noise cancellation is important. The results
can be excellent, especially when the person is using a
close-talking microphone. It is also improving at a rapid pace for
far-field input. There is, for example, a great deal of work being
done in telematics on modeling noise associated with different
driving speeds. Unfortunately, with dynamic noise cancellation, too
many cooks spoil the broth. When a noise-canceling microphone is
used with noise-canceling ASR, the signal is actually degraded.</p>
<p>Unexpected variability in noise, for example from passing
vehicles, represent a persistent challenge. Variable noise and
extremely high noise levels are, however, also challenges for human
listeners. Addressing those problems is likely to require
intelligence about dialogue content and may need to exploit image
processing such as lip reading for disambiguation.</p>
