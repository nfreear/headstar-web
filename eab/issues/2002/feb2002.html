<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE -
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* RNIB TO AUDIT SITES FOR
FREE.</a></h1>
<p>The RNIB is to offer free web site audits to a series of
selected highprofile UK organisations over the next two years, in a
new phase of its �See it right� campaign funded by financial
services group Standard Life.</p>
<p>Standard Life is providing 50,000 pounds a year for two years,
plus a member of staff on secondment, to allow RNIB to offer the
free audits to around 50 organisations a year at an estimated cost
of between 600 and 1,450 pounds per audit. After two years the
process will be reviewed.</p>
<p>Anyone is free to apply, but the organisations to be audited
will be selected to represent a cross-section of sectors including
retail, charity, travel, education, utility and telecommunications,
and government. It is hoped the initiative will raise awareness of
web accessibility issues across society.</p>
<p>The �See it right� scheme has already audited several major
organisations including Tesco.com, Marks &amp; Spencer, PSI Group,
BT, the British Library, and the government�s web portal UK Online.
Standard Life is committed to making all of its own web sites
accessible by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The audits will use the world wide web consortium�s �WAI�
accessibility standards (<a href=
"http://www.w3c.org/wai">http://www.w3c.org/wai</a>), and the RNIB
estimates that the cost of making the average site accessible
following audit will be between one and two per cent of original
design costs.</p>
<p>Colin Low, the chairman of RNIB, said the inaccessibility of
most web sites currently means that for example �blind people were
not able to fill in census returns in privacy online, or book a
seat at the theatre without having to hang on the telephone for an
eternity�.</p>
<p>He said the internet could bring a vast amount of information
within reach of blind people for the first time, and with 8.7
million people with disabilities in the UK exercising spending
power of more than 40 billion pounds, it makes strong business
sense for companies to embrace inclusive design.</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* E-VOTING COULD BOOST
ACCESS.</a></h1>
<p>This year's UK local government elections, due to take place in
May, will see trials of internet voting, telephone voting and
electronic kiosk voting overseen by the Department for Transport,
Local Government and the Regions.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling arguments for electronic voting is
that it could offer people with disabilities, including the blind
and visually impaired, the chance to vote in complete privacy for
the first time.</p>
<p>Five local authorities - Nantwich, Liverpool, Sheffield, Swindon
and St Albans - will offer constituents the chance to vote using
ordinary computers or phones. Two of these - Sheffield and St
Albans - together with Chester, will also offer the option to vote
using a computer kiosk. It is not known if the kiosks will contain
speech software or if they will have tactile cues on the
keypads.</p>
<p>Not all of these trials have had details of their private sector
partners confirmed, but Liverpool and Sheffield city councils are
in talks with telecoms giant BT and online voting company
election.com; while Swindon is believed to be discussing its
options with the elections body Electoral Reform Services. Both BT
and the ERS said their systems would be accessible.</p>
<p>The DTLR has told E-Access Bulletin that all of the systems
shortlisted will be compliant with the Disability Discrimination
Act.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Irish government this week announced it too is to
try out electronic voting systems in May. Kiosk systems will be
used to cast and count votes in Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath
in the country's upcoming general election. However, the government
has ruled out the use of a voice-activated voting system in the
trial because of its cost. See: <a href=

<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* ACCESS COSTS NOT
"EXCESSIVE".</a></h1>
<p>EU member states need to be told web accessibility need not be
excessively expensive, the European Union's powerful Economic and
Social Committee said this week.</p>
<p>The comments came in response to a recent European Commission
communication encouraging European institutions and member states
to make their web presence accessible (see EAB, October and
November 2001).</p>
<p>The committee also said there is a need for developers and
disabled users to participate in joint training. It pledged to make
its own web site accessible by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The pronouncements follow research into accessibility issues by
Miguel Angel Cabra de Luna, director of Spanish charity for the
blind ONCE, on behalf of the ESC. A report will be posted shortly
onto the committee's web site (<a href=
"http://www.esc.eu.int">http://www.esc.eu.int</a>).</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* IRISH BILL GOES BACK TO
DRAWING BOARD.</a></h1>
<p>The Irish government has decided to postpone the reading of its
Disability Bill in the Dial, the Irish parliament, in the face of
"unanimous objections" from disability rights organisations during
the consultation period.</p>
<p>The bill, which was due to be introduced last week, was
lambasted by pressure groups which said it fails to confer
sufficient rights to people with disabilities, their parents,
siblings and carers.</p>
<p>The draft bill did say public sector bodies must ensure their
buildings and information are made available to everyone, "so far
as practicable". But critics pointed out that Section 47 of the
bill would deny the right to redress through civil courts.</p>
<p>According to Gerry Ellis, an accessibility consultant and former
chairperson of People with Disabilities in Ireland: "There is
nothing [in the bill] about any rights to access to information
technology. No powers for any ombudsman or other authority to
ensure access. No mention of public procurement policy including
accessibility as part of its criteria. Nothing about accessibility
being a condition for the granting of a thirdgeneration mobile
phone licence. In other words, there may be theory, but nothing to
make us feel that there will be actual progress."</p>

<h1><a name="section-17." id="section-17.">* SECTION THREE:
E-LEARNING</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>OPEN UNIVERSITY.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="section-18." id="section-18.">* OPEN DOOR
POLICY.</a></h1>
<p>The Open University (<a href=
"http://www.open.ac.uk">http://www.open.ac.uk</a>), the
distance-learning institution that is Britain�s largest higher
education body, is set to become the UK�s largest developer of
accessible learning technology as well.</p>
<p>The OU currently serves around 140,000 undergraduate students,
of whom more than 7,500 have some kind of disability. Around 900
are blind or visually impaired.</p>
<p>As a distance learning pioneer, technology plays a central role
in the university�s courses, with its own electronic conferencing
system allowing students on more than 150 courses to exchange more
than 150,000 messages a day.</p>
<p>Last year, the university announced in this bulletin that it was
to create a Centre for Assistive Technology and Enabling Research
(CATER) for disabled students, backed by one million UK pounds from
the Higher Education Funding Council for England, in the largest
project of its kind in the UK (see E-Access Bulletin, January
2001).</p>
<p>The centre is now up and running and headed by Ralph Keats, who
used the RNIB�s recent �Techshare� conference to explain the
university�s plans for improving access.</p>
<p>�Far too often in the past we have created courses and then
looked at accessibility afterwards as a bolt-on,� he said. �We had
to fight for every scrap of funding. But now it is at the heart of
everything we do � I can�t believe the changes that have taken
place over the past three years.�</p>
<p>The Open University has recently been granted the power to act
as its own awarding authority for disabled student allowances,
without having to go through central government, Keats said. Since
each student with disabilities may require as much as 4,500 pounds
worth of specialist technology for work leading to a degree, �we
acquired a lot of buying power overnight. Last year we spent three
million pounds on access technology.�</p>
<p>Increased influence came along with the spending power, he said,
�Suppliers want your business and so will work with you and we can
help to raise standards."</p>
<p>CATER is gearing up to work with everyone involved in putting
out OU courses, from graphic designers to those creating CD-ROM
packs, to help ensure their work is accessible. It is also going to
assess new learning technologies as they appear, for their
potential.</p>
<p>One of the main access technologies the university is currently
developing is �DREAM� (Digitally Recorded Educational Audio
Materials), a project which intends to replace analogue audio
recording of course materials with digital recording, to enhance
their quality, interactivity and accessibility.</p>
<p>Some 1,200 OU students currently access courses by audio
cassette, including the 900 visually impaired people plus a further
300 with dyslexia or manual impairments. Sound quality can be poor,
however, and degrades over time, and searching for material across
a course of several cassettes is all but impossible. Furthermore
when courses are revised every few years, an entirely new set of
analogue tapes needs to be created.</p>
<p>With digitised texts, there are a range of user interfaces from
which students can choose, as well as approved accessible web
interfaces to course information and work for blind students.</p>
<p>Another institution leading the way in accessible online
learning is the Royal National College for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.rncb.ac.uk">http://www.rncb.ac.uk</a>), an independent
national and international specialist further education
college.</p>
<p>�The college aims to help learners control and manage their own
learning, and this brings a heavy emphasis on control of computer
systems,� said Tim Ashmore, RNCB learning support manager.</p>
<p>�However, there is no consistent national approach at the moment
in training teachers in online learning. There are pockets of
activity, for example at the education technology agency Becta, but
where is the consistent strategy that we can tap into?�</p>
<p>The college has its own intranet for teachers and students, �RNC
Intralearn�, and students are gradually taught how to access
learning materials for themselves, Ashmore said. �Many learners do
not have the basic skills, so we are making it part of the core
curriculum. There are other problems, including funding, but this
is the only way to go, not least because we want our learners to
continue to use these technology skills beyond their college
courses.�</p>
<p>Shirley Evans, RNCB learning technology co-ordinator, said the
college had reviewed around 30 different �virtual learning
environment� products for their accessibility. �Accessibility as a
huge issue, but the core test seemed to be: did the environment
work with a screen reader?� she said.</p>
<p>The answer to many of the problems faced by the college and
other educational institutions as likely to be at least partly the
establishment of specialist teams of teachers nationally who could
help teachers locally with accessibility issues, Evans said.</p>
<p>Whatever the solutions, time is running out for both specialist
and mainstream education providers to get these issues right. Under
the new Special Educational Needs Disabilities Act (SENDA), from
September 2002 it will be unlawful for all education providers to
discriminate against disabled students by treating them less
favourably than others, and institutions will be required to make
adjustments including making electronic courseware accessible; and
allowing disabled people equal access to technical support for
their equipment (see <a href=
"http://www.techdis.ac.uk/articles/SENDRE.htm">http://www.techdis.ac.uk/articles/SENDRE.htm</a>).</p>
<p>The Open University�s Ralph Keats acknowledges that there will
always be problems making some types of course accessible, for
example music courses where special notations may be used, current
affairs courses where material needed to be up to the minute, and
any new course where materials were still being developed.</p>
<p>But he said the SENDA plus possible support from the Human
Rights Act meant visually impaired students would have more
legislative help than ever before in seeking accessibility. �We�ve
never had it so good.�</p>

conference at the Center on Disabilities, California State
University (CSUN � <a href=
"http://www.csun.edu/cod">http://www.csun.edu/cod</a>) is focusing
on the educational challenges of assistive technology. Topics to be
covered include training, online teaching, and the access
conundrums posed by non-Roman writing systems such as Braille,
mathematics and musical notation.</p>
<p>The following is a round-up of some of the main sessions
relating to blindness and visual impairment, with links to the
relevant session summaries.</p>
<p>Hans Russman of the Institute for Blind and Partially Sighted in

<p>Also debuting at CSUN are prototype web browser WebIE and
Organiser, an aptly named personal organiser. Paul Blenkhorn and
Gareth Evans, the creators of these two pieces of
Microsoft-enhancement software, conducted their research at the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in the
UK, with the financial assistance of the Guide Dogs for the Blind
Association: <a href=

<p>Deborah Gilden from the Kettlewell Eye Research Institute is
also hoping to help visually impaired people make the most of
Microsoft software. "Few realise that Microsoft Office applications
include many features that, although not intended for low-vision
viewers, can serve as even more powerful and flexible tools for
making screen images accessible," Gilden says:<br />

<p>John Gardner of Oregon State University will announce progress
in solving the knotty problem of providing access to mathematical
notation (see section three, January 2002). A beta version of a
mathematical text editing suite called WinTriangle has been in
testing since September last year:<br />

Nancilu McClellan will also address the problem of accessible
mathematics in a talk outlining how to use the speech recognition
capabilities of Dragon's NaturallySpeaking Professional and Dragon
Dictate:<br />

<p>William McCann and David Pinto of Dancing Dots will demonstrate
how JAWS screenreader scripts can be used by blind people to
record, edit and notate music using mainstream computers packages:

<p>On an international note, Hiroyuki Nakamura from the Japanese
Institute for Communication Environment will plead for
harmonisation in the accessibility standards-setting processes
being developed by different countries. He outlines how Japanese
access rules have become confusing and contradictory because they
have been set by two different bodies, the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications and the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry:<br />

<p>The key question in Umberto Eco�s novel �The name of the rose�
is whether the monks are keeping their books from people or for
them. The same question might be put to lawyers stubbornly sticking
to their Latin and doctors who are still wedded to Greek. This may
be fine enough in law where most people expect lawyers to represent
them but it is no longer acceptable in health care, where people
want much more control over what happens to them.</p>
<p>We ought to remember it is less than two years since a
paediatrician was attacked because vigilantes thought he was a
paedophile. Well, you may know the difference between a -trician
and a -phile but how many of us know our -ectomy from our -otomy?
Taking more control of our bodies requires a better understanding
of what clinicians are doing, or failing to do.</p>
<p>Dropping the Greek will no doubt help, but we will need to go a
good deal further than this in ensuring the digitisation of medical
records also increases their accessibility and usefulness. A record
that is either too vague or too indicative is bound to cause
enquiry and distress. So it is not only a matter of words but of
understanding the way that human beings handle information.</p>
<p>If you have a cancer, to be told that simply there are a variety
of measures that might be taken or, conversely, to be given a
single stark statistic relating to the probable cause or outcome of
the disease and nothing else, is bound to cause concern.</p>
<p>The problem is further complicated by the fact that the
information contained in a patient�s digital record will be
compared with a mass of health and medical information found by
patients on the web, some from NHS sites but much of it from the
sites of non-governmental organisations, support groups, or
campaigning organisations that my rely on talking up a problem to
raise funds for dealing with it, not to mention an explosion of
�alternative� therapy sites from the relatively mainstream to the
Druidic.</p>
<p>If we look at digital medical records there are really three
areas of interest for the patient: what is this condition; how does
it affect me; and what should I do? The first of these questions
hardly concerns traditional medical records because professionals
already know the background detail, and the third is not strictly a
matter for a record either, since it concerns the future. But in
the mind of the patient, all three have great weight.</p>
<p>Even if you are inclined to adopt a wholly mechanistic view of
physical wellbeing, that the brain has nothing to do with a stomach
condition, for example, there is still a serious problem in
translating anatomy and chemistry into humanity. With respect to
personalising the condition, there is not only the question of the
syndrome as it relates to an individual but there is also,
crucially, the question of statistical probability. And despite
being a society that depends to a massive degree on the
manipulation of information we are, by and large, statistically
illiterate.</p>
<p>Most of us cannot distinguish the causal from the contingent nor
the highly probable from the statistically possible. We live in an
age where the media have a vested interest in discrediting the sane
statistical truth, the most startling recent health-related
examples being the brief hysteria over necrotising fasciitis (the
�flesh-eating bug�) and continuing wild stories about cloning.</p>
<p>Finally there are further, more prosaic requirements for people
be able to get hold of the information they need. Will the print
size and font be adjustable, for example, or will people be able to
choose between image maps and text explanations? However these
questions, though vitally important, are trivial next to the ones
posed above about the fundamental accessibility and usefulness of
the information in the record. Before we get too obsessed, yet
again, with the technology, we need to look at the psychology.</p>
