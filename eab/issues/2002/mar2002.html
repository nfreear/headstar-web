<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE -
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* TALKING LINK SETS A DATE
FOR TRIPLE DELIVERY.</a></h1>
<p>A new RNIB-backed 'Talking Link' project has set a September
launch date for all three of its major components: a searchable
index to accessible web sites; an accessible internet service
provider; and a new method for sending and receiving sound over the
internet.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly Chris Knowles, managing director of the
Chorley-based company Five Links which is behind the project, says
his team is working flat out to hit the deadline.</p>
<p>Once complete the Talking Link site (<a href=
"http://www.talkinglink.com">http://www.talkinglink.com</a> ) will
contain a searchable directory of web sites that satisfy the main
international accessibility standards. Knowles says he is very
hopeful the site will itself gain an RNIB's 'See it right'
accessibility award.</p>
<p>The site will offer novices the option to download basic
screenreading and magnification packages for free. Knowles says
these are simple enough to learn in minutes.</p>
<p>Five Links has also developed a compression algorithm to allow
audio files to be played in real time over normal dial up modems,
and is using this at the core of a new audio-media distribution
system.</p>
<p>In its third project, Talking Link will run an accessible
internet service provider, and is attempting to reach a further
deal with cable company Telewest to deliver accessible content
through set-top boxes.</p>
<p>The RNIB has already provided financial and practical backing
for the project.</p>
<p>The company has received further assistance from the Department
of Work and Pensions, Department of Trade and Industry and the
Office of the e-Envoy, and is hopeful of receiving funds from the
Small Firms Merit Award for Research and Technology scheme
(<a href="http://www.smartwise.org.uk">http://www.smartwise.org.uk</a>
).</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* NEWS FLASH.</a></h1>
<p>Web designers using Macromedia�s 'Flash' web graphic animation
technology can now add text tags, allowing visually impaired users
to access animations with screen readers for the first time.</p>
<p>The silicon valley company has launched Flash MX (<a href=
"http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash">http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash</a>
), a new version of the software which developers can use to add
descriptive text to animations and user interfaces. And the latest
version of the web browser 'plug-in' software that allows people to
view the animations, Flash Player 6, now also supports the screen
readers used by visually impaired people.</p>
<p>�This will make more sites accessible to disabled people because
up till now there�s been this thing with parallel sites. It�s been
either Flash or HTML,� said Matthew Carey, a designer at design
agency Text Matters (<a href=
"http://www.textmatters.com">http://www.textmatters.com</a> ).
Underlying the new tagging capability are tools that allow
developers to split animations into separate sequences. The
animation flows seamlessly when played, but also for the first time
allows the user to navigate with the browser �back� button, an
essential feature for accessibility.</p>
<p>GW Micro has become the first screen-reader software
manufacturer to respond to these developments, launching an
upgraded version of its 'Window Eyes' product that is compatible
with the new Flash tools.</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* DOLPHIN ADDRESSES ACCESS
PROBLEMS.</a></h1>
<p>Dolphin Computer Access, which runs an internet service provider
aimed at visually impaired people called dolphinaccess.net, this
week issued a statement to explain recent shortcomings in service
brought to the attention of E-Access Bulletin by frustrated
readers.</p>
<p>The ISP's parent company Dolphin Computer Access said its
connection and support service supplier Affinity Internet Holdings
had been contacted and was now dealing with the matter. Affinity
were said to be making additional ports available at the end of
March and to be hiring extra help-desk staff.</p>
<p>"This means that we should see improvements in the next couple
of weeks," Dolphin's statement concluded. When contacted by
E-Access Bulletin, Affinity said the connection problems had been
caused by a "software glitch in the network" which it had cured
this week.</p>
<p>Dolphin did not rule out compensating its internet customers for
the problems they have experienced with the service for more than
six weeks. Many are signed up to an 'anytime' package costing 14.99
pounds a month, but are only able to establish a connection during
office hours, equivalent to a 'worktime' service that costs 9.99
pounds. Dolphinaccess.net product manager Mark Hill encouraged
disgruntled customers to email him on <a href=
"mailto:mark.hill@dolphinuk.co.uk">mark.hill@dolphinuk.co.uk</a></p>
<p>One angry subscriber to the service who has had difficulty
connecting since January said: "From their perspective as a
company, it is what they need to say, but it doesn't address the
fact that I've only had food in because I've been able to shop from
work."</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* GOVERNMENT BACKS
COPYRIGHT EXEMPTION.</a></h1>
<p>The UK government has said it will support a private member's
bill to legalise the limited production of accessible digital
versions of copyright material on a non-profit basis, in its second
reading today. Private bills are brought to Parliament by backbench
MPs, in this case the Labour MP Rachel Squire.</p>
<p>If it is voted through, the Copyright (Visually Impaired
Persons) Bill will enter the committee stage where amendments to
its wording can be made.</p>
<p>Though the government backing will mean it has a better chance
of making it into the statute books it is no guarantee of success,
warns RNIB campaigns officer David Mann. "It is still a private
member's bill and will get pushed out if other business comes
along."</p>
<p>But if all goes well, sections of the proposed legislation that
would allow the distribution of single digital copies between
qualifying individuals could come into force as soon as July, Mann
says. This would have enormous immediate benefit, particularly for
students, he says.</p>
<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* LAW TIGHTENS ON WEB
ACCESSIBILITY.</a></h1>
<p>A new draft code of practice for the UK's Disability
Discrimination Act suggests that organisations may be legally
obliged to provide websites that are accessible to disabled
people.</p>
<p>The act itself makes no specific mention of web sites but the
new code, which offers guidance on sections of the act due to come
into force in October 2004, refers to e-commerce sites. It says:
"An airline company provides a flight reservation and booking
service to the public on its website. This is a provision of a
service and is subject to the act."</p>
<p>According to observers, although the draft is not an infallible
interpretation of the act but the courts would almost certainly
consider it a guide. It could therefore help resolve the question
of whether or not websites would be subject to the same law that
obliges service providers to ensure that "a physical feature is not
making their service impossible or unreasonably difficult for
disabled people to use".</p>

<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">* ACCESS STANDARDS REACH
METADATA CORE.</a></h1>
<p>The 'Dublin Core' Metadata Initiative, an international forum
committed to developing metadata standards, has created an interest
group to work on accessibility issues.</p>
<p>The group (<a href=
"http://dublincore.org/groups/access">http://dublincore.org/groups/access</a>
) is intended to be an open forum, drawing together participants
from all countries and sectors, especially "those with experience
in the development and use of metadata relating to accessibility".
The group has set up a mailing list where discussions will take
place at. To join see: <a href=

<p>Dublin Core, named after the Dublin, Ohio venue of the
initiative's first workshop in 1995, recently submitted a proposal
to the European Commission for a network of groups to work on
implementing metadata standards across Europe. Since 1995 a further
eight workshops have been held in England, Australia, Finland,
Germany, Canada and the US. There are currently 53 organisational
members of the initiative.</p>

<h1><a name="section-16." id="section-16.">* FURTHER MATHS:
Following our January piece on access to</a></h1>
mathematical computing, John Gardner, director of the Science
Access Project at the Department of Physics, Oregon State
University, writes in to provide some additional insights in this
field.
<p>Of his department's research, he says: "We're not quite finished
yet, but we do have methods by which blind and sighted people can
now share math and science information in electronic forms that
both can read and write. Ideally both sighted and blind people will
soon be using web formats such as HTML/MathML.</p>
<p>"Until recently these weren't very useful even to sighted people
but that's about to change dramatically. We're facing the challenge
of catching up again by making MathML readable and writable by
blind people, but I'm fairly confident that we'll have that ability
within a few years. Then all barriers will be gone."</p>
<p>Gardner and four of his students are due to present a paper to
the CSUN access conference in California next week (<a href=
"http://www.csun.edu/cod">http://www.csun.edu/cod</a>) that will
demonstrate how the students "are able to do things that nobody
even dreamed of before". The paper is online at:<br />

<h1><a name="section-17." id="section-17.">* EDUCATIONAL ENDEAVOUR:
Juan Carlos Benito, a special</a></h1>
education teacher in Santander, Spain, says: "I think this is the
appropriate forum to share concerns and seek solutions for one of
my pupils who has cerebral palsy. Bruno is 18 years old and he is
now in the fourth grade of secondary school. He was born with
cerebral palsy and he therefore has to use constantly a wheelchair.
He cannot speak and he cannot control the movement of his limbs �
only his eyes.
<p>"With all these limitations, he has reached the described
learning level thanks to his high intelligence and to an education
plan to integrate people with disabilities in ordinary centres. The
young man needs every kind of help but, especially in the academic
and relational fields, he would acquire a new world of
self-sufficiency if he could have a technology that would enable
him through the movement of eyes, the cerebral waves or another
means not requiring to be manipulated, to use a computer.</p>
<p>"Unlike blind pupils this young man has useful eyes but he does
not know how to take advantage of them. We would be extremely
grateful if we could obtain information on experiences,
technologies or organisations that could offer Bruno
solutions."</p>
<h1><a name="section-18." id="section-18.">* MAPPING DILEMMA:
Finally, Kate Page of the government-</a></h1>
funded conservation body English Nature says the organisation "is
all for accessible web sites but we seem to have become a bit stuck
on web mapping - the software used to produce this does not allow
for 'alt' tags. Does anyone have a solution?"

<h1><a name="section-20." id="section-20.">* CATCHING UP WITH ONE'S
NOTES.</a></h1>
by Derek Parkinson <a href=
"mailto:derek@headstar.com">derek@headstar.com</a>
<p>Visually impaired people are often musically gifted: Louis
Braille himself was a talented player of the cello and keyboard
instruments. But curiously, at present, there is no system of music
notation widely accepted as a standard that meets the needs of
blind people.</p>
<p>While versions of Braille music have been developed, it took
until 1997 to produce an internationally agreed standard and its
adoption has been slow.</p>
<p>There are two likely reasons for this: low levels of general
Braille literacy and the intrinsic limitations of Braille music
itself. �Only a fairly small proportion of blind people use
Braille. The RNIB has produced statistics showing that only
something like two per cent of young people can read it,� says
Alistair Edwards, a computer science lecturer at York University
who has researched alternative notations. �Braille music is quite
cumbersome: it�s a linear notation whereas conventional notation
uses the two dimensions of the page,� he says.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that Braille notation forces the reader
to absorb all the information in a score or none at all. There is
no flexibility allowing a reader to switch between scanning for
general features and concentrating on particular details. �There
are problems with grouping notes, for example,� says Edwards. �In
printed form this is done with phrase marks � which are easy to
pick out � but in Braille, you get something like �phrase begins
here�, and �phrase ends here� further along, and without any
warning.�</p>
<p>For all the difficulties, notation is essential if visually
impaired people are to study music beyond school, or find a career
composing scores for film and television, for example. �If you want
to go to the Royal College of Music or study as an undergraduate,
the level of detail you need can only be provided by Braille music
or some kind of notation,� says Jacqueline Clifton, founder of
Musicians In Focus (<a href=
"http://www.musiciansinfocus.org">http://www.musiciansinfocus.org</a>
), an organisation that provides training and support for visually
impaired musicians.</p>
<p>�We are concerned to promote the use of Braille music, but there
is a problem of availability: because it�s difficult to get hold
of, there�s a reluctance to learn it, particularly among young
people,� she says.</p>
<p>Despite this difficulty, Musicians In Focus has around 10
students between the ages of 8 and 16 attending Saturday classes at
the Royal College of Music. �If you start them young it�s much
easier,� Clifton says. One of her 10 year-old students has become
fluent in Braille music after studying for one year, while a
further 10 are studying at colleges of higher education and two
students are enrolled on undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>Musicians In Focus aims to achieve recognition as a National
Training Organisation for arts, but in the meantime Clifton is
concentrating on launching an apprenticeship scheme in September
next year. The plan is to allow suitable students to become
trainers themselves, offering tuition in Braille music and helping
new entrants master the technology.</p>
<p>Blind musicians are highly dependent on technology for creating
scores, whether fluent in Braille music or not. At present, this is
achieved by recording a piece in a digital file format such as MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and editing it on a PC using
sequencing software and a screen reader.</p>
<p>�This can produce very accurate scores, but has the drawback
that it reproduces everything from the MIDI file, so any
inaccuracies or traits are carried through and have to be edited,�
says Clifton. Another drawback to this approach is that it squeezes
all the information from a piece of music into very long lists of
symbols � exactly the same kind of problem that afflicts Braille
music.</p>
<p>At York University, Edwards is keen to rethink the approach to
notation. He recently supervised 'Weasel'<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.benchallis.com/research.htm#Weasel">http://www.benchallis.com/research.htm#Weasel</a>),
a research project to develop an interface made up of a tactile
surface overlaid on a touchsensitive pad. Using the pad blind
musicians are able to scan a piece for general structure and then
pick out aspects such as pitch or rhythm either singly or in
combination, or look at specific markings like fingering or
performance instructions.</p>
<p>Instead of Braille music output, Weasel can produce either music
or an audio description of the passage selected. At present the
Weasel interface is used for reading music rather than writing it,
although Edwards is confident that it will be adaptable for
writing.</p>
<p>But while the technology might not be a problem, funding further
projects may well be. Edwards is keen to build a kit version of
Weasel for music teachers but has found that projects of this sort
often fall outside the remit of funding bodies. �There�s no state
funding so we have to approach it like any other research project.
The original Weasel project was funded by the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council, but we tend to fall between two
stools. We�re seen as working on something that�s more education
than engineering or vice-versa.�</p>
<p>But if, with enough badgering, the team does manage to ferret
out the funds, the weasel will live again.</p>

SPOILS?</a></h1>
by Saqib Shaikh <a href=
"mailto:ss@saqibshaikh.com">ss@saqibshaikh.com</a>
<p>With an exemption to allow blind people to send and receive
copyrighted digital material looking likely to become UK law (see
news this issue), the age of the accessible e-book could be just
around the corner. But will the software and hardware available to
read the books be serviceable enough to inspire this renaissance in
reading?</p>
<p>The DAISY (<a href=
"http://www.daisy.org">http://www.daisy.org</a> ) consortium is
likely to be the main format the new breed of books will be
distributed in, but we can expect a multitude of specialised
reading devices.</p>
<p>Those who already own computers may opt for software players
because no extra equipment will be required. But those who cannot
use computers, or computer users who wish to listen to talking
books on the move, may opt for a hardware player.</p>
<p>Each player will offer different ways of navigating such as
skipping to particular sections or pages, searching for keywords
and ignoring certain elements such as pictures, footnotes or
side-bars.</p>
<p>E-Access Bulletin has tested three prototype DAISY e-book
readers: two pieces of software and one hardware reader. They were
LPPlayer software from Dolphin Computer Access subsidiary
Labyrinten Data AB (<a href=
"http://www.labyrinten.se">http://www.labyrinten.se</a> ); Victor
Reader Soft software from Visuaide (<a href=
"http://www.visuaide.com">http://www.visuaide.com</a> ) of Canada;
and Victor Reader Pro, Visuaide's latest portable machine for
reading e-books on CD.</p>
<p>LPPlayer has some built-in speech feedback, using an English
voice with a noticeable Scandanavian accent, as one might expect
from a Swedish company. While all dialogues are spoken, other parts
of the program, such as the menus, are not and you will need a
screen reader to access these. However, the non-talking parts are
not crucial to the program's operation.</p>
<p>As well as playing the book, LPPlayer has the ability to show
the text and images as it is being read. The user can change the
font and size of text.</p>
<p>LPPlayer offers a variety of methods of navigating a book. You
can either move through section by section; move one page or
paragraph at a time; or move through the book page by page, or jump
to a particular page. It is also possible to search the book for a
particular word or phrase. There is no method for manually fast
forwarding or rewinding the book however - you will need to
navigate by paragraph instead.</p>
<p>The program also allows you to set up to nine bookmarks, which
you can jump back to at a later time. Also, you can make audio
notes (up to 60 seconds) or text notes (up to 80 characters) to
record thoughts on particular passages.</p>
<p>Victor Reader Soft (VRS) contains all of the features of
LPPlayer except the ability to record audio notes, and many extra
features as well.</p>
<p>One of the major differences between VRS and LPPlayer is that
the former is almost completely self-voicing, using a male Canadian
voice. For those users who prefer to use their existing screen
reader, VRS provides scripts for some readers, including JAWS.</p>
<p>VRS also provides a much more comprehensive set of navigation
features. It is easy to move by various amounts, skip in and out of
sections, and even get an overall outline of the document. VRS also
has full fast-forward and rewind features, as well as the ability
to skip forwards and backwards a specified amount of time. A
history feature keeps a record of the past five places in which you
were listening to this book, and you can skip back and forth
through the history.</p>
<p>VRS also provides many more features than LPPlayer for
annotating a book, including more bookmark facilities. It also
provides more information about the book, and allows the user to
build up a 'bookshelf' on their hard disk. There are many other
extra features, such as greater control over the reading voice and
the display. Users may even create their own user profiles to store
their own personal preferences.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the nicest features about VRS is its
comprehensive help system. The software includes a 'key describer'
mode which is useful to learn all the controls. There is also a
getting started guide, a reference guide and a quick reference
guide. All three are provided in DAISY format, allowing you to
practice using the software as you read them.</p>
<p>Finally, Victor Reader Pro, Visuaide's hardware DAISY e-book
reader, is similar to its software stablemate, but also has some
extra features. The unit itself is approximately 20 centimetres by
15 centimetres, and weighs around a kilogram. It can either be used
with a mains power supply or a built-in rechargeable battery.</p>
<p>The controls for Victor Pro are on the top of the unit. In the
centre there is a numeric keypad. The majority of the reading
features are executed from this keypad. Below the keypad there are
play/stop and fastforward /rewind keys. Running vertically down the
right-hand-side, there are a number of buttons for changing the way
in which the unit reads, while down the left there are more
navigation and bookmark-related keys. Like Victor Reader Soft it
also has a key describer feature. This is even more useful on this
hardware unit for learning what the various buttons do.</p>
<p>The feature set is very similar to that of VRS. The unit uses a
British female voice to speak all prompts and messages. In addition
to volume and speed controls, Victor Pro also has a tone control.
The other main extra feature is the ability to play audio CDs. In
fact, since you can use many of Victor's e-book reading features
with audio CDs, it makes for a rather powerful CD player!</p>
<p>On the other hand, Victor Pro does not have a display, and you
cannot make text notes with it since there is no keyboard, but you
can still set bookmarks and make other annotations. Other features
absent in the hardware device include support for multiple users
and screen readers.</p>
<p>My personal preference is for the Victor software and hardware.
While LPPlayer certainly had a wide set of features, I found
Victor's interface more intuitive, I liked the fact it was fully
self-voicing, and the help feature is excellent � one can never
have too much help with technology!</p>

<h1><a name="section-24." id="section-24.">* TOUGH BALANCING ACT
FOR 'UBER-REGULATOR'.</a></h1>
by Derek Parkinson <a href=

<p>This week, legislation was enacted that lays the foundations for
Ofcom, a new regulatory body for the entire communications sector
that will have an enormous impact on the lives of disabled people.
Ofcom will be tasked with ensuring that new communications
technologies are accessible to all. But recent experience in the US
has shown that even a forward-thinking regulator may not be enough
to get disabled people the services they deserve.</p>
<p>In the UK, a new Communications Act has received its final
reading in the Commons and is in line for Royal Assent. The first
part of the act lays down the responsibilities of the new
�uber-regulator� Ofcom, which draws together the duties previously
discharged by the telecoms regulator Oftel, the Radiocommunications
Agency, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Independent
Television Commission, the Advertising Standards Commission, the
Advertising Standards Authority and the BBC Board of Governors. The
second part of the act, which formalises Ofcom�s aims, scope and
powers, is not expected to become law before the second half of
2003.</p>
<p>The new regulator aims to reflect the growing convergence
between communications technologies and will operate within an
extremely broad rubric, combining the licensing and consumer
protection role of its predecessor bodies with enhanced powers to
enforce competition legislation.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of communications service providers have
been sketched out in a separate government white paper (<a href=
"http://www.communicationswhitepaper.gov.uk">http://www.communicationswhitepaper.gov.uk</a>
) but these have not given campaigners for disabled access much to
cheer about. The government commits itself �to ensure everybody has
easy access to communications services, either free at the point of
delivery - in the case of public service broadcasting - or at an
affordable price - in the case of other communications services�;
but this commitment will have to be balanced against its role to
encourage competition, which led to controversial results in the
case of the old telecoms watchdog Oftel.</p>
<p>Oftel was proud of its so-called �regulation with a light
touch�, which loosely translated as intervening only when market
forces were seen to fail. Oftel�s critics often accused the
regulator of a �do nothing� approach, or of doing too little, too
late.</p>
<p>It is too soon to tell how well Ofcom will balance its various
responsibilities. But there are already signs that forcing
broadcasters to make content available to the visually impaired by
including audio descriptions, for example, is only half the
battle.</p>
<p>Peter Wilkins of the National Federation of the Blind of the UK
(<a href=
"http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nfbuk">http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nfbuk</a>)
expresses concern that even if broadcasters provide audio
descriptions of content, many blind users in the UK will be unable
to use them: �By our estimates, only 45 people in the whole of
South East England have the necessary technology. Audio
descriptions are now available for digital terrestrial services,
but you need a set-top box to access them. The question is � who
pays for or subsidises them? The RNIB can�t really afford to, which
leaves the manufacturers or the government."</p>
<p>In fact, there are other funding candidates: service providers
such as Sky have received state subsidies to promote low-cost
set-top boxes as part of the government drive to stimulate the
take-up of digital TV. Wilkins is unimpressed by their efforts,
however: �Their electronic guides have menus that list programmes
with audio descriptions, but a blind person can�t access the
guide!� he says.</p>
<p>Wilkins� concerns were echoed by the RNIB: �We estimate it will
cost about 3 million pounds to produce 20,000 audio modules.
[Government minister] Kim Howell has said that the Department of
Culture, Media and Sport is determined to increase the take-up of
these things, but how? � the DCMS doesn�t have a spare 3 million
pounds, so it will have to be extracted from the Treasury,� says a
spokesman.</p>
<p>If the US is any indicator of what the UK can expect to
experience further down the line, Ofcom may have its work cut out
ensuring that broadcasters stick to their obligations in providing
even a statutory minimum level of access. Last month the American
Council of the Blind (ACB) reacted angrily after a group of US
television, video and cable companies tried to stall Federal
Communications Commission regulations that would make audio
captions compulsory for a small proportion of TV content in the
US.</p>
<p>ACB president Christopher Gray called on the National
Association of Broadcasters, the National Cable Telecommunications
Association and the National Motion Picture Association of America
to "stop this senseless attack on the needs and rights of blind
people". Gray�s reaction followed a move by the broadcasters to
block regulations that require top commercial networks to provide
50 hours per quarter of prime time and/or children�s programming
with video description.</p>
<p>The US regulations, which also set requirements on emergency
broadcast information, have been available for consultation since
the end of 2000. However, one month before they were due to come
into effect the broadcasters jointly filed a petition to the
District of Columbia Appeal Court, claiming the regulations are
inconsistent with the Communications Act of 1934, impose a scheme
of �compelled speech� on the petitioner's members, and are
inconsistent with the first amendment of the US Constitution.
Surprisingly, they were joined by the National Federation of the
Blind, which claimed in a separate filing that the rule is
arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this debate is about more than access to
entertainment. In April 2000, FCC chairman William Kennard
supported the amendments to the 1996 Communications Act by citing
the case of Sharon McLawhorn, a deaf woman who missed a flood
warning broadcast on local networks because it was not captioned
properly, and was stranded for 24 hours before rescue arrived.</p>
