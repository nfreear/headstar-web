<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE:
NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">*1: ACCESSIBLE CINEMA PLAN
REJECTED</a></h1>
<p>The UK's Film Council has rejected a proposal to spend six
million pounds on equipping cinemas with technology that would make
films accessible to visually impaired people.</p>
<p>The plan, put forward by the Cinema Exhibitors Association,
would have installed audio description and subtitling equipment in
cinemas nationwide. It was one of three bids competing for a pot of
money from the national lottery earmarked for the council's
'specialised exhibition and distribution strategy' (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/film">http://fastlink.headstar.com/film</a>).
The strategy aims to "develop film culture in the UK by improving
access to, and education about, the moving image" and specifies
that "the needs of people with disabilities must inform and be
integral to any proposed developments".</p>
<p>However, according to the council, "the vast majority of those
responding to a consultation with film distributors and cinemas
felt this wasn't the best way of serving disabled people. In
particular question marks were raised both over the technology
proposed and the lack of expertise available to operate it in
individual venues." The cash will be used instead to subsidise
screenings of foreign and 'art house' films in regional
cinemas.</p>
<p>Last month, the Film Council appointed consultants Access
Matters (<a href=
"http://www.accessmattersltd.co.uk">http://www.accessmattersltd.co.uk</a>)
to help develop its strategy on disability issues.</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">*2: DIGITAL TV MADE
EASY.</a></h1>
<p>An initiative to make designers of digital television products
more aware of the difficulties experienced by all kinds of user,
including visually impaired people, has been launched by 'Easy TV',
a partnership between the Independent Television Commission (ITC),
the Consumers' Association and the Design Council.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/easy">http://fastlink.headstar.com/easy</a>),
the ITC and Consumers' Association are co-sponsoring an interactive
digital television product design award that will be promoted in
design colleges across the UK. Research for Easy TV recently
discovered that marginalised groups such as disabled or aged people
would be more likely to use digital television if there were fewer
buttons on remote controls, quicker responses to button presses and
simpler user manuals.</p>
<p>The new move fits in with the non-prescriptive, 'best practice'
approach towards accessibility for consumer technology products set
out by the government in its new Communications Bill, which is due
to be introduced into Parliament by the end of the year. While it
sets accessibility targets for digital television content, it
leaves product issues such as the design of television sets up to
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Disability groups feel this approach does not go far enough. A
spokesperson for the RNIB said: "Easy TV helps get the message
across to manufacturers and designers, but best practice is not
enough, we would like to see standardisation."</p>
<p>Readers of E-Access Bulletin who have experienced the technology
are invited to send us suggestions for design improvements to
television sets, remote controls and set-top boxes. All replies
should be sent to <a href=

<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">*3: AUDIO DESCRIPTION
COALITION TO FIGHT ON.</a></h1>
<p>US access campaigners have pledged to continue their campaign to
make audio description of a minimum amount of television and video
programming mandatory, after an appeals court scrapped existing
quotas.</p>
<p>Since April this year the Federal Communications Commission has
required television networks to broadcast at least 50 hours of
audio described programming every three months. The National
Association of Broadcasters, the National Cable Telecommunications
Association and the National Motion Picture Association of America
mounted a challenge against the regulations in March, claiming they
imposed 'compelled speech' and were inconsistent with the first
amendment of the US Constitution (see E-Access Bulletin, March
2002). On 8 November the court ruled in their favour, meaning the
continuation of audio description at these levels is now
voluntary.</p>
<p>"It will be really interesting to see whether they continue to
do what they have been doing really well since April," said
Margaret Pfanstiehl, chair of the National Television and Video
Access Coalition, a group of 17 organisations attempting to defend
the quotas.</p>
<p>The coalition will now try to reinstate the rule by persuading
Congress of its importance, said Pfansteihl, though this could take
as long as ten years following the recent Republican majority at
the US mid-term elections. "Republican control means short term
success is unlikely. They are in a strong mood to deregulate
everything," she said.</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">*4: TEXT MESSAGES FIND A
VOICE.</a></h1>
<p>New technology allowing visually impaired people to listen to
mobile phone text messages through conversion to natural-sounding
speech is being developed by BT, the telecommunications company
announced this month.</p>
<p>The technology, which could become commercially available within
a year, can be installed on a mobile phone directly or on a
palm-top computer that has an infra-red link to a phone. Users can
maintain privacy by listening to their messages through earphones,
and the speech output can be programmed to recognise popular text
messaging shortcuts which could otherwise sound like gibberish.</p>
<p>According to Adam Oliver of BTexact (<a href=
"http://www.btexact.com">http://www.btexact.com</a>), BT's advanced
technology research arm, the project was initiated after visually
impaired teenagers visited BT as part of a school project. "One of
the visitors, Mesad, made an innocent remark about how difficult it
was for him to access text messages, and it all started from
there," said Oliver. BT has since tested the new technology with
the help of Able2, its own internal network of disabled employees
(<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/able2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/able2</a>).</p>
<p>BT is not the only mobile service provider to be working on the
speech conversion of text messages, however. About a year ago its
rival Vodafone announced it was working on a similar system, though
it could not offer a firm delivery date (see E-Access Bulletin,
December 2001).</p>
<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">*5: AUDITORS TO SCRUTINISE
E-GOVERNMENT</a></h1>
<strong>ACCESSIBILITY.</strong>
<p>The National Audit Office (<a href=
"http://www.nao.gov.uk">http://www.nao.gov.uk</a>), the official
auditor of UK government agencies, is to publish a report on the
accessibility of government web and other electronic services early
in the New Year, E-Access Bulletin has learned.</p>
<p>The report will assess how well departments conform to the
international accessibility guidelines issued by the World Wide Web
Consortium (<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/wai">http://www.w3.org/wai</a>) as well as the
government's own guidelines developed by the Office of the e-Envoy
(<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/webg">http://fastlink.headstar.com/webg</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremy Lonsdale, the NAO official who is currently drafting the
report, said the audit will extend beyond web services to other
electronic media. "We are also picking up on issues relating to
digital television," he said. In coming to its conclusions, the
audit office will draw on the input of the RNIB and Age Concern,
Lonsdale said.</p>
<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">*6: COUNSELLING SERVICE
HITS THE WEB.</a></h1>
<p>A new web site aimed at helping those providing emotional and
psychological support services to visually impaired people, and
improving access to their services, has been launched by the
RNIB.</p>
<p>The site (<a href=
"http://www.unifiedlinks.com/~rnib">http://www.unifiedlinks.com/~rnib</a>)
is being developed to provide training information for counsellors;
news about the latest research; information on how to find a local
counsellor; and discussion forums. Set up by the RNIB's emotional
support division, it is aimed at both sighted counsellors and those
who are themselves visually impaired; and at visually impaired
people seeking support either for problems relating to their sight
loss or on other issues.</p>
<p>The writer Sue Townsend, speaking at the site's launch, said:
"As soon as someone gives you the diagnosis that you are losing
your sight, you need a support system."</p>
<p>Since the site's launch last month there have been technical
problems with accessing it, said Teresa Nicholls, an RNIB
counsellor. However once the teething problems have been sorted
out, stage two of the service's development will include an online
library of case histories and articles by counsellors working with
visually impaired clients.</p>
<h1><a name="section-11." id="section-11.">*7: US TAX FORMS BYPASS
ACCESS REGULATIONS.</a></h1>
<p>The US tax office will not require companies offering online tax
return services to comply with access requirements applying to
other government services, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Internal Revenue Service official Terry Lutes said it will be up
to companies providing online filing to decide whether or not they
will comply with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, a law
requiring US government agencies to provide accessible
services.</p>
<p>Lutes' comments came at a meeting of the Council for Electronic
Revenue Communication Advancement in Arlington held shortly after
the unveiling of an agreement on 30 October which allows companies
to supply online filing<br />

Julie Howell, internet campaigns</a></h1>
officer at the RNIB, has written to respond to Ian Lloyd's
criticisms of the winners of the British Academy of Film and
Television Arts accessibility awards (see E-Access Bulletin,
September and October 2002). Howell, who was on the judging panel
for these awards, says: "I don't dispute Ian's criticisms. Very few
of the candidate sites were 100 per cent accessible and this was
disappointing.
<p>"However, judges in this situation have to select a shortlist
from those sites that are submitted for the award. That's not to
say that the BAFTA shortlist represented the best of a bad bunch,
rather the best of a fairly limited bunch of varying quality.</p>
<p>"I agree that we need to raise the standard. To do this, we need
more organisations that produce accessible sites to put themselves
forward for nomination. The awards run by BAFTA; the British
Interactive Multimedia Association (<a href=

Jane Fleming, a bulletin reader who likes</a></h1>

recent reporting of the first ever audio description services on
ordinary analogue television from the BBC (see E-Access Bulletin,
October 2002).
<p>"Text narrative in BBC analogue? I thought we were all expected
to go digital, satellite and so on, so the government could sell
the analogue off. What is the point of analogue if it will expire

<p><strong>HIGH STREET LOTTERY.</strong><br />
by Mel Poluck <a href=
"mailto:mel@headstar.com">mel@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>The process of buying a new computer or mobile phone on the high
street can be difficult at the best of times, as you struggle to
work out which is the best tariff or simply try to attract the
attention of one of the overworked sales staff.</p>
<p>For visually impaired people, there are added difficulties and
these are sometimes made worse by a lack of awareness among store
employees of what different people's needs might be.</p>
<p>The majority of visually impaired computer users rely on a small
number of specialist services to install special applications after
they have bought the machine, often with guidance from the RNIB �
but they still have to buy the computer in the first place, and
that will usually mean a trip to the high street.</p>
<p>"I can't remember when I had previously felt so alienated and
marginalised when trying to buy something on the high street," said
one E-Access Bulletin reader of his experience of buying a home
computer from a branch of Dixons.</p>
<p>"The shop assistants could spout on with great enthusiasm, once
I said I wanted to make music using the computer. They said: 'I've
got this fantastic programme, you can do A, B, C . . . X, Y, Z with
it. But it's visual I'm afraid, so you would probably have problems
if you tried to use it.'</p>
<p>"By contrast, he didn't even know the difference between voice
activation and speech output! In other words, he could tell me
everything about the parts of the PC I'd be unable to use, and
nothing about the parts of the software that were essential to me
as a blind user. I dared not ask him about the keyboard. I think I
bought the PC in spite of, rather than because of the information I
received at the shop. I got the impression he thought that 'The
Blind' would have provided me with a 'special' computer."</p>
<p>Not everyone's experiences are negative. Another blind reader
was pleased with her experience at The Link mobile phone shop, part
of the same retail group as Dixons.</p>
<p>"The assistant was extremely helpful from the outset and showed
me a variety of phones, paying particular attention to their layout
and the usability of the keys. Once I had made my choice, the
assistant not only spent some considerable time setting up the
phone, she showed me how to use it and allowed me to ring the
store's land line to get the feel of it. I left the store feeling
that I had received an excellent service and felt confident enough
to use the phone."</p>
<p>The variation in service is likely to be caused by gaps in staff
training from one outlet to another. The Dixons Group (<a href=
"http://www.dixonsgroup">http://www.dixonsgroup</a> -plc.co.uk),
whose subsidiaries also include Currys and PC World, does have a
programme of staff training on new products but this does not
appear to include training on disability.</p>
<p>However, the group does have a disability working group cutting
across all access issues. The group is currently working on a best
practice audit, in association with the Disability Rights
Commission, and recently carried out a 'mystery shopper' exercise
in association with the disability advocacy group POhWER, to see
how accessible their shops are.</p>
<p>The 'shoppers' made a range of enquiries and purchases, before
reporting back to the company with their experiences. Among 56
volunteers with disabilities who took part in this exercise, just
one was visually impaired, but Dixons acknowledged that the
experiences of this blind person had uncovered some key
shortfalls.</p>
<p>The project's co-ordinator Jane Dellow said the visually
impaired participant "had the most traumatic experience". He was
left for a long time unattended by staff and in some shops led by
the hand and told to "look" at products.</p>
<p>These findings would feed into improvements in future working
practices, Dellow said, in particular their staff training
system.</p>
<p>Guidance from the Disability Rights Commission suggests
adjustments retailers should consider include providing appropriate
or additional training for staff; modifying or adapting equipment
potentially used by disabled people in stores; and making service
literature and instructions more accessible, by for example making
Braille versions available.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson at the British Retail Consortium,
every major retailer is looking at current policy to keep up to
date with the Disability Discrimination Act, which will shortly
require that visually impaired people should receive the same level
of customer service as sighted people. It may not be possible to
train every member of staff, he says, but the requirement to made
'reasonable adjustments' is spurring training in this area.</p>
<p>The availability of product literature in Braille is
inconsistent across outlets. While it is available from Dixons
group retailers, and the mobile phone operator and retail chain
T-Mobile (formerly One2One), the Time company � manufacturers of
Tiny computers, Time computers and owners of the high street chain
Computer World � do not produce any.</p>
<p>Time does say, however, that its stores' aisles are kept clear
and staff are encouraged to show customers large fonts, large
screens and "help blind people around the shop". In future it may
take a little more than this from retailers everywhere if they are
to keep one step ahead of the law.</p>

<p><strong>MUSEUMS WITHOUT WALLS.</strong><br />
by Jemima Kiss <a href=
"mailto:jemimakiss@hotmail.com">jemimakiss@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>The hosting this month of a seminar at the Tate Modern for
museum and art gallery managers on improving access for visually
impaired people � 'challenging ocularcentricity', as the blurb has
it � is a welcome development (see story 4, E-Access Bulletin,
October 2002).</p>
<p>The UK's museum sector is making slow progress in adapting its
exhibits for visually impaired visitors, despite the requirements
of the 1998 Disability Discrimination Act to improve access for
disabled people to all organisations and services open to the
public. Although most of the requirements of this legislation will
not be compulsory until 2004, there currently appears to be a
substantial gap between provision and demand which makes the
deadline seem unrealistic.</p>
<p>Geof Armstrong, director of the National Disability Arts Forum
(<a href="http://www.ndaf.org">http://www.ndaf.org</a>) which aims
to create equality of opportunity in all aspects of the arts, says
the task is daunting. With some 1.7 million blind or partially
sighted people in the UK, institutions "are so awed by the
implications that they put off serious action", he says.</p>
<p>Even where serious money is being spent on accessibility, the
visually impaired are often overlooked. The Brighton Museum &amp;
Art Gallery, for example, recently underwent a ten million pound
renovation, providing improved access for visitors in wheelchairs
and updating exhibits with interactive features including touch
screen displays and listening posts. But despite these new
facilities, the 'full disabled access' advertised by the museum
makes no provision for visuallyimpaired visitors.</p>
<p>The museum presents a typical example of problems faced by blind
or partially-sighted visitors. Most galleries have necessarily low
lighting to protect exhibits, prohibit visitors from touching items
on display and provide audio guides based on the assumption that
the visitor has full vision. Touch screen displays use small fonts
on low contrast screens which are unreadable for most
visually-impaired visitors, and listening posts assume that the
visitor has read introductory text on nearby exhibits. Although
staff at the Brighton museum are very willing to help, and will
escort people with disabilities around the museum, many blind
visitors feel happier when good facilities allow them to visit
independently.</p>
<p>Standard audio guides for able-bodied visitors give background
information on the artist and explanations of the symbolism and
ideas expressed in the work. Visually impaired visitors need a more
practical description to allow them to build their own image of the
layout and techniques used in the piece, but also need a delicate
and understanding description of the more subtle elements of a work
to express the mood and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some organisations are working to address these issues.
VocalEyes (<a href=
"http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk">http://www.vocaleyes.co.uk</a>) is a
UK audio description company working mainly with theatrical
performance and live productions, which uses specially trained
actors to concisely describe sight-based details such as visual
jokes and set changes during shows. Keen to expand their services
to other arts events, VocalEyes recently worked with the Kettle's
Yard Gallery in Cambridge and then the Whitworth Art Gallery in
Manchester to produce an audio guide accompaniment for an
exhibition of paintings and reliefs by the British artist Ben
Nicholson. Alongside the descriptions, delivered through a handset,
tactile images are used to give visually impaired people a more
complete understanding of each work. The exhibition is on until 15
December in Manchester (for further information, telephone 0161
2757450).</p>
<p>Some of the UK's larger national cultural institutions have also
been making progress. The British Museum<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk">http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk</a>),
for example, offer not only a high contrast text-only website and
large print guides, but a touch tour for the Roman and Egyptian
sculpture galleries, which allows visually impaired visitors direct
contact with the exhibits. It has also developed a sound-guide
system for the Parthenon Galleries accompanied by a touch-section
using 'Tiresias' software (<a href=
"http://www.cs.unc.edu/~hedlund/comp145/homes/blind3">http://www.cs.unc.edu/~hedlund/comp145/homes/blind3</a>)
that translates ancient Greek and Latin texts into Braille.</p>
<p>The Tate group of galleries is also innovating. As well as touch
tours, audio guides, large print guides and reading aids such as
magnifying cameras, its iMap website (<a href=
"http://www.tate.org.uk/imap">http://www.tate.org.uk/imap</a>)
contains visually enhanced images and data which can be used with a
Braille printer to create raised images, derived from drawings by
Picasso and Matisse. Last month the site won the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts' first award for web site accessibility
(see E-Access Bulletin, October 2002). In the six weeks since iMap
was launched more than 2,000 people downloaded the site's line
drawings for use as raised images, compared to the few hundred
visually impaired people who might visit the gallery each year.</p>
<p>Caro Howell, special projects curator at Tate Modern, says the
most valuable element of access programmes is to encourage a
personal engagement with the artwork. "There is little critical
thinking about gallery education and visual impairment and a lack
of developed methods. There needs to be greater emphasis on
intellectual access. The web offers an exciting opportunity for
delivering tailor-made and in-depth explorations of artworks that
visually impaired people can explore independently."</p>

FORMATTING</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>READER SURVEY.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPROVING THE SERVICE.</strong><br />
by Dan Jellinek <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Our recent reader consultation on the formatting of E-Access
Bulletin produced lots of valuable feedback. Our existing format
met with strong approval overall, but we do now propose to
incorporate a few improvements suggested by readers, from our next
issue. We also propose to move on to develop a draft 'email
newsletter access standard' that may be used by others � more of
this at the end of the article.</p>
<p>The formatting survey was initially triggered by a suggestion
from one reader, Peter Link, that web addresses should be moved
from within the text of stories to a list at the end of each
article.</p>
<p>It seems that this is not a suggestion favoured by the majority
of readers, however. Of the responses, 47 per cent were in favour
of retaining the addresses as they are, compared with 24 per cent
who would favour them placed at the end of stories. A further 6 per
cent said the addresses should be both within the copy and at the
end of stories, and 4 per cent said there should be an additional
list at the end of the newsletter of all the links in the entire
issue. The other 19 per cent had no preference.</p>
<p>There is therefore no strong mandate for changing where we
present the web links, although if we have the resources in future
we propose to experiment with offering multiple formats so people
will be able to choose their favourite. We cannot predict exactly
when we will be able to do this.</p>
<p>Moving on to whether or not we need to include full web
addresses, including '<a href="http://www">http://www</a>' at the
beginning for example, there was a strong majority in favour of
retaining the longer formats. Two thirds of respondents (67 per
cent) were in favour of this, mainly because some email packages
such as Lotus Notes seem to only recognise the full versions as
links.</p>
<p>The other third (33 per cent) of respondents did think it would
be fine to do without '<a href="http://">http://</a>' or '<a href=
"http://www">http://www</a>' unless the full address was different
from the usual formulations, but on balance we have decided to
stick with the full addresses to ensure accessibility by all forms
of software.</p>
<p>Some 15 respondents suggested we produce a simple HTML version
of the newsletter alongside the plain text version, allowing live
links plus internal links from the contents to relevant stories. We
think this is a good idea, and as with the alternative web address
placings will strive to introduce such a version as an opt-in
alternative as and when resources allow. We will also consider
subsequently producing a Microsoft Word version as well, as this
may apparently work even better with some access technologies.</p>
<p>Most respondents like our use of an asterisk to mark the
beginnings of stories and sections, but there were two suggestions
for adaptations to this device that seem like good
improvements.</p>
<p>The first is a suggestion to change from using asterisks to the
# (or 'hash') symbol. The reason for this suggestion, as explained
by reader John Gardner in the US, is that the asterisk character is
often used as a 'wild card' character in searches, so sometimes if
you search for say</p>
<h1><a name="section-25." id="section-25.">'*1' which we might be
using to mark a story, a search may take the</a></h1>
asterisk to be a wild card and just find any place where a
character was next to a '1'.
<p>"My guess is that everybody could search and find #1 but that
many</p>
<h1><a name="section-26." id="section-26.">search engines wouldn't
find *1", Gardner says. So unless any reader</a></h1>
contacts us with strong reasons why we should not do this, we
propose to make that change from our next issue.
<p>A further refinement is suggested by Gerry Chevalier of Canada.
He</p>
<h1><a name="section-27." id="section-27.">says: "I do indeed
appreciate the '*' special character as it allows me to</a></h1>
use the FIND-NEXT search of my email client. However, I might
<h1><a name="section-28." id="section-28.">suggest that you could
use '***' to tag a main section and '**' to tag a</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-29." id="section-29.">section and '*' to tag
an individual item. That way, I could search say,</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-30." id="section-30.">for '***' if I wished to
skip an entire section."</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-31." id="section-31.">We think that this idea,
using the new # characters rather than the *, is</a></h1>
a good one, and so will from the next time use ### at the beginning
of the issue and the beginning of the notes at the very end of the
issue; ## for a section beginning; and # for a headline beginning
an individual article.
<p>There are four other points of formatting or style for increased
accessibility we propose to adopt in addition to our existing
rules, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All paragraphs to end with a full stop, even if the last word
is a web or email address.</li>
<li>Never to use &lt;&gt; tags for web addresses.</li>
<li>Where possible, to write compound words or phrases as separate
words, for example saying 'home page' rather than 'homepage', as
compound words can confuse screen readers and produce odd
pronunciations.</li>
<li>The minimisation of the introductory text we put at the top of
each issue, before we get to the issue proper.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's about it. Thanks very much to everyone who provided
feedback. And as well as incorporating the improvements from our
next issue where indicated above, we also now propose to draft an
'email newsletter access standard' which could be continually
improved according to an ongoing process of consultation, and
adopted by other organisations who find it useful. Headstar, the
publishers of EAccess Bulletin, will be happy to maintain the
standard in partnership with any interested bodies � if you are
interested in supporting the project, please contact the bulletin's
editor Dan Jellinek on <a href=
"mailto:dan@headstar.com">dan@headstar.com</a>. The first draft
standard will be published on the web next month, with full details
provided in our next issue.</p>
