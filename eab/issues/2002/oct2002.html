<h1><a name="section-4." id="section-4.">* SECTION ONE:</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">*1: FREE AND FAIR
ELECTIONS?</a></h1>
<p>A Bill of Electoral Rights for People with Disabilities
(<a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/elec">http://fastlink.headstar.com/elec</a>)
has been drafted by disability rights activists and election
administration officials from more than 24 countries as part of a
global initiative to make political processes more accessible.</p>
<p>The bill aims to define and promote the rights of people with
disabilities in relation to all aspects of the electoral process,
in particular the right to a secret vote and full physical
accessibility of polling stations. The content, agreed at a
conference in Sweden on September 14 (see pdf document at <a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/conf">http://fastlink.headstar.com/conf</a>
), is intended to be a template for reforming electoral regulations
in participating countries.</p>
<p>The move will be met with interest by disability campaigners in
the UK who are tracking ongoing trials here of electronic voting
after concerns about their potential lack of accessibility (see
E-Access Bulletin, May 2002). There were also concerns about the
reliability and correct use of special new tactile voting templates
after the last UK general election (see E-Access Bulletin, August
2001).</p>
<p>According to Sarah Gull of the UK Electoral Commission, the
Swedish meeting allowed participants to report progress in their
own countries and discover ideas for good practice from others.
"For example, there were some interesting ideas about polling
stations. In the UK a voter has to go to their nominated polling
station, but some countries � such as Australia � have experimented
with mobile polling stations. In the Ukraine, they have set them up
in hospitals," she said.</p>
<p>The conference was co-organised by International IDEA (<a href=
"http://www.idea.int">http://www.idea.int</a>), the independent
institute for democracy and electoral assistance set up by 14
governments, with US-funded advisory body the International
Foundation for Election Systems (<a href=
"http://www.ifes.org">http://www.ifes.org</a>).</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">*2: FIRST DESCRIPTION
SERVICE FOR ANALOGUE TV.</a></h1>
<p>For the first time, UK viewers will be able to access
audio-described programmes on ordinary analogue TV when BBC2
screens 'Free wheelers', 'The man who learned to see' and 'One in
seven' from the recent 'What's your problem?' season of programmes
on attitudes towards disability, on Tuesday 5 November (<a href=
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/wyp">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/wyp</a>).</p>
<p>Plans to develop further audio-described TV services over the
next 10 years are a current bone of contention between blindness
groups and those drafting new government regulations in a
Communications Bill that will shape access to digital media for the
visually impaired (see EAccess Bulletin, July and August 2002).</p>
<p>The RNIB says targets for accessible TV in the current draft of
the bill (see <a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/com">http://fastlink.headstar.com/com</a>)
are too low, don't scale up fast enough, and aren't backed by a
strong commitment by regulators.</p>
<p>According to Caroline Ellis of the RNIB, the November screenings
are an opportunity for visually impaired people to experience
audiodescribed TV and request more of the services. "People should
write to the BBC. If enough people show support for audio-described
analogue services it will be difficult for the BBC to resist doing
more and increase pressure on the government to set higher targets
for digital services," she said.</p>
<p>The RNIB is also targeting the House of Lords to make the
necessary changes to the draft Bill. "There is a reasonable chance
of a coalition between the Liberal Democrats and the Tories," said
Ellis. The Liberal Democrats unanimously supported all key demands
by the RNIB at their recent annual conference (<a href=

<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">*3: VISUGATE
OPENS.</a></h1>
<p>A UK-based web site with ambitions to become the definitive
online source of information on blindness launched this month.</p>
<p>Visugate (<a href=
"http://www.visugate.org">http://www.visugate.org</a>) is initially
offering 'metadata' descriptions in text and audio formats on
existing information from 19 sources, including E-Access Bulletin,
plus a search engine to aid navigation. Features planned for
introduction in the months to come include information for special
interest groups, job hunters and shoppers. Spin-off services
include a Visual Impairment Learning Centre which will create and
pilot web-based educational resources, and a Visual Impairment
Library of Research (VILOR) (see E-Access Bulletin, December 2001
for further information on both these projects).</p>
<p>The launch took place on 10 October, World Sight Day (<a href=
"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/pr79/en">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/pr79/en</a>),
an annual World Health Organisation event to promote the prevention
and treatment of blindness. The day focused on the developing
world, home to the majority of the world's blind people. For an
insight into the mixture of hope and frustration experienced by
visually impaired people in developing countries as they attempt to
access technology see 'Divided we stand,' section four, this
issue.</p>
<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">*4: OPENING UP THE
ARTS.</a></h1>
<p>Despite their widespread adoption of internet and mobile
technology to relay additional non-visual information to visitors,
most museums and art galleries have yet to find the right
information to relay to a visually impaired audience.</p>
<p>All museums now need to take steps to allow visually impaired
visitors to appreciate their exhibitions to comply with the
Disability Discrimination Act. To help them tackle these issues,
the Tate Modern gallery in London is hosting a series of four
seminars with the first, 'Challenging ocularcentricity in the
museum', due to take place on 1 November.</p>
<p>Among the biggest difficulties in creating non-visual
descriptions come when trying to describe works of visual art which
contain few references to the real world, says Tate Modern's
special project curator Caro Howell. To help to home in a solution,
the seminar will consider if museums can find an "aesthetic model
that is embodied and includes smell, touch, taste, hearing, rhythm
and balance".</p>
<p>The Tate sees itself as a leader in this field, having this
month won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts' first
award for web site accessibility for its 'iMap' site. The site
(<a href=
"http://www.tate.org.uk/imap">http://www.tate.org.uk/imap</a>)
contains visually enhanced images and data which can be used to
create raised images, derived from drawings by Picasso and
Matisse.</p>

<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">*5: HEYANITA HITS
EUROPE.</a></h1>
<p>US voice technology company HeyAnita (<a href=
"http://www.heyanita.com">http://www.heyanita.com</a>) is the
latest firm in the 'web speech' sector to make a move into the
European market, following the arrival last year of Europe's first
comprehensive voice-accessed web portal Eckoh (<a href=
"http://www.eckoh.com">http://www.eckoh.com</a> - see E-Access
Bulletin August 2001 and September 2001).</p>
<p>The speech-web sector is still not taking off in Europe however,
according to one observer. "It isn't an increasing market in my
view. Europe is quite far behind and dare I say they're getting
worse," says Bob McDowell business and technology consultant to
Bloor Research. Mc Dowell has predicted in the past that Europe as
a whole is at least 18 months behind the US in the speech web
field.</p>
<p>"The European market is not one market � you've got a very
different climate in each country, and one needs a much more
country by country focus," he said. "It is also much more highly
regulated which is an inhibiting factor."</p>
<p>HeyAnita's expansion has so far gone as far as a small 'London'
office near Newbury � actually some way outside the capital. "We
anticipate organic growth into other countries � most likely
Germany, France, Spain and Southern Africa," a spokesperson told
E-Access Bulletin. "Interest in the first six weeks has been very
high."</p>
<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">*6: COPYRIGHT BILL
COMPLETES FINAL STAGES.</a></h1>
<p>A bill to allow the limited non-profit production of accessible
digital versions of copyright material passed through its final
Parliamentary stages on 11 October (see also E-Access Bulletin,
March 2002 and July 2002).</p>
<p>The Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Bill is expected to be
given Royal Assent in the next few months and come into force in
the first half of next year, according to RNIB campaigns officer
David Mann.</p>
<p>The government is planning a consultation next month to create
guidance on the new law. Meanwhile, copyright holders have invited
producers of accessible formats<br />
(<a href=

<h1><a name="section-18." id="section-18.">*12: AWARDS ANALYSED:
E-Government Bulletin reader Ian</a></h1>
Lloyd writes in with a personal assessment of the sites which were
short-listed for the first ever British Academy of Film and
Television Arts accessibility awards (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/bafta">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bafta</a>
) (see also news, last month and this issue).
<p>"I was somewhat surprised, they were a mixed bag," he said. "The
first finalist - the UK Audio Network - was exactly the kind of
innovative use of sound that I would expect to get a well deserved
pat on the back. However the second, I-map [the eventual winner],
was not exactly intuitive. For example, the page title - 'Welcome'
� begged the question, welcome to what exactly? Tabbing through the
links gave me: 'Introduction' (again, to what I ask?) and so
on.</p>
<p>"Nomination three was Foodlink, which has a nice clean design,
but again faults were spotted. For example, the options labelled 1
to 4 were not read out in sequence, and some of the 'alt' tag
attributes were incorrect. Nomination four is the BBC's 'Ouch!'
site. Anyway, the first thing that greeted me was 'homepage' as the
page's title tag. It would be much nicer as 'home page' � two
separate words - so the screen reader pronounced it correctly,
instead of 'hommapuj'. Until we have greater control over
pronunciation, I would suggest breaking words like these into two
words that the screen reader understands.</p>
<p>"In the body of the page, there were some links that could have
benefited from some additional help in the form of a title
attribute - in particular the links that were people's names. In
defence of Ouch, with several updates a week it's understandable
that the occasional title attribute gets missed out. All in all
though, is this the best in accessibility? I am not so sure."

Gucukoglu, also the author of a feature in this week's bulletin,
has further information about accessing the internet by email,
following our piece last issue on Google's new email search option.
<p>"There are many good reasons to use email only to do everything
on the internet," he says. "Some users in third-world countries or
with otherwise limited-bandwidth connections, or those in
organisations which provide email only, have no other option.
Others find that waiting on a connection to an outside server is
best left up to a robot, keeping them from lagging online.</p>
<p>"It also brings immense benefits to the blind, especially to
those who enjoyed the older operating systems or using portable
devices. Some just find that the format of the e-mail is more
appealing in plain text than as presented in their browsers.</p>

<h1><a name="section-23." id="section-23.">*17: GENEROUS ALLOWANCE?
Our focus last issue on access to</a></h1>
learning (story 13, section four, September issue), and
specifically our coverage of the disabled students allowance (DSA),
struck a chord with several readers.
<p>Steve Brazier from Nottingham said: "I am visually impaired and
began an Open University Course in February, aiming for a diploma
in German. I was sent the DSA forms and filled them in, not
expecting too much. I had already taught myself to use a PC and had
access software.</p>
<p>"I was assessed at Lincoln University's DART centre in January.
Although I didn't think I needed much, the centre not only
recommended a laptop but also an upgrade to most of my existing
system. They also recommended specialist learning software that
meant I could scan in text and abstract vocabulary - something I
had been helped with before by my wife reading marked up textbooks
out while I touch-typed everything into the PC, which took
hours.</p>
<p>"The whole list was approved and I got the new equipment in
April. It has been extremely valuable and has made me more or less
totally independent in my studies. Most impressive was the way they
saw through my 'modest' request and realised I was just getting by
before. I hope this may be of interest in persuading other VI
students to fill in the form."</p>
<p>However, not all students have had good experiences. Jane
Fleming of Whittlesey said: "I am a UK postgraduate, part-time,
doing an MA in Urban Geography at London External (correspondence
part of University of London). I do not receive a penny in DSA, nor
any help from the extensive student support part of the Senate. The
only assistance I have had is the grant from the RNIB to upgrade my
screenreader software. Students come in all shapes, abilities and
sizes."</p>

FOCUS</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>TECHNOLOGY AT HOME.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SMART LIVING.</strong><br />
by Tamara Fletcher <a href=
"mailto:tamara@headstar.com">tamara@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Imagine waking up in the morning and using a single control
panel by the bed to make a phone call; turn the radio on; start the
bath running (safe in the knowledge the taps will turn themselves
off at the right time); and switch on the kettle. Welcome to life
in a smart home.</p>
<p>As well as convenience, smart technologies have the potential to
make the home a much safer and more convenient place for people
with visual impairments. Audio interfaces, for example, could tell
a user when the bath is too hot or give audio prompts when the oven
is left on.</p>
<p>On leaving the house, a signal from a key fob could turn on the
security alarm, close any open windows, and make sure all the doors
are locked. If there is a gas leak, or if a ring on the cooker
blows out, detectors in the house would turn the gas off at the
mains activating a warning alarm. In addition, any of the features
of a smart home could eventually be linked to the internet via
wireless connections, and hence be accessed by or communicate with
a user via mobile phone or workplace computer.</p>
<p>The John Grooms housing association<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.johngrooms.org.uk">http://www.johngrooms.org.uk</a>), a
charity providing 1,200 accessible homes to people with
disabilities, is optimistic about the future of smart homes.
"Technology will get cheaper. We are always pushing for councils to
be more aware of the needs of their disabled constituents. I think
it should take off in the next few years," a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>A jointly funded smart homes project with Portsmouth City
Council, Portsmouth University and John Grooms has seen the
development of six two-bed flats, three with full smart technology
and three partly developed and adapted to individual needs, at the
north end of the city. Presently, none of these cater for people
with visual impairment specifically but have many functions which
could be of benefit to this group.</p>
<p>Rather than twisting taps, for example, a pre-programmed button
can measure out exactly how much water you need to fill a cup.
Doors can recognise when they are obstructed, and entrance systems
do not require awkward locks.</p>
<p>Social smart homes are not widely available, however, and roll
out of non-commercial applications in housing is slow. Dr John
Gill, chief scientist at the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, told E-Access Bulletin: "The industry is beset by lack of a
single standard for the network � currently there are a vast number
of different competing and incompatible systems."</p>
<p>Gill says retrofitting an old house is a "nightmare" due to
excessive cabling. The life expectancy of technology is another
problem for people with disabilities because users would expect the
system to stay current for at least 10-15 years, whereas the
suppliers could update or switch systems within a year.</p>
<p>"Demand for the government to scrap analogue TV and switch to
digital may help the roll out of smart technologies in the home
because the common standard used for the TV will be used for
everything else," he said.</p>
<p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.jrf.org.uk/housingtrust/smarthomes">http://www.jrf.org.uk/housingtrust/smarthomes</a>)
in conjunction with Sussex University (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/smart">http://fastlink.headstar.com/smart</a>),
are currently running a series of demonstration projects with
disabled people to assess reliability of available smart
technologies in the home.</p>
<p>According to the foundation's policy and practice manager Julie
Cowans, "smart technologies have a huge potential role if suppliers
and manufacturers can get to grips with the user interface thing.
The devices are not all user friendly yet � you need a degree in
computer programming to operate some of this stuff."</p>
<p>Another problem is cost, Cowans says. "Suppliers and installers
give bespoke systems to each user and they are incredibly expensive
� the industry looks to the commercial entertainment market where
there's a wealth of products available but they've drawn a blank
with the domestic market. A housing association would struggle to
find a realistic way to support the costs," she says.</p>
<p>"Five years down the line things will get better, when it
becomes less of a niche market. Currently the very biggest players
like BT, Siemens and Echelon feel that the market is not mature
enough to devote resources to," she says.</p>
<p>An example of one of the foundation's projects in conjunction
with Edinvar housing association is the Edinvar flat in Edinburgh
(<a href=
"http://www.gdewsbury.ukideas.com/Edinvarflatplan.html">http://www.gdewsbury.ukideas.com/Edinvarflatplan.html</a>).
The organisation is also in talks with York University about the
creation of a national centre of home automation.</p>
<p>Even once the technology is 100 per cent reliable, for smart
housing in a social context to grow in the UK as it has in certain
northern European countries, the government may need to be
convinced that savings in institutional care can offset hardware
and support costs.</p>
<p>One US smart homes company, Automated Living (<a href=
"http://www.automatedliving.com">http://www.automatedliving.com</a>),
prides itself in the apparent simplicity of its voice technology
products. "Someone who is not sighted would need help setting the
system up, but it's so simple to do even somebody's mother could do
it. Our systems do not rely on dictation technology but use speaker
independent technology programmed with a very narrow syntax, which
drives down the margin for error," a spokesman said. The company's
most expensive product is 399 US dollars.</p>
<p>However the Rowntree foundation's experience has been very
different, says Cowans. "There are a lot of exciting things in the
pipeline with voice technologies and voice activated systems but we
felt things were still a little too unreliable. It took one of the
people in the demo 50 hours to get used to the system he trialled,
and then he got a cold and it couldn't recognise his voice."</p>

<p><strong>DIVIDED WE STAND.</strong><br />

<p>The prospect of further globalisation makes it imperative that
visually impaired people, regardless of their nationality, have
access to technology allowing them to operate on equal terms with
their sighted counterparts. But achieving this will be tough,
particularly in developing countries, home to some 90 per cent of
the world's visually impaired people, according to the World Health
Organisation, with over nine million living in India; six million
in China and seven million in Africa.</p>
<p>Screen magnification tools, Braille displays and embossers, and
specially designed input devices have made it possible for visually
impaired people to use computers, offering unprecedented
possibilities in education, employment and recreation. But, for
most visually impaired people, the costs of obtaining and using
such devices remain prohibitively high, not least because of the
added cost of training and software upgrades.</p>
<p>It follows that those from poorer countries are faced with the
biggest problems, made worse by the fact that visually impaired
people in developing countries tend come from the more economically
disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Among the most costly items of access technology are Braille
writing equipment and high tech devices, such as Braille displays
and embossers. It is not true, as some would say, that these
devices are of no special use to a blind person unless he were also
deaf. As a university lecturer, for instance, I find it extremely
awkward to read teaching notes or record research interviews using
synthetic speech. Furthermore, hard copy Braille is too inflexible
to permit regular updating or adaptation to unplanned classroom
conditions.</p>
<p>Even with hard copy Braille, the source of literacy for
thousands, costs have risen astronomically in recent years, partly
as a result of people in the West switching to audio technology.
Hard copy Braille is supplied to users in the developed world a
price well above the cost price charged by Western organisations,
such as the RNIB, who continue to offer generous discounts to local
readers. Nevertheless the majority of the Braille community in the
developing world cannot afford to adopt the alternatives.</p>
<p>As a Classics professor at the University of Peradeniya in Sri
Lanka (<a href="http://www.pdn.ac.lk">http://www.pdn.ac.lk</a>), I
am fortunate to receive a salary of around 200 UK pounds a month
which I have saved to purchase the equipment I need. Even with my
salary, however, I have only been able to do this because I have
been prepared to sacrifice many other good things of life which
money could buy.</p>
<p>The equipment I use includes two personal computers (one at home
and one at the office), on Apollo II synthesizer (remember the DOS
days), HAL and Window-Eyes screen-reader software (with almost
annual upgrades), a scanner and Open Book Unbound (with upgrades),
four-track cassette recorders and a Mountbatten Brailler. I have
also bought a number of multi-volume Greek and Latin books in
Braille at colossal prices, and whatever I could not purchase I
have copied with my own hands from less than perfect dictations by
sighted persons whom I pay.</p>
<p>I do not approve of what many people do in India, namely to take
software like JAWS and Kurzweil Reader, pirate them, and sell them
to blind people at a tenth of the retail price. I have done
whatever I can to stop people in Sri Lanka from pirating access
software. I have been successful so far, but the result is that
only a handful of people have computers with HAL.</p>
<p>All in all then, at present, access technology is an
unaffordable and so ultimately frustrating experience for the great
majority of visually impaired people in the developing world</p>

HIGHER EDUCATION</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>COURSE SELECTION.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXTRA HOMEWORK REQUIRED.</strong><br />
by Sabahattin Gucukoglu</p>
<p>Like many blind people, in choosing a university to attend I was
drawn to the ideal projected by my favoured institution of
integration, involvement and equality with my non-disabled peers.
Failure in my fresher's year as a computer science student,
however, has led me to doubt the decision-making process that many,
perhaps most, visually impaired people use when choosing where to
study.</p>
<p>There are too many factors contributing to my downfall to
describe them all here. But high among them is that the 'gut
reaction' which informed my choice of university and course was
inappropriate.</p>
<p>Like most would-be students, my choice of university was made
largely on the grounds of personal preferences, false assurances
and a lack of attention to the detail given in the prospectus. But,
I have learned, going through this standard decision-making process
is not necessarily enough for a visually impaired person. To
maximise the chances of success, you need to do more than examine
the paperwork and attend a few routine meetings about your special
needs.</p>
<p>One must be cautious in basing one's decision on the apparent
helpfulness of a special needs assessment. I have learned that it
may have little to do with the university's provision once you are
there. My own assessment was very promising, but I soon discovered
you are pretty much out in the wild once it is over. Alarm bells
too should ring if you hear that your department and your special
needs group hardly talk to each other, because it is crucial they
are in close co-operation.</p>
<p>Be wary too if you are hear that exceptional intelligence is the
only thing which will pull you through. If, like me, you are
optimistic and obliging, you might find yourself working unduly
hard just to prove an inadequate course is actually okay. I'm still
trying to figure out whether I was wrong or just plain stupid.</p>
<p>To make a proper informed decision you need to scrutinise the
detail of special needs support on offer and listen to the
experiences of other students. You, like me, must realise you are
not the only one to have had these experiences.</p>
<p>The consensus among the visually impaired students I talked to
was that universities either understand their needs or they do not.
For example, a university needs to know how visually impaired
people digest course material. Rather than have an explanation
flashed up in front of them like sighted person, visually impaired
students would often prefer to have it all there and read it at a
later stage. If these requirements are known before a visually
impaired student arrives, they would not be difficult to
arrange.</p>
<p>Despite my misgivings, however, I am pleased to say my
university is showing signs that it is motivated to change. It is
working in response to the extension of the Disability
Discrimination Act to education and it has bought in expensive
technology and promised to make things work for me. They have
offered me a place on an e-business course which it is hoped will
present less obstacles to accessibility.</p>
<p>In my opinion, my failure was the price of being a guinea pig,
and I will remain sceptical about the idea that any organisation
proposing to help people with disabilities can guarantee
anything.</p>
