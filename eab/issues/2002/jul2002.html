NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">*1: DIGITAL WATCHDOG NEEDS
SHARPER TEETH.</a></h1>
<p>Proposed new digital communication regulations intended to
safeguard the rights of users do not offer enough protection to
visually impaired people, civil servants were told at a public
meeting organised by the RNIB earlier this week.</p>
<p>A draft Communications Bill<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk/text_only/text_only.html">http://www.communicationsbill.gov.uk/text_only/text_only.html</a>),
due in parliament before the end of the year, replaces regulators
that previously oversaw TV, radio and telecoms services with Ofcom,
a single watchdog which will be responsible for setting
communications licence conditions and standards of service.</p>
<p>Officials from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
and the Department of Trade and Industry were urged repeatedly by
speakers from the floor to require digital TV broadcasters to
increase their quotas of audio-described content and provide
accessible electronic programme guides and set-top boxes.</p>
<p>Concern was expressed that although providers of cable and
satellite TV services will have to match levels of audio-described
content provided by terrestrial broadcasters, these quotas will
remain set at their current levels of 10 per cent. This compares
with an 80 per cent requirement for subtitled content for the
hearing impaired.</p>
<p>In a response which failed to spark much enthusiasm, Liz Ager of
the DCMS confirmed the quota for audio descriptions will be kept
under review. The RNIB confirmed afterwards to E-Access Bulletin
that it will push for an immediate increase in the audio quota to
50 per cent.</p>
<p>Delegates were also concerned to learn that although Ofcom will
have a duty to protect the interests of consumers, it will not have
the power to make service providers offer accessible terminals.</p>
<p>�The distinction between being a service user and a user of
terminal equipment doesn�t make sense,� said Sandy Bannister of the
Worcestershire Association for the Blind. However, according to
RNIB parliamentary officer Caroline Ellis, Ofcom could make it a
requirement that service providers offer terminals which are
compatible with assistive equipment.</p>
<p>Readers can make formal responses to the draft bill until August
2 � email Fiona Murray on <a href=

<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">*2: DISABILITY GUIDELINES
FOR DIGITAL IRELAND.</a></h1>
<p>New accessibility guidelines for digital technologies have been
published by the Irish National Disability Authority (NDA), the
independent statutory body which oversees disability policy in
Ireland.</p>
<p>The guidelines (<a href=
"http://accessit.nda.ie">http://accessit.nda.ie</a>), which aim to
be useful to people who make procurement decisions as well as
technology developers, cover everything from web sites to public
access terminals, telecoms terminals and application software.</p>
<p>The NDA says the initiative adds a new practical dimension to
Irish national and European laws on accessibility, as they are
based on close consultation with users and procurers. An innovative
web-based interface to the document uses hypertext to lead the user
through the guidelines according to who they are and what they are
doing, and the web section annotates and explains often
impenetrable international standards.</p>
<p>�Guidelines like those contained in the Web Accessibility
Initiative (<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/WAI">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a>), are quite
technical and difficult to understand if you are not a developer,�
said project leader Christine Whyte.</p>
<p>According to Whyte, the project took just one year to get off
the ground. The NDA was supported by an advisory board that
included RNIB chief scientist Dr John Gill and commissioned a
private sector partner (<a href=
"http://www.frontend.com">http://www.frontend.com</a>) to conduct
background research and draft the guidelines.</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">*3: SMALL STEPS FORWARD
FOR DIGITAL RADIO.</a></h1>
<p>The UK launch last week of a portable digital radio set at 99
pounds promises to make the medium much more affordable. But
E-Access Bulletin has discovered that the set is only marginally
more accessible to blind people than its more expensive
predecessors.</p>
<p>Those in areas with a digital signal will be able to use the
'EVOKE-1' receiver from VideoLogic Systems (<a href=
"http://www.videologic.co.uk">http://www.videologic.co.uk</a>) to
pick up the 50 or so free-to-air digital services from the BBC
(<a href=
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio">http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio</a>)
and commercial companies (<a href=
"http://www.ukdigitalradio.co.uk">http://www.ukdigitalradio.co.uk</a>).</p>
<p>However, the set does not convert supplementary information
about the content on air into voice output. With no verbal cue,
blind users must select each channel to find out what it is and
memorise the location for future reference.</p>
<p>VideoLogic told E-Access Bulletin this week there are,
nevertheless, several design features of the set which may be
useful to the blind, including its single raised and shaped control
panel, and differing size and shape of its volume and tuning
controls. Further improvements will be added to future models
following discussions with the RNIB, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Whatever the design access issues, digital radio is still not
the answer for everyone because signal coverage is not yet
universal. Even in areas served by a digital transmitter, local
geography can block the signal entirely, unlike analogue where
reception varies on a sliding scale.</p>

<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">*4: TEST LAUNCH FOR
'A-SITES'.</a></h1>
<p>A new online library of accessible web sites has been launched
by the National Library for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.nlbuk.org">http://www.nlbuk.org</a>).</p>
<p>The �A-sites� portal (<a href=
"http://www.a-sites.org">http://www.a-sites.org</a>) has so far
listed 153 accessible sites under 40 different categories ranging
from government to food and drink, with an accessibility rating for
each and a facility for users to recommend other accessible
sites.</p>
<p>Each site is user tested and assessed on a broad range of
criteria including compatibility with magnification and audio
software and Braille keyboards.</p>
<p>After an initial test phase, only sites which are 70 per cent or
more accessible will be linked to the portal. So far just under
half the sites tested make the grade. A cut-off of 80 per cent was
tried initially, but the NLB had to lower the barrier when it found
less than a third of sites complied.</p>
<p>The Canadian National Institute for the Blind (<a href=
"http://www.cnib.ca">http://www.cnib.ca</a>) currently earns the
highest rating so far at 99 per cent. The producers hope to have
found 1,000 A-sites by the portal's launch in October 2002.</p>
<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">*5: CINEMA AUDIO
DESCRIPTION TRIALS EXTENDED.</a></h1>
<p>More films have been added to UK trials of a new system that
makes cinema accessible to visually impaired people, delivering
audio descriptions at adjustable volume through cordless headsets
(See EAccess Bulletin, January 2002).</p>
<p>Described films now include Harry Potter and the Philosopher�s
Stone; Monsters Inc; Ocean's Eleven; Panic Room; Time Machine; Star
Wars Episode II and Spiderman.</p>
<p>Participating cinemas are located in Belfast, Cardiff,
Gateshead, Glasgow, Guildford, London, Pontypridd, Uxbridge and
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>At present, each of the 11 cinemas involved has only one screen
with the trial equipment and only certain films have audio
description. Cinema-goers are strongly advised to ring in advance
to check that their film choice is being shown on the correct
screen, and a small deposit may be required for the use of
headphones. Contact details can be found at <a href=

<h1><a name="section-10." id="section-10.">*6: DOUBLE MONEY FOR
AUDIT SCHEME.</a></h1>
<p>The financial services group Standard Life has doubled its
support for a free web site accessibility audit scheme - run as
part of the RNIB�s �See it right� campaign � in response to high
levels of applications to take part.</p>
<p>The company has raised its support for the scheme from a planned
50,000 pounds in year one to 110,000 pounds, and supplied a second
member of staff on secondment to the scheme to join an existing
person already in position.</p>
<p>Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers (<a href=
"http://www.cbfa.co.uk">http://www.cbfa.co.uk</a>) is the first web
site to successfully pass muster under the scheme, with a second
organisation, the small Scottish internet service provider
�Echoraith� (<a href=
"http://www.echoraith.net">http://www.echoraith.net</a>), due to be
the second.</p>
<p>Under the scheme as originally planned free accessibility audits
were to be offered to around 50 organisations a year for two years
at an estimated cost of between 600 and 1,450 pounds per audit (see
EAccess Bulletin, February 2002). Anyone can apply but
organisations to be audited are selected to represent a
cross-section of sectors including retail, charity, travel,
education, utility and telecommunications, and government.</p>
<p>However after interest from over 200 organisations the extra
funding has been pledged to allow a greater number to join in, with
76 audits already scheduled and 18 completed. The RNIB estimates
that the cost of making the average site accessible following audit
will be between one and two per cent of original design costs. For

Persons) Bill has successfully completed its passage through the
House of Commons and is expected to proceed through the Lords and
pass into law by the end of October. The bill, a backbench measure
which has gained government support, will legalise the limited
nonprofit production of accessible digital versions of copyright
material (see E-Access Bulletin, March 2002). The government has
yet to name a timetable for subsequent introduction of the various

<p>Now Elaine Wilkinson of RNIB Library Services has further
advice: �Although the RNIB is unable to lend directly to
individuals overseas, you can request a library, university or
organisation for the blind in your area to act as an intermediary
on your behalf. Material (cassettes and some Braille) can then sent
by inter-library loan in most cases. For further information please

<p><strong>PORTABLE NOTE-TAKERS SET FOR SEISMIC SHIFT.</strong> by
Derek Parkinson <a href=
"mailto:derek@headstar.com">derek@headstar.com</a></p>
<p>Exhibitors are busy gearing up for Sight Village 2002, the
annual showcase for products and services for the visually
impaired. The exhibition (<a href=
"http://www.qac.ac.uk/sight.htm">http://www.qac.ac.uk/sight.htm</a>)
is free to visitors and will be held at the Queen Alexandra
College, Birmingham from July 16- 18.</p>
<p>With more than 70 organisations setting out their stalls,
visitors are sure to find something of interest, although a series
of talks in the hospitality suite could grab most attention. Staff
of Freedom Scientific (<a href=
"http://www.freedomscientific.com">http://www.freedomscientific.com</a>)
will give daily presentations here, with overviews of features in
the new JAWS 4.5 screen reader and MAGic 8.0 screen magnifier, both
due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting presentation will deal with the
company�s new 'PAC Mate' portable computer for visually impaired
people. The PAC Mate range, based on Microsoft�s Pocket PC
operating system, offers the functions of a Braille note-taker but
is directly compatible with off-the-shelf Microsoft applications
such as Word, Excel, Explorer and Outlook.</p>
<p>According to Kevin Carey of the RNIB, products like PAC Mate
should make communicating by email less error-prone. �The old way
of converting Braille code for email meant that if I made a mistake
typing, it would be almost impossible for my secretary to guess
what I was trying to write,� he says. It should also eliminate the
need for extra equipment.</p>
<p>�At the moment, if I go to a conference, take notes in Braille,
but want to communicate with my secretary by email, I have to carry
around 10 kilograms of stuff in my bag. With a stick in one hand
it�s quite difficult to walk in a straight line � not good on
station platforms,� he says.</p>
<p>By contrast, the PAC Mate is expected to weigh considerably less
� about two kilograms. According to Carey, the new release may be
the start of a seismic shift for note-takers, with rival
manufacturers forced to follow the same route to keep their share
of the market.</p>
<p>Other interesting new developments for note-takers will be
demonstrated by Pulse Data<br />
(<a href=
"http://www.pulsedata.co.nz/index.cfm/11,html">http://www.pulsedata.co.nz/index.cfm/11,html</a>),
with products designed to allow users of the firm's BrailleNote and
VoiceNote hardware to browse the web easily and navigate using
links to the Global Positioning System (GPS) network of
satellites.</p>
<p>There will also be a fresh batch of screen reader innovations on
show. Choice Technology (<a href=
"http://www.screenreader.co.uk">http://www.screenreader.co.uk</a>)
is previewing its DUAL screen reader, which can translate screen
content and keystrokes into voice output, while an enlarger program
magnifies selected portions of text (see also section five, this
issue). DUAL is designed to be affordable at 120 pounds and
flexible � voice and magnification can be selected independently
with a single keystroke. The company will also be demonstrating
WebbiE, an application developed at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology that converts content from web
pages into linear text.</p>
<p>Screen magnifiers get a useful set of new tweaks from Dolphin
Computer Access. The company (<a href=
"http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk">http://www.dolphinuk.co.uk</a>) has
developed a set of customisation tools which can render screen
colours in a mix chosen by the user and smooth magnified content,
so even highly magnified text retains its sharpness and
contrast.</p>
<p>Tactile interfaces will not be neglected. Duxbury Systems
(<a href=
"http://www.duxburysystems.com">http://www.duxburysystems.com</a>)
is flying over from the US to demonstrate DBT WIN 10.4, a product
that converts mathematical notations, expressions and graphs into
Braille output. Techno-Vision Systems (<a href=
"http://www.techno-vision.co.uk">http://www.techno-vision.co.uk</a>),
a UK-based distributor of Duxbury products, is to demonstrate a
Brailler that renders musical notation in UK standard formats. And
Cheshire-based specialist Zychem (<a href=
"http://www.zychem-ltd.co.uk">http://www.zychem-ltd.co.uk</a>) will
be demonstrating its latest tactile graphics products.</p>
<p>Optical devices will also be showcased, with Low Vision Supplies
(<a href=
"http://www.lowvisionsupplies.co.uk">http://www.lowvisionsupplies.co.uk</a>)
keen to demonstrate its range of telescopic and filtering lenses
for spectacles.</p>
<p>If visitors tire of investigating the products on show, they can
always turn their attention to an impressive range of new services.
The UK's Talking Newspapers Association (<a href=
"http://www.tnauk.org.uk">http://www.tnauk.org.uk</a>) is
particularly proud of its new Electronic Newsagent, which delivers
magazines on disk, by email, CD-ROM or over the internet. There
will be taped excerpts of 200 magazine titles available at the
show.</p>
<p>Getting to and from the venue and navigating around the
exhibition should be made easier by Describe Online, a provider of
online text guides for cities, stations and venues. Visitors to
Sight Village can find a practical demonstration of the service on
the Describe Online web site, which has a text guide to the
exhibition itself at <a href=
"http://www.describe-online.com/sight-village/textguide.htm">http://www.describe-online.com/sight-village/textguide.htm</a></p>
<p>Describe Online also provides text guides to parts of the
National Rail network � including the main Birmingham stations �
and the London Underground system (see E-Access Bulletin, February
2001).</p>

<p>Although many UK banks are currently relaunching their internet
services to improve accessibility (see E-Access Bulletin, June
2002), the accessible ATM (automatic teller machine) or �talking
cash point� has yet to appear in this country. Several other
countries however, including Australia, Canada and the US, are much
further ahead.</p>
<p>A talking ATM machine has a universal audio jack into which a
standard personal stereo type earphone can be inserted to allow the
user to listen to private instructions. The service talks the user
through all standard transactions such as cash withdrawal or
deposit, money transfer and checking an account balance. Visually
impaired people are expected to carry their own earphones, although
sometimes banks may keep some for general use.</p>
<p>In Australia, National Australia Bank is leading the way, with
the first audio-enabled ATMs in place and a pledge to make all new
machines audio-compatible from January 2003.</p>
<p>In the US, regulations set out under the Americans with
Disabilities Act have required that ATMs be independently usable by
people with visual impairments since 1992, and there are now over
3,000 talking cash points across the country, with commitments from
banks to install thousands more over the next few years.</p>
<p>And in Canada, the Royal Bank of Canada (<a href=
"http://www.royalbank.ca">http://www.royalbank.ca</a>) installed
its first audio ATM in October 1997 and has a total of 14 expanding
to 250 nationwide by September.</p>
<p>Kirk Reiser, who has been blind since the age of 11, is a
frequent user of RBC�s teller machines. He is also an experienced
user of all kinds of technology, being a network administrator at
the University of Western Ontario and the author of �Speakup�, the
leading screen reader for the Gnu/Linux operating system (<a href=
"http://www.linuxspeakup">http://www.linuxspeakup</a>. org).</p>
<p>Reiser says Royal Bank of Canada services do have good general
accessibility, including a Braille accounts billing system, but
there are occasional difficulties with the ATMs caused by the
smallest of changes.</p>
<p>�Most ATMs are slightly different from each other in the ways
they are laid out. So because I've sort of mastered one it leaves
me still unable to access others. Even the one I use changed it's
interface slightly recently which made me have to have someone go
over its options and menus again to learn to use its new
arrangement.</p>
<p>�They put in a new timed option to cancel or enter a new
transaction which left me thinking the machine wasn't working for
about two weeks because I was hitting cancel when I thought I was
entering end-of-transactions. It's really irritating because now I
have to count to five or six before pressing the button and if I'm
not right then I have to go through the entire operation again,
which doesn't make folks behind me in line very happy!</p>
<p>�Another frustrating thing about the new interface is that when
I do hit end-of-transactions it spits out my card, the receipt and
the money immediately and simultaneously making it difficult to
grab everything at once.�</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the UK, while no banks have yet introduced
accessible ATMs, almost all are investigating the options, not
least because in 2004, banks will have to comply with a new code of
practice under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) requiring
them to make �reasonable adjustments� to their premises to overcome
physical barriers to access.</p>
<p>The Centre for Accessible Environments (<a href=
"http://www.cae.org.uk">http://www.cae.org.uk</a>), a charity which
promotes discussion of accessible design issues, is currently
working closely with a number of banks and building societies on
accessibility of ATMs.</p>
<p>The centre has also published ATM guidelines which recommend
�more emphasis�.on tactile and audio feedback, speech output, the
avoidance of screen reflections, and innovative interface design
that makes less demand on visual capacity�.</p>
<p>Installing upgrades or new machines can be an expensive
business, however, according to Alan Looney, director of terminals
engineering at global ATM suppliers Diebold (<a href=
"http://www.diebold.com">http://www.diebold.com</a>).</p>
<p>�The premium for a new ATM to be capable of voice guidance is
typically hundreds of pounds, but the real cost is upgrading the
entire infrastructure that the ATMs are tied into,� Looney says.
�This typically costs in the tens or hundreds of thousands of
pounds to implement, depending on the age, complexity and size of
the network and its host system.�</p>
<p>Most of the large UK banking groups run networks of several
thousand ATMs, so the cost of full audio compliance will not be
trivial. But with the new DDA provisions looming the banks may have
little choice but to stump up.</p>

<p><strong>AFFORDABLE ACCESS.</strong><br />
by Roger Wilson-Hinds <a href=

<p>There are two dominant business models in operation in the field
of access technology: the pure business model and the charitable
model.</p>
<p>In the pure business model, talented and dedicated individuals
form a small company which generally uses borrowed cash to expand
their business to reach their scattered, minority client group.
There are several examples of technology resulting from this model,
including the well-known JAWS, HAL and Window Eyes screen readers.
On the surface at least, it seems to work well for everyone,
satisfying the needs of entrepreneur, investor and customer.</p>
<p>Only not everyone does actually benefit, because the high cost
of research and the need to reward investors for the high risks
they take result in a high price to the consumer. Prices are so
high in fact, that many cannot join in the game. Many visually
impaired people often find it hard to afford the price of computers
let alone the 600 pound price for software and 400 pounds a day for
training.</p>
<p>As a result, it is generally the same small group of employed,
funded or well-educated clients who receive the latest commercially
built screenreaders and the fastest PCs. Meanwhile the majority of
people who could benefit from screen readers - around 80 per cent
of visually impaired people - remain unable to afford these
systems.</p>
<p>So to the charitable model, built around the talent and
enterprise of major charities like the RNIB. This has brought many
useful products to the market, perhaps the best example being the
digital talking book project. In the case of access technology,
most of the large charitable organisations also provide the
necessary assessment, training and advice. Again it seems like
everyone's a winner.</p>
<p>But delivering major projects like talking books requires long
development periods and large capital outlay to employ a highly
skilled development team for a number of years. Again this system
does not benefit everyone, because charities like businesses are
forced to meet their costs. To do so they must focus their efforts
on serving initiatives of well-funded government departments or
large companies. Here again, it is those with low or no budgets who
often miss out.</p>
<p>Given the failings of both the pure business model and the
charitable model, the social business model offers the best way to
aid disadvantaged groups within society. Using this approach a
group of blind people decide what they want and enablers invest in
and develop the thoughts of the group. A social enterprise like
this is free from both the commands of government and the profit
motive.</p>
<p>Early ventures have mainly been centrally or regionally
organised for the benefit of the client group. But we are now
learning that the best results emerge when the model is focused on
a bottom up approach from within the community itself. This way
everyone feels ownership of the project and within the community
the necessary team talents can be encouraged by investment in
training.</p>
<p>We believe that by using this approach Choice Technologies'
LookOUT screenreader (<a href=
"http://www.screenreader.co.uk">http://www.screenreader.co.uk</a>)
can benefit even those on very low income. There are plenty of
obstacles in our way, not least the large group of developers,
assessors, trainers who make their living from selling or
supporting expensive commercial software. Nevertheless, we will
stick with the social enterprise model and keep selling our screen
reader at 80 pounds. Many in the blind community simply cannot
afford the alternatives.</p>
