NEWS.</a></h1>
<h1><a name="section-5." id="section-5.">* CONCERNS OVER NEW
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION BODY.</a></h1>
<p>Government plans to set up a single new anti-discrimination
commission, replacing three existing agencies, could make
disability laws more difficult to implement, the RNIB has
warned.</p>
<p>The scheme, announced to Parliament last month by Home Office
minister Barbara Roche (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/anti">http://fastlink.headstar.com/anti</a>),
proposes to replace the Equal Opportunities Commission, Commission
for Racial Equality and Disability Rights Commission with a single
body that would also cover discrimination on the grounds of age,
sexual orientation and religion.</p>
<p>However, the RNIB fears the new body would lack focus, which
could jeopardise the effective introduction of new laws covering
disability, with key parts of the Disability Discrimination Act and
the Special Educational Needs and Discrimination Act being phased
in over the next few years.</p>
<p>�It�s important that there�s a body focusing uniquely on
disability, providing advice and consultation to employers and
schools, for example, as each part of an act comes in,� Steve
Winyard of the RNIB told E-Access Bulletin this week.</p>
<p>The government aims to report findings this autumn, but
according to Roche, any major changes are unlikely in the
short-term. �I would not expect any new structures to be operative
in the lifetime of this Parliament,� she said.</p>
<h1><a name="section-6." id="section-6.">* UK LAUNCH FOR ACCESSIBLE
LAPTOP.</a></h1>
<p>LapTalk, a laptop computer with integrated screenreader designed
specifically for visually impaired users, is expected to launch in
the UK later this summer.</p>
<p>The product, developed by US company Beyond Sight (<a href=
"http://www.beyondsight.com">http://www.beyondsight.com</a>), will
be around the same size and weight as a conventional laptop
computer and has the Window-Eyes screenreader built in.</p>
<p>LapTalk will run the Windows XP operating system, provide
internet access through a built-in modem or network port, and offer
full versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser and
Outlook Express email software. Microsoft-compatible word
processor, spreadsheet and database applications are also
planned.</p>
<p>If it lives up to its maufacturer's claims, LapTalk could
replace the combination of note-taker and computer to which
visually impaired users have grown accustomed, at around half the
cost. Beyond Sight is also expected to launch DeskTalk, a desktop
version of the computer. Both machines will include a connector for
screens, allowing visually impaired users to share information with
sighted users.</p>
<h1><a name="section-7." id="section-7.">* EUROPE BACKS COMMON
DESIGN STANDARDS.</a></h1>
<p>European Union members will have to adopt common standards for
the design of public sector web sites by 2003, making them easy to
access by users with disabilities, under new laws set to be passed
by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The parliament debated a report yesterday on a common design
framework (<a href=
"http://fastlink.headstar.com/ep">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ep</a>)
that will eventually form the basis of a Council Resolution. The
resolution will also establish independent national bodies to
handle complaints about inaccessible web sites.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by the Parliament Industry Committee, also
reviewed the progress by member states in reaching accessibility
targets already laid out in the EU's 'eEurope 2002' information
society action plan. In particular, the committee recommended that
government, health and education web sites include speech
technologies that allow navigation by voice commands.</p>
<p>In addition, the report found that while all web sites use
standardsbased technologies like XML in their construction, they do
so in different ways, noting: �That is particularly problematic for
disabled with special navigation apparatus.�</p>
<p>Meanwhile the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(<a href="http://www.etsi.org">http://www.etsi.org</a>), has
released a first draft of a standard that will define computer
speech commands for all major European languages, making
multilingual speech recognition technology more viable for a wide
range of devices:<br />

<h1><a name="section-8." id="section-8.">* 'CYNTHIA' INTERPRETS THE
WEB.</a></h1>
<p>A web navigator with a built-in 'interpreter' that produces
voice descriptions of web content is being developed by Paris-based
technology company Daumas Informatique (<a href=
"http://www.daumasinformatique">http://www.daumasinformatique</a>.
fr).</p>
<p>'Cynthia' is designed to present web content to users in large,
bright, customisable text formats accompanied by descriptions in
English, French or German, in male or female voices.</p>
<p>According to its manufacturer, the technology can interpret
pictures where a web designer has included a description in HTML.
It is also designed to reveal some of the structure of a web site,
such as numbers of pages and links, and short descriptions of their
functions. Cynthia can also produce flexible voice responses, with
louder output indicating titles of documents and lower volumes for
body text, for example.</p>
<p>The browser's VoiceXML technology is designed to be compatible
with all Unix, Mac and PC operating systems.</p>
<p>Daumas has also produced a small handheld device with
Brailletagged keys, 'LISON', that speaks currency conversions to
and from the euro. For more information on both these projects

<h1><a name="section-9." id="section-9.">* TECHSHARE 2002 �
LEARNING AND WORK.</a></h1>
<p>Learning, work and the rise of a digital society are to be the
three key themes at this year's Techshare, the RNIB's annual
conference on technology for visually impaired people.</p>
<p>The event's organisers have issued a call for papers, and in the
learning category, are keen to cover e-learning, computer training
and regulation. The work theme covers procurement, standards,
training and ways of working, while digital society topics include
mobile phones, internet voting, digital television and e-books,
together with the perennial issue of web accessibility.</p>
<p>The conference will take place on 21-22 November at the
International Convention Centre, Birmingham. To submit a paper

<h1><a name="section-16." id="section-16.">* HOME ENTERTAINMENT:
Bulletin reader Paul Schomburg is</a></h1>
seeking information on accessibility of the new Multimedia Home
Platform interactive television standard (MHP - <a href=
"http://www.mhp.org">http://www.mhp.org</a>) developed by the
industry consortium Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB � <a href=

<p>He says: �As much interactive TV will be in a textual format
(including XML-based formats), I am looking for information on
accessibility tools for MHP development. If interactive TV is
launched without accessibility then many blind users will be unable
to participate.</p>
<p>�In the US recently the cable industry research consortium
CableLabs introduced a series of �OpenCable� specifications based
on MHP, but apparently without accessibility tools (see <a href=
"http://www.opencable.com/specifications.html">http://www.opencable.com/specifications.html</a>).
The OpenCable application platform specification OCAP 1.0 defines a

<h1><a name="section-17." id="section-17.">* ONE-WAY TRAFFIC: In
our last issue Larry Johnson from Texas</a></h1>
queried an apparent anomaly in the international library exchange
system whereby his regional library for the blind cannot borrow
from the UK National Library for the Blind, despite these resources
being listed in international catalogues.
<p>Mrs Chris McMillan, a regular correspondent of ours from the US,
confirms: �The answer Larry has been given is correct. The National
Library for the Blind has a system which gives Canada and the UK
readers access to both libraries but at present that�s as far as it
goes. I believe there are discussions under way with other English
speaking countries to extend this system though.</p>
<p>�I should point out that the National Library for the Blind in
the UK only deals with material in Braille. Anything to do with
audio would be a separate issue entirely. The RNIB supplies us with
both Braille and audio material.�</p>
<h1><a name="section-18." id="section-18.">* SHOP SMART: Several
readers sent in advice following last</a></h1>
month�s appeal from David Porter on behalf of a friend of his with
tunnel vision, for information on gadgets to help her avoid bumping
into people when shopping in a supermarket and also when swimming
in a pool.
<p>Chris McMillan says: �Over the years there have been electronic
warning or guidance devices, but they've been so expensive that
they've never caught on. I haven't heard of anything in the UK for
some years now.�</p>
<p>She also has visually impaired friends who swim and says they
either swim with sighted help or swim when �lanes� are in use.
�Growing up in a partially sighted school, we learned to swim
without bumping into each other, and some of my schoolmates have
gone on to become Olympic winners!�</p>
<p>Rod Carne, chief executive of the National Blind Children's
Society, also has low-tech advice: �I walk in front of the shopping
trolley and find this reduces accidents. If you are not hellbent on
being independent the stores usually fall over themselves to
provide an assistant to help you.</p>
<p>On swimming he says: �I crack this problem by using my local
pool when they have lane swimming. I can at most times locate the
black line on the bottom of the pool which fortunately is midway
between the barrier ropes. Prior to this they would always put in a
lane for me when it was not busy.</p>
<p>�I consider that you have a case for this sort of concession
under the Disability Discrimination Act. If you cannot get anywhere
with your local pool, try writing to the chief executive of the
local council, or I could try negotiating for you.�</p>
<p>Larry Johnson says: �To deal with the problem in the pool, she
might swim with a buddy along side to alert her about other
swimmers or obstacles. Another technique, one which I follow, is to
swim along the side of the pool touching it from time to time to
keep position. A third alternative is to choose to swim at a time
when there are fewer swimmers. None of these are perfect solutions,
but they work.�</p>

<li>TALKING NEWSPAPERS.</li>

<h1><a name="section-20." id="section-20.">* ALL THE NEWS THAT'S
FIT TO EMAIL.</a></h1>
by Phil Cain <a href=
"mailto:phil@headstar.com">phil@headstar.com</a>
<p>There are now many up to date news services available on the
internet, much of it accessible to visually impaired people.
Nevertheless, the bulk of the information appearing in the latest
newspapers and magazines in your local newsagent is still not
online.</p>
<p>Up until now this problem has been tackled by sighted people
volunteering to reading the publications onto tape � the �talking
newspaper�. From the beginnings of this work in the early 1970s the
UK has become home to the world's most extensive network of
volunteer newspaper readers, made up of some 520 local groups, 430
of which are affiliated to the Talking Newpaper Association UK
(TNAUK - <a href=
"http://www.tnauk.org.uk">http://www.tnauk.org.uk</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, the national network delivers around 1,100 of the UK's
1,500 local newspapers, to an audience of 200,000 visually impaired
people. TNAUK, based on a small industrial estate in Heathfield,
East Sussex, is also responsible for voicing the UK's national
newspapers and around 200 magazines and newsletters in its eight
on-site studios.</p>
<p>Though popular, the tape transcription method does have its
drawbacks. The biggest problem is that the process is extremely
labour intensive, with the Sunday Times alone taking around 30
hours to read from front to back. When this time is added to that
needed to copy and deliver the tapes, it means a timely service is
nigh-on impossible without cutting corners. And, when it comes to
factual information, there is a fine line between cutting corners
and censorship. In TNAUK chief executive Tim McDonald's point of
view, "There should be a right to access newspapers and books under
the Disability Discrimination Act."</p>
<p>Now however, new software tools and internet-based delivery
methods are revolutionising the service, so much so that is
sometimes now even faster than delivery of the paper version. Using
automated text editing machines and email delivery TNAUK now
delivers the complete text of newspapers to visually impaired
people hours before they arrive at the newsagents. On a good day,
TNAUK says a newspaper will be on the subscriber's electronic
doormat by 4.30am.</p>
<p>Publishers play their part in the digital supply chain by
sending the raw copy of their newspapers to the association in
Quark or PageMaker desktop publishing formats. To do so is an act
of trust, with publishers wary of piracy, but McDonald says they
can rest easy: "We will fight piracy as hard as anyone.�</p>
<p>TNAUK's electronic catalogue doesn't stop with the national
papers, offering subscribers around 200 other magazines and
newsletters electronically. According to TNAUK programmer Ian
McGregor, "These types of publications offer considerable
challenges in their �standard� form for visually impaired people.
They are difficult and often impossible to read, even with a strong
magnifier. The pages are often printed in many colours on glossy
paper, and text is sometimes superimposed over images."</p>
<p>Other tasks which need to be carried out before a publication
can be despatched include the substitution of contractions for full
words and linear text for tables, a particular favourite of
consumer titles like Computer Shopper. "The biggest difficulty we
have here is the rather slack standards of composition," says
McGregor. "A lot of people don't know the difference between 'soft'
carriage returns and 'hard' carriage returns. Nobody takes into
account what we have to do later on."</p>
<p>Despite its advantages, TNAUK�s digital subscription rates
remain low, with only 10 percent of the association�s 20,000 or so
subscribers choosing this format. TNAUK's head of IT Tony Dart
explains the low uptake on the fact that visually impaired people
tend to be older and so are less likely to be familiar with
computers.</p>
<p>For people who prefer the human voice, TNAUK is committed to
continuing with the tape format. But even this trusty format is due
to get a high tech facelift, with the studios due to digitise this
year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these high-tech developments for the visually
impaired could even come full circle and end up teaching the
sighted a thing or two. To Tim McDonald, email delivery is the
future of news for everybody, and the techniques being developed by
TNAUK could lead the way.</p>

REPORT</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>ACCESSIBLE BANKING (Part One).</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="section-22." id="section-22.">* USABILITY ON
TRIAL.</a></h1>
by Tamara Fletcher <a href=

<p>Online banking is often one of the first ways in which people
start to gain confidence in using the internet for everyday
transactions, but for those with visual impairment it has not been
so easy.</p>
<p>In September 2000, the RNIB tested the accessibility of web
sites of 17 well-known high street businesses, including four
banks: Abbey National, Alliance and Leicester, HSBC and NatWest. Of
these four, none passed all the basic tests set for them, and one
(who was generously allowed to remain anonymous) did not pass
any.</p>
<p>Last year even more extensive usability testing took place at
six banks and a follow-up report, 'Accessible e-banking', was
published in October 2001 by the RNIB with the British Banking
Association, ahead of a conference in April.</p>
<p>The conference heard of a situation which is fast improving, but
still with some way to go before internet banking becomes fully
accessible. Joe Norburn, head of the web team that runs Natwest.com
and its parent company's site Royal Bank of Scotland (<a href=
"http://www.rbs.co.uk">http://www.rbs.co.uk</a>), said he would not
consider using an agency that had could not understand how to make
web sites accessible, not least because of the obligations for
accessible digital services implied by the Disability
Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>He advised developers to incorporate accessibility from the
start of a project as it is more difficult to retrofit an existing
site and underlined the importance of user testing while addressing
the misconception that to make a web site accessible is to make the
user experience less compelling � saying that it is possible to
push the boundaries of design while still complying with
accessibility guidelines.</p>
<p>Abbey National recently relaunched its e-banking service
(<a href=
"http://www.abbeynational.co.uk/ebanking_home.htm">http://www.abbeynational.co.uk/ebanking_home.htm</a>)
and is currently working on a text only version of their site,
which may be available later this year. A spokesman for the bank
said: �RNIB had been quite verbal about our previous web site. At
the end of January we relaunched it and are committed to further
improvements. We sit in the office and use the Jaws browser with it
so we�re confident with it.�</p>
<p>Nationwide (<a href=
"http://www.nationwide.co.uk">http://www.nationwide.co.uk</a>) is
also making progress. One employee at the building society told
E-Access Bulletin: �We�re making our pages more accessible
generally. Parts of the site are already compliant, for example
banking, credit cards, investment and pensions, but the home page
is still very inaccessible � so the front door hasn�t been
addressed but the hallway has.�</p>
<p>The online banking parts of the site are due to be relaunched
soon, and the bank says during the development process of the new
site they have learned much more about accessibility issues and
will continue work to improve it.</p>
<p>One bank customer and experienced internet user who has been in
communication with the RNIB about accessibility problems is Ian
Dawson, who has been totally blind since 17, and has accounts with
Nationwide and NatWest. He says he lost his original registration
with the NatWest web site through problems logging on, and hasn�t
been able to reregister since.</p>
<p>�Each bank has different security processes - with Nationwide,
the log on process is relatively straightforward. You have a
customer number, choice of password and a pass number. With NatWest
there�s a random element to it � you have a user number uniquely
identifiable to you, then they ask for three letters from your
password. Using a screen-reader, you have a limited time to do this
but it also depends much on which screen-reader you use.�</p>
<p>The RNIB/British Banking Association report highlights a series
of other key features of accessible banking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make logging in straightforward - make login link one of the
first to be accessed within the tab order. When login process has a
number of stages, use the word �continue� rather than �send� or
�confirm�. Make sure user is made aware of any new browser
windows.</li>
<li>Keep it simple - terminology should be unambiguous. Provide a
link to a list of abbreviations, if used. Error messages should be
concise and give the user an indication of what to do next.</li>
<li>Use tables correctly and consider how they might be read.</li>
<li>Provide help and clear messages on screen and ensure that
navigation round the site is reasonable - forms can be particularly
confusing at first as the whole page is not visible.</li>
<li>Lay out statements clearly - make sure credit and debit amounts
are easily distinguishable.</li>
<li>Keep users informed when logging out, and provide a link to log
back in.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Next month we look at the accessibility of ATM cash
machines. 'Accessible e-banking' is available from the BBA in
print, audio and Braille formats for 80 pounds - email <a href=

METAL BOX.</a></h1>
By John Wilson <a href=
"mailto:jwjw@onetel.net.uk">jwjw@onetel.net.uk</a>
<p>I have been using computers for over ten years now, but I well
remember some of the frustrations and seeming impossibilities I
faced when I first started. Nevertheless, having grasped the
essentials of using keyboard shortcuts, screenreaders and Braille
displays, a blind person can quite rapidly turn a frustrating metal
box into a very helpful and life-enriching aid and companion.</p>
<p>There are special programs written for blind people designed to
be easy to use from the keyboard only. But the reality is that,
both at home and at work, visually impaired people need to learn to
use the same programs as their sighted counterparts. For visually
impaired people this means learning to use keyboard shortcuts.
There can be considerable differences between programs in how
easily this can be done, with some having few or no 'hot keys'. But
the main problem for visually impaired people is often obtaining
meaningful feedback to check you have achieved your goal, not using
the keyboard or remembering the hot keys.</p>
<p>Fortunately most Windows-based programs come with a enough
keyboard shortcuts and a good screenreader will let you know if you
have succeeded. But still, for the beginner, learning how to use
some of these massive programs - such as the MS Word processor, the
Sound Forge audio system, or Nero-Burner CD copying software - can
be a daunting prospect.</p>
<p>This is where good quality training or good text and tape
tutorials tailored specifically to the needs of visually impaired
users is crucial. With the best will in the world, a sighted
trainer of sighted people using sighted methods often cannot grasp
how a blind person must use alternative methods to achieving their
goal and verify the results.</p>
<p>I remember the difficulties I had years ago learning to use the
DOS DataEase database manager with a sighted trainer alongside
sighted colleagues. One problem the trainer had no answer for was
the difficulty I had reading the tables the program produced. Once
halfway down a page, the table's contents disassociated from their
heading. I later discovered that DataEase reports can be created in
a variety of formats, including one in line by line format, which
meant reading and understanding the report file was much easier
than in columns.</p>
<p>When using mainstream software such as Microsoft Word, Excel,
WordPerfect, TextBridge Millennium, Sound Forge or the main web
browsers, it is more important to learn the general shortcut
keystrokes and hot keys embedded in Windows programs than learn the
hot keys of your screenreader.</p>
<p>By becoming dependent on the special keystrokes of a particular
screenreader, you could find yourself unable to operate a machine
with a different screenreader on it. For example shortcuts such as
Control + O to open a file, Control + P to print, Windows key + M
to go to the desktop, Tab and Shift + Tab to move through web page
elements, will work on most Microsoft software and packages
following Windows conventions.</p>
<p>This said, it is useful to learn the keystroke shortcuts built
into their screenreader where Windows does not have equivalents.
For example, with the Window Eyes screenreader, Insert + S reveals
the System Tray; with the JAWS screenreader, Shift + Insert + Down
arrow tells you what has been highlighted; and with HAL, Control +
9 switches between column-reading and line-reading modes.</p>
<p>I would recommend the use of a modern Windows-based computer,
together with a printer and print scanner, with a speech, Braille
or magnification system, to anyone who has a need to read their own
literature and a desire to be as independent as possible. They must
be aware though, before they buy a computer, that it will require a
considerable investment of their time and effort to become
proficient, but the results will be well worthwhile.</p>
