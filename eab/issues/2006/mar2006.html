<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i75-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Government Funding Gap Halts Progress On Accessible Books.</h3>
<p> 
 A project to make it easier for publishers to produce books in
 accessible formats has stalled because the government cannot agree
 which of its departments should provide the 200,000 pounds needed to
 kick-start it, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The pilot project, devised a year ago, would see the RNIB work with
 the Publishers Association, the Publishers Licensing Society and
 publishers Harper Collins, Blackwell and Palgrave Macmillan to
 develop digital templates for books in the universal XML structure that
 could then be published in accessible formats such as Braille, large
 print, and synthetic audio in parallel with print production.
</p>
<p> 
 The proposal followed last year's Right To Read campaign, which saw
 a petition of 32,000 signatures handed in to Number 10 Downing
 Street requesting government funding for more accessible books.
 According to RNIB estimates, some 96 per cent of all books published
 are never made available in large print, Braille, or audio.
</p>
<p> 
 "We had a letter from Tony Blair expressing support," RNIB
 campaigns officer David Mann told E-Access Bulletin. "Since then
 there's been further correspondence with the Prime Minister's office,
 but somehow these letters avoid the issue of funding. They list other
 things that the government is doing, some of which is irrelevant to this
 project."
</p>
<p> 
 The lack of funding may be due to the fact that the project doesn't fit
 neatly into any single department's territory, Mann said. "The Minister
 for Disabled People [Ann McGuire at the Department for Work and
 Pensions] has no money, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
 is responsible for libraries but not publishing, while the Department of
 Trade and Industry (DTI) is responsible for technology innovation," he
 said. "We had a meeting at the DTI with a working group and they
 wanted to go ahead, but when we got to the next step - government
 funding - we were stymied," said Mann.
</p>
<p> 
 This year's follow-up Right to Read campaign saw the launch of the
 Chapter and Verse initiative, which encourages authors to request a
 clause in their publishing contracts which will make their books
 accessible to blind and partially sighted people at the same time as they
 are published in standard print. Jacqueline Wilson, author of the
 popular "Tracy Beaker" books for children, is the first author to ask her
 publishers to add this clause to her contract.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Less Than One In 100 Uk Councils Hits Web Accessibility Goal.</h3>
<p> 
 Just three UK council web sites out of a total of 468 have reached basic
 accessibility levels as required by government policy, according to a
 report published this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's 'Priority outcomes' policy
 says local authority web sites must conform with 'AA' level of
 international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php</a>
), by 1 April 2006.
</p>
<p> 
 But the new annual 'Better connected' survey of UK council sites, from
 the Society of IT Management (Socitm -
 <a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk">http://www.socitm.gov.uk</a>
), found just three councils have achieved this level -  Clackmannanshire
 in Scotland, Kensington and Chelsea in London and Thurrock in
 Essex. The survey also found no improvement on conformance with
 the most basic accessibility level, Level 'A', compared with last year's
 report. Just 62 councils (13 per cent) achieved level A conformance,
 the same number as last year.
</p>
<p> 
 The report also finds a "disturbing picture" in the area of claims about
 accessibility made by council web sites. In a sub-sample of 296 sites
 examined, some 65 were found to make some kind of claim about
 accessibility levels, but of these just 10 were found to be justified, E-
 Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility was assessed by Socitm with the Royal National Institute
 for the Blind. For a full report on the survey see Section Three, this
 issue.
</p>
<h3 id="i75-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: New Draft Access Standards Unveiled For All Technologies.</h3>
<p> 
 Two new sets of official guidelines on access to technology - a draft
 British Standard and an international standard - were released last
 week.
</p>
<p> 
 The draft British Standard is a set of guidelines aimed at web site
 commissioners setting out general principles of good accessible web
 design and clarifying steps needed to ensure sites are easy for disabled
 people to use.
</p>
<p> 
 While not a complete British standard, PAS 78, a Publicly Available
 Specification from the British Standards Institution,
 ( <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/PSS/Services/PAS.xalter">http://www.bsi-global.com/PSS/Services/PAS.xalter</a>
 ) will be reviewed every two years and could become a full British
 standard. It was compiled for the institution by the Disability Rights
 Commission.
</p>
<p> 
 PAS 78 recommendations include disabled people are involved in the
 site design process and organisations develop a web site accessibility
 policy. It endorses global benchmark the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines from the World Wide Web Consortium and is available for
 purchase from BSI priced 30 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, a draft of an international standard aimed at developers
 and designers of hardware such as printers and laptops as well as
 software, has been published for public comment. The draft from the
 International Standard Organisation (ISO) is entitled 'Accessibility
 guidelines for information communication equipment and services'
 (ISO 9241 -
 <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/iso2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/iso2</a>
 ). It includes general guidelines for making software and hardware
 accessible to all users, including a recommendation that all technology
 interfaces allow for assistive technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The standard's steering group is made up of industry representatives
 from over 24 countries and the public is invited to comment on the
 standard via the British Standards Institute (BSI) web site
 (<a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/">http://www.bsi-global.com/</a>
 ). The final draft will be made available from the national standards bodies of participating countries later this
 year.
</p>
<h3 id="i75-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Audible Navigational Devices Go Live In Birmingham</h3>
<p> 
 Pedestrians in Birmingham city centre will soon have access to a
 loudspeaker system that announces information about their location
 and how to find places of interest such as travel services, shopping
 areas and public buildings. The Wayfinder service
 ( <a href="http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wayfinder.bcc">http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wayfinder.bcc</a>
 ), planned for launch in May this year, will feature 60 loudspeaker units
 dotted around the city centre in the largest UK deployment of 'React
 Unit' technology developed by the RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 Users access the service through a credit card-sized device that can be
 clipped to a belt, but also works when carried in a pocket or bag. When
 the wireless-enabled card comes within a few metres of loudspeaker
 units mounted on street furniture, a voice message is automatically
 triggered.
</p>
<p> 
 The messages, designed with help from a vision-impaired user group,
 provide guidance on orientation as a well as information about location
 and directions, said project manager Julie Moss of Birmingham City
 Council. "It could be 'If there's traffic on your left, and a slope ahead
 of you, then New Street Station is on your right'," she told E-Access
 Bulletin. The user group, which included members of Birmingham
 Focus on Blindness
 ( <a href="http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk/">http://www.birminghamfocus.org.uk/</a>
 ) also helped select the most suitable locations for the loudspeakers.
</p>
<p> 
 The two-year Wayfinder project, which has cost the council 165,000
 pounds so far, will eventually be expanded by a further 60 units
 making 120 in all, although their exact locations have yet to be
 decided. The service will also be expanded to include languages that
 reflect Birmingham's diverse ethnic make-up, with services in Punjabi,
 Bengali, and Gujarati high on the list of candidates.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Moss, when the service goes multilingual users will be
 issued with a card that triggers messages in their languages alone.
 Cards will be priced at around 25 pounds each, and are powered by
 batteries that last around two years, she said. Similar services operating
 on a smaller scale are available in York and Leeds.

<p>  Fay Rohrlach from South Australia writes in response to the feature "A Brighter Future" (E-Access Bulletin,
 February 2006) which mentioned the high price of assistive devices for
 blind and vision impaired people. "It's high time that we as blind and
 vision-impaired people started to speak out on these issues," says Fay.
 "It is all very well for those privileged few who have plenty of money,
 but for those who have to work, save, skimp, and scrape for big
 amounts, it is another story.

<p> 
 "I had to get myself an Easy Reader, a device which, when plugged

 "It's time that manufacturers everywhere started to remove

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Opinion- Accessible Multimedia Production.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: The Only Game In Townby Kevin Carey.
</h3>
<p> 
 In his 1980 predictive commentary on the technological revolution
 'The Third Wave', a lesser-known but in many ways more richly
 suggestive book than his previous work 'Future Shock', the US
 sociologist Alvin Toffler described an information age where the
 boundaries would blur between producers and consumers.
</p>
<p> 
 Toffler has already been proved right on many points: email, mobile
 phones, digital photography, personal web sites and weblogs are all
 now commonplace methods that ordinary people and organisations use
 to create as well as consume content; but the most spectacular change
 has been in the cost of making and the method of disseminating what
 we used to call broadcast material. Two-thirds of us have multi channel
 television but with greater bandwidth we will soon be enjoying high-
 definition television on our PCs and quite acceptable quality television
 on our mobile phones and it will be sent out over the internet rather
 than using scarce broadcast spectrum.
</p>
<p> 
 Behind Toffler's prescient analysis there was a deep point: in an
 information society you can only live and work as a fully functioning
 member of society if you produce as well as consume: if you are, in his
 word, a prosumer.
</p>
<p> 
 The problem for the visual impairment community is that for the past
 decade or so it has been pretty well exclusively tied up with
 accessibility as it affects information consumption. Given the
 scandalous lag over easing copyright restrictions to allow access to
 digital materials, the snail's pace of the Web Accessibility Initiative
 and the pass-the-parcel over digital television access, such a
 concentration of technical and campaigning effort is not surprising; but
 it is time to move on, even if there are some pretty long loose ends in
 the areas I have just listed.
</p>
<p> 
 If acquiring the tools to produce content takes as long as to develop
 those to access and process content, then we had better start now. This
 is a hugely complex issue as it involves multimedia (for television or
 video on demand), radio, web development and blogging as well as
 acceptable document preparation.
</p>
<p> 
 First, the move from broadcasting over spectrum to publishing over the
 internet will provide massive scope for self expression and
 entrepreneurial flair; there is a very clear market for people who can
 take masses of disparate information and boil it down to essentials.
 When people say they are suffering from "information overload," what
 they really mean is that they are suffering from information evaluation
 deficit.
</p>
<p> 
 Second, the cost of producing multimedia is falling through the floor:
 cameras, editing equipment and transmission are getting cheaper every
 day. The difference between this and the radio market is that
 production values need to be high and there is no good economic
 model for local television; but it is bound to happen.
</p>
<p> 
 Third, blind and severely visually impaired people will need to learn
 how to collaborate in multimedia content creation, although I see no
 signs of this happening. This is particularly important where sound and
 images need to be fused.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, there is a special issue around the way in which our vision-
 impaired children are educated.
</p>
<p> 
 This is a daunting agenda because learning how to make things is
 almost invariably more difficult than learning how to consume things -
 it's easier to read a novel than write one, listen to Eric Clapton than
 play the guitar, access a web site than build one - but if we want to
 increase the number of vision-impaired people in work and decrease
 the number who are socially isolated, then this is the only game in
 town.
</p>
<p> 
 What we need is a combination of 'political' will from government,
 pump-priming cash from RNIB, broad minded academic researchers
 and a response from the hardware, software and creative industries.
 That is asking for an unprecedented degree of collaboration, but all
 four sectors are crucial to the success of the venture.

</h3>
<p> 
 The recently published annual review of the UK's local authority web
 sites by the local government Society of IT Management (Socitm -
 <a href="http://www.socitm.gov.uk">http://www.socitm.gov.uk</a>
 ) has found no improvement on basic accessibility since last year's
 report was drawn up.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Better Connected' report found just 62 out of a total of 468
 council sites meet basic web accessibility requirements, exactly the
 same number as last year.
</p>
<p> 
 "We know councils can do it, but they're not sustaining the effort,"
 said Socitm Insight programme manager Martin Greenwood.
</p>
<p> 
 To compound this disappointing finding, the study found just three out
 of all the sites reviewed - less than one in 100 councils - reached level
 'AA' of international accessibility benchmarks the Web Content
 Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php</a>
) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Clackmannanshire in
 Scotland, Kensington and Chelsea in London and Thurrock in Essex.
</p>
<p> 
 And this despite the fact level 'AA' is required of all English councils
 by 1 April 2006 to comply with the Office of the Deputy Prime
 Minister's 'Priority outcomes'
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/od4">http://fastlink.headstar.com/od4</a>
 ), a set of 73 best practice targets to use technology to improve public
 service delivery.
</p>
<p> 
 "Most of it isn't complicated; it's pretty well known what they should
 be doing," Greenwood said. "People are not doing enough to make
 web sites accessible to a large minority of people whose lives could be
 transformed if designers took advantage of the technology,"
</p>
<p> 
 On a more positive note, even though just three sites reached 'AA', the
 number is an improvement on last year's findings when no local
 authority site reached that level.
</p>
<p> 
 The report team annually tests every local authority site, thoroughly
 analysing content for features such as quality of search functions and
 how well the site links with other public services, availability of
 discussion forum, usability and ease of navigation as well as
 accessibility. Results were collated by a combination of automated
 testing tools and manual testing conducted by RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 For the first time, the Better Connected team investigated claims of
 accessibility made by council web sites - in other words, what people
 claim by displaying logos, as opposed to what the site's accessibility
 actually turns out to be through objective testing - finding a "disturbing
 picture." In a sub-sample of 296 sites examined, some 65 made a claim
 about accessibility levels but just 10 of these were found to be justified,
 Greenwood told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "This means either people were doing it deliberately - and I don't think
 people are - or it indicates they once reached [the standard specified]
 and have slipped back," Greenwood said. "Many people are lulled into
 thinking passing the automated tests . . . means you have achieved
 conformance at those levels," the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 Other research new to the survey this year includes an analysis of the
 use by councils of interactive online mapping and Geographic
 Information Systems, a notoriously inaccessible technology.
</p>
<p> 
 "If you're cutting off your web site to a significant minority you're
 losing the possibility of making efficiency gains. If you're making
 money out of a web site, you're losing potential customers - the same
 applies to local government," Greenwood said.
