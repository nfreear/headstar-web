<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Special Notice: GIS In the Public Sector- An EGB Seminar, 8 March 2006
- Places Limited, Sign Up Today
- Royal Institute of British Architects, London.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 Accessibility will be among topics to be discussed at E-Government
 Bulletin's second annual Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
 conference.
</p>
<p> 
 A huge proportion of public sector service data includes an address or
 location element, and electronic mapping underpins many modern web
 and intranet services. The event will cover what technologies are out
 there, how they could improve services and how they could save your
 organisation money.
</p>
<p> 
 Places cost 295 pounds plus VAT for public sector and 395 for private
 sector delegates, with additional delegates booking at the same time
 receiving a 100 pounds discount. Places are limited, so sign up today
 for the public sector GIS event of the year. For more information see:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i74-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Stand-Alone Device To Access Audio Content Over The Web.</h3>
<p> 
 A stand-alone device that provides access to selected news and
 entertainment audio web content without the need for high IT skills is
 planned for a launch later this year by a UK-based assistive technology
 charity.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'SpeakOn', developed by a-technic
 (<a href="http://www.a-technic.net">http://www.a-technic.net</a>
 ), will be about the size of a digital TV set-top box, and plug in to a
 phone socket to play its output through any standard speaker, TV or hi-
 fi. It will use software developed by a-technic trustee Professor Isaac
 Porat from the University of Manchester to present choices of content
 and download it automatically from the internet.
</p>
<p> 
 Content offered will include DAISY-formatted books, MP3 music
 files, internet radio stations, podcasts and other web site content
 including online newspapers. Users will not need to access web sites
 directly, making the system well-suited for vision-impaired users
 without high IT skills.
</p>
<p> 
 "You won't realise you're going to a web site," said A-Technic
 founder and chairman Chris Mairs. "If you select the Guardian web
 site, under the covers [content] is whizzed off the internet but users
 won't know that."
</p>
<p> 
 The device will be operated by a simple keypad similar to that of a
 phone. Four raised navigation buttons arranged around a moveable nob
 will allow users to scroll and select their choice, for example tracks
 from a music playlist or articles from an online newspaper.
 Subscription deals are still being sought for music download and audio
 newspaper content, but once there are in place the device will be
 released at a price of no more than 500 pounds, Mairs said.
</p>
<h3 id="i74-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Talking Cash Machines Live Following Successful Trials.</h3>
<p> 
 Yorkshire Bank is the first English bank to introduce talking cash
 machines to its branches, following successful trials of the technology.
 The new machines will be phased in as older equipment is replaced.
</p>
<p> 
 The bank has deployed a talking cashpoint at its new flagship branch in
 Albion Street, Leeds, following trials at two other branches in Leeds
 and Hull in July 2005 and trials in Belfast, Northern Ireland and
 Glasgow, Scotland at sister banks the Northern Bank and Clydesdale
 Bank respectively. More branches are expected to follow, according to
 a Yorkshire Bank spokesperson.
</p>
<p> 
 Talking ATMs (automated teller machines) enable vision-impaired
 customers to hear details of their accounts and transactions spoken
 through a standard set of headphones when plugged into a socket on
 the front of the machine. To ensure privacy, customers are given the
 option of switching off the visual screen while carrying out
 transactions.
</p>
<p> 
 For more on previous trials see 'Talking Cashpoint Machines in Small-
 Scale European Tests', E-Access Bulletin July 2005.
</p>
<h3 id="i74-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Inaccessible Web Sites 'Could Lose Billions'.</h3>
<p> 
 Web site owners stand to lose billions of pounds worth of business if
 they fail to tackle basic accessibility problems, according to research
 from technology access charity AbilityNet
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ability1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ability1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The charity surveyed the internet habits of 100 people with disabilities
 including vision impairment, and found that they tended to go to
 mainstream web sites for information, shopping, banking and leisure
 rather than to web sites specifically focused on their disability. The top
 ten most popular web destinations cited were the BBC, Nationwide
 building society, Google, eBay, Amazon, the Guardian and Times
 newspapers, Lastminute.com, Premierleague.com and Yahoo.
</p>
<p> 
 A major factor in these choices is greater accessibility of these web
 sites compared with their rivals, said the report. The survey found that
 many web sites are inaccessible due to basic design flaws. Typically,
 the size of text cannot be adjusted, images are not labelled properly,
 and animations are used extensively
</p>
<p> 
 Web site owners who are complacent about these issues risk losing
 valuable business to their rivals, according to the report's author Robin
 Christopherson. "These potential internet users represent a spending
 power in excess of 120 billion pounds. The arguments are compelling.
 Whether from a moral, legislative or commercial perspective, suppliers
 of goods, services and information on the internet are ignoring a highly
 significant market sector at their peril," he said.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Blind Computer Trainer Named Volunteer Of The Year.</h3>
<p> 
 A blind volunteer from Somerset in the UK has won a prestigious
 national award for his work training vision impaired people to use
 computers, assistive technology and other electronic devices.
</p>
<p> 
 David Godly, who is a committee member for the charity Woodspring
 Association for Blind People (WABP -
 <a href="http://www.wabp.org.uk/">http://www.wabp.org.uk/</a>
 ) in Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset, was one of just five volunteers
 selected from more than 2,000 volunteer nominees to receive an award,
 winning in the 'Inspiration' category.
</p>
<p> 
 Godly has spent the last four years providing home training for vision-
 impaired people, many of whom are older or isolated, to help them to
 install and use specialist technology including screen readers, screen
 magnifiers and adapted keyboards.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'm very concerned about blind people who don't go to work and
 can't afford these machines," Godly told E-Access Bulletin. "I'm
 trying to solve this in my own way." As part of his mission, Godly
 began a scheme whereby he takes second-hand computers, installs free
 demonstration versions of assistive technology software such as JAWS
 on them and provides them to vision impaired people in the community
 for free.
</p>
<p> 
 The awards mark the end of the Volunteer of the Year
 ( <a href="http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org">http://www.yearofthevolunteer.org</a>
 ) initiative, which recognised the work of volunteers across England in
 2005 and was led by Community Service Volunteers, the Volunteering
 England Consortium and funded by the Home Office.

<h3 id="i74-05"><b class="Ps">+</b>05: Raised Standards:</h3>
<p>  A code of practice on web accessibility is to be published on 8 March by the British Standards Institution. The
 'Publicly available specification' (PAS) was commissioned by the
 Disability Rights Commission and is aimed at web site commissioners
 and developers. 'PAS 78 - Guide to good practice in commissioning

<h3 id="i74-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Copyright Conundrum:</h3>
<p>  Tony Dart, Chief Executive of online library The Seeing Ear,
 ( www.seeingear.org )
 writes in response to Rakesh Chand from Fiji, who wrote in the last
 issue to request the library be opened up to vision-impaired people
 outside the EU.
</p>
<p> 
 "I have had the unenviable task of having to refuse access to a number
 of people who need this service, because they are outside this
 geographical boundary," Tony writes. "The reason is simple. I have a
 licence to publish copyrighted material issued by the UK Copyright
 Licensing Agency and this forbids me to offer this service outside the
 EU, even in the US where many of the books are published!
</p>
<p> 
 "That is the bad news. There is, however, something that anyone who
 wants to see the online library in their own country can do. They can
 write to me with details of the copyright law in their country, or where
 I can obtain these details. Obviously, I am only interested in the law
 that applies to vision impaired people and how they can obtain books! I
 will try my very best to ensure that every print-disabled person can
 enjoy access to what they want to read, when they want to read it."

<p>  Ibrahim Gucukoglu writes in response to Stephanie Read's request for accessibility advice on her new mobile phone, the
 Orange SPV C550 powered by Windows. "To obtain the most
 accessible software for mobile phones," writes Ibrahim, "the mobile
 needs to run the Symbian operating system
 ( <a href="http://www.symbian.com">http://www.symbian.com</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 [Accessible mobile phone software] TALKS, a popular screen reading
 application will allow access to virtually all elements on the mobile
 screen including battery status and signal icons, date and time as well
 as other more useful functions including text messaging, email and
 WAP access. Another application is Mobile Accessibility which as
 well as providing speech, provides an excellent magnification
 application to enlarge characters on the screen. As I have not used this
 product myself, I can not vouch for its suitability but I am reliably
 informed that it is a good alternative to TALKS as it is aimed at the
 novice to intermediate user. I know of no product that works on
 Windows-powered mobiles with the exception of Pocket PCs, but that
 is an entirely different ball game."

<p>  Roger Petersen, a member of the Information Access Committee of the American Council of the Blind writes: "We are
 interested in improving the access for blind people in the US to
 television, including navigation of set-top boxes, TiVos [the digital
 video recorder] and all sorts of digital TV devices and systems. We

<p>  A reader writes to ask about sources for job listings for assistive technologists: "I am an access technology
 specialist in California looking for any resources for employment for
 access technology specialists, such as job-opening lists, for anywhere
 in Europe, Canada or the US. I have searched but have been unable to
 find any such resources, other than an odd job here and there on
 Monster.com or newspaper classified ads. I was hoping that [readers]

 ideas you might have would be greatly appreciated."

<h3 id="i74-12"><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Poor Reception:</h3>
<p>  Giovanni Urso from Naples in Italy writes on the accessibility of two-way radios and receiving devices. "The world of
 radio amateurs and listeners has always been crowded with blind
 people, who carry out this hobby with the utmost passion and devotion.
 Unfortunately their commitment is not always reciprocated by the
 manufacturers, who have rarely paid attention to the accessibility
 issues of sight-impaired people.
</p>
<p> 
 "With the exception of Kenwood and a few other manufacturers, who
 created voice-based software for reading the frequency when the two-
 way radio is being tuned, and apart from the introduction of an
 automated tuner allowing the amateur to reach any frequency without
 damaging his or her radio, almost nothing has been done in this field.
 As a result, it grows more and more difficult to cultivate this
 interesting hobby. Many highly-developed devices appear every day on
 the market, full of every kind of menu, but they are almost off-limits
 for a blind person. Therefore, I believe it is high time to raise our
 voices, so that the most important manufacturers of these devices pay
 more attention to this range of customers, who are surely not few. I
 hope you will welcome my appeal."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Focus- Podcasting.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: The Future Is Pod-Shapedby Carli Hawes.
</h3>
<p> 
 'Podcasting' has taken little over a year to become the newest internet
 revolution. But while the technology may be just entertaining and fun
 for most computer users, for blind and visually impaired people
 podcasting could be the most important innovation in communication
 technology since the invention of screen readers.
</p>
<p> 
 'Podcast' was a term coined in 2004 when the technology allowing
 audio content to be broadcast online, received and stored on mobile
 devices and computers became commercially popular. The word is
 derived from a conflation of 'iPod' (the popular MP3 music file player
 from Apple) with 'broadcast'. However, you do not need an iPod to
 listen to podcasts, nor is the content broadcast in the traditional sense
 of the word, which would only allow users to listen to one source at a
 time at a predetermined time.
</p>
<p> 
 In fact, your podcast receiver software or 'podcatcher' allows you to
 'subscribe' to as many audio programs as you want, which will be
 downloaded automatically for you to listen to whenever and wherever
 you want.
</p>
<p> 
 The software needed to download and play podcasts varies in its
 accessibility to blind computer users. iTunes, the software application
 from Apple, is hard to navigate, so despite being a free application
 blind computers users have to purchase a 30 pound piece of additional
 software available from T and T Consultancy Ltd
 (<a href="http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html">http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html</a>
) to translate the system into a series of easy to remember keystrokes.
</p>
<p> 
 There are a few podcatching systems that have been built specifically
 for the blind. In the UK Alasdair King has developed a piece of
 accessible software called WebbIE which allows blind users to
 download and listen to podcasts or the radio by incorporating their own
 screen reader or other access solution. "Web pages are often hard to
 navigate for visually impaired people. WebbIE podcatcher software is
 much more accessible," said King, "Podcasting is an infant technology
 - as yet there is no Google directory equivalent, there is no way to
 make it simpler in the mass market."
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile in the US Dr Susan Gerhart is working with a team of
 students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona
 to produce a podcatcher fully accessible for blind people called
 <a href="mailto:@Podder">@Podder</a>
 ( <a href="http://www.apodder.org/">http://www.apodder.org/</a>
 ). Gerhart's team is also compiling an extensive library of podcasts
 relating to sight problems and the vision-impaired community. "Since
 podcasting is only a year old, collectively we should be able to put a
 well-organised library of audio information drawn from podcasts into
 the hands of many who need the information and appreciate having a
 community of similarly interested people," Gerhart says.
</p>
<p> 
 The huge new demand for podcasts has already resulted in an
 abundance of variety shows, news bulletins, comedy shows, religious
 sermons and political statements being produced every day.
</p>
<p> 
 The Daily Telegraph newspaper launched a daily news podcast in
 December 2005. It currently offers extracts totalling around 20 to 30
 minutes in duration. "We don't have plans to read out the whole
 newspaper, it would take about eight hours and be very hard to
 navigate," the Telegraph's podcast editor Guy Ruddle told E-Access
 Bulletin. However the newspaper is eager to improve its services for
 people with disabilities and has a meeting planned with the RNIB later
 this month to discuss possible improvements to their current audio
 service, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 As podcasting technology develops, people are finding more and more
 inventive ways of using it. One eBay seller, Mark O'Neill, has added a
 podcast link to a selection of his eBay auctions to try and encourage
 blind computer users to venture onto the site and force the site's
 developers to improve accessibility. "Many people who surf eBay may
 have problems with their eyesight. Wouldn't they instead appreciate an
 audio description of your item, instead of struggling to read your
 auction text?" O'Neill said.
</p>
<p> 
 Producing your own podcast is not as complicated as you might think;
 the requirements are a high quality microphone and a good
 understanding of the podcast software you are using. Recording and
 producing podcasts is a great opportunity for blind people to get their
 voices heard, says Nick Apostolidis, a blind computer user and
 technical adviser to E-Access Bulletin. "Podcasting is a lot like being a
 journalist, you have to do research, find an audience and build a
 reputation." The technology can support online communities of blind
 people who can communicate with each other about all manner of
 issues, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The continued rise of podcasting can only be good news for blind and
 visually impaired people. And with whispers that ITV is going to start
 producing audio-only versions of popular TV shows such as the Bill
 and Coronation Street, the future is looking promising.

<p> 
 "There are two common themes in developing specialist technology,"
 Chris Mairs told listeners at the annual Turing lecture hosted this
 month by the Institute of Electrical Engineers and the British Computer
 Society. "Access for people with a disability will lag behind the
 mainstream population and secondly, such technology is often
 commercially unviable."

 But Mairs is not easily deterred: he is co-founder of a
 telecommunications company, Data Connection; founder of assistive
 technology charity a-technic and winner of the world waterskiing
 championships with the assistance of the Bat Blaster, a device he
 developed and now sells through the charity.
</p>
<p> 
 The lack of viability of most assistive products is highlighted by the
 costly and slow development period of the Bat Blaster, and the fact few
 are manufactured, Mairs said. This results in an expensive product that
 only the privileged few can afford, a situation all too familiar in the
 specialist technology sector.
</p>
<p> 
 This model for manufacturing assistive technology will not be
 sustainable, he said. "If we have to build specialist technology we
 won't reach the 2025 objective," Mairs said. The objective was
 contained in last year's 2005 Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report,
 "Increasing the life choices of disabled people"
 ( <a href="http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/disability/">http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/disability/</a>
 ), which said: "by 2025, disabled people in Britain should have full
 opportunities and choices to improve their quality of life and will be
 . . . included as equal members of society."
</p>
<p> 
 The only way this target will ever be hit will be to build in accessibility
 from the start, Mairs said. "Disability is very diverse. Building in
 accessibility from day one is practical for all disabilities."
</p>
<p> 
 But the need for technology providers to provide new functionality and
 new trends may be preventing them from incorporating accessibility
 from the outset. "Manufacturers are reluctant to remove the 'sizzle' to
 increase accessibility," Mairs said.
</p>
<p> 
 Many people with a disability are caught between a rock and a hard
 place when trying to access computers, mobile phones and other
 electronic devices. "Either they can't use them at all or they have to
 use a specialist device, most of which are prohibitively expensive," he
 said. Often, it is digital interfaces that make them inaccessible.
 "Devices often exclude people that can't use those interfaces."
</p>
<p> 
 To compound the problem, digital interfaces - an on-screen menu for
 example - have become cheaper to manufacture than traditional
 button-based designs, Mairs said.
</p>
<p> 
 With so many obstacles to accessibility, one wonders where
 manufacturers wanting to reach wider markets should begin. But
 according to Mairs, two simple tenets should steer manufacturers in the
 right direction: "You need appropriate interfaces between function and
 content and you need affordable technology," he said.
 In the meantime, Mairs is working on removing other obstacles - the
 obstacles to making effective text-to-speech, particularly on the web.
 Any aspect of, say, a web page of no consequence to the vision
 impaired user should not be read aloud. "Audio [output] shouldn't have
 the clutter associated with a visual interface," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Mairs and his team are currently developing 'SpeakOn'
 ( <a href="http://www.a-technic.net/speakon.htm">http://www.a-technic.net/speakon.htm</a>
 ), a low cost computer that aims to solve this conundrum. Designed to
 deliver only audible content such as podcasts; simplified web pages
 and electronic books, it will be released later this year (see lead news
 story, this issue).
</p>
<p> 
 While the picture Mairs paints of the current accessibility scene is far
 from rosy, the future as he sees it is set to be brighter. "The explosion
 of digital technology can provide enormous gains by creating specialist
 devices," he told the audience. "The ever-reducing cost of resources,
 the continuing trend of open multi-modal interfaces (presenting
 information in more than one way) and improving legislation," he said,
 are all leading to improved accessibility across the board.
</p>
<p> 
 "I believe we are at the watershed of opportunity to affect this 'random
 walk' with technology," he said.
