<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Sponsored Notice: BT's BSL Guide- Improving Communication for All.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 To celebrate the third anniversary of British Sign Language (BSL) BT
 launched the first ever campaign in BSL to raise awareness of the
 benefits broadband technology has to offer to deaf people, the first
 time an internet communications organisation has run a commercial
 internet campaign in sign language.
</p>
<p> 
 High speed internet coupled with the use of web-cams and video
 streaming allows BSL users to communicate via the internet and break
 down geographical barriers.

<h3 id="i81-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Rnib Addresses Software Accessibility Gap</h3>
<p> 
 The RNIB has launched an online resource of advice and information,
 the first stage in a wider initiative to raise awareness of accessibility
 issues for software generally, rather than just the technology used for
 websites.
</p>
<p> 
 Aimed at web designers and developers, systems integrators,
 purchasing professionals and policymakers, the 'Software access
 centre'
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib7">http://fastlink.headstar.com/rnib7</a>
 ) provides information and advice on testing and evaluating software for
 accessibility, procuring software and information on the relevant
 legislation in the UK and Europe.
</p>
<p> 
 The site will expand to include more examples of good software design
 and purchasing, tools and techniques including company case studies.
 The team behind the site also plans to introduce a software
 accessibility audit service and training courses.
</p>
<p> 
 "We needed to get some information and resources into the public
 domain," Senior ICT Development Officer and site author Ruth Loebl
 told E-Access Bulletin. She said there is already a glut of resources on
 web accessibility proved by the high hit rate of RNIB's 'Web access
 centre' on which the resource was based. "Access barriers in software
 are just as high," Loebl said.
</p>
<p> 
 The resource was launched in response to an assumption the word
 "accessibility" stands for 'web accessibility according to Loebl. "Web
 accessibility is generally easier and quicker to fix than software
 accessibility because software renewal cycles are in the range of five to
 10 years compared with website renewal which is more like five to 10
 months," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 The software centre includes the RNIB's top five recommendations for
 ensuring software is accessible including: 'get to know the standards
 and guidelines' and 'try to carry out every task and action without
 having to use a mouse.'
</p>
<h3 id="i81-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Win For Campaigners In Massachusetts</h3>
<p> 
 Anti-discrimination campaigners in Massachusetts have won important
 concessions that will ensure electronic documents published by the
 State government are accessible to users of screen reader technology.
</p>
<p> 
 Campaigners attacked government plans to switch its electronic
 publishing from proprietary software such as the Microsoft Office
 suite, to software based on the Open Document Format
 ( ODF - <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/odf">http://fastlink.headstar.com/odf</a>
 ), the first State in the Union to do so. See E-Access Bulletin Issue 73,
 January 2006 for more details.
</p>
<p> 
 Campaigners protested that many screen readers are built to work with
 Microsoft products rather than those based on open source software.
 The move, originally intended for 80,000 desktops by January 2007,
 has been replaced by a plan that will see official documents published
 in both formats.
</p>
<p> 
 Beginning in January 2007 the State government will deploy plug-in
 software for its Microsoft products that will enable documents to be
 saved in ODF as an option. According to the State, the Massachusetts
 Office on Disability will be among the first wave of government
 agencies to deploy the plug-in, and the migration is set to be complete
 by June 2007.
</p>
<p> 
 However, an official statement from the government suggests that this
 is seen as a transition arrangement, and that regular reviews will be
 made of the software market for products that comply with ODF and
 are accessible
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass3</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The Information Technology Division of the State government did not
 respond to requests for further details from E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 id="i81-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Councils To Launch Talkative Robots</h3>
<p> 
 By next summer, residents of Camden in London will access
 information about local services by phoning a council number and
 holding a normal conversation with interactive voice software, instead
 of using a phone keypad to navigate through menus, or waiting for an
 operator to respond.
</p>
<p> 
 Users can ask questions as if they were speaking to a human operator,
 and receive a natural-sounding spoken response. "It should be able to
 handle quite general queries like 'What's on tonight in Camden?'" said
 Alasdair Mangham, Camden Council's Head of Business Systems and
 IT. "It would probably respond with a question like 'Are you interested
 in cinema or theatre..?' and so on," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Mangham, such a system is well-suited to local
 authorities because of the large number of services they deliver.
 "Councils deliver around 500 services. You can't have 500 options
 available through menus and key presses, there's a lot to gain from
 having an interactive voice technology like this," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The system, put together from a mixture of existing technologies and
 bespoke components by councils in Camden, Barcelona and Turin
 ( <a href="http://www.bcn.es/hops/">http://www.bcn.es/hops/</a>
 ), also has the potential to respond automatically to a caller in a range of
 languages. So far it has been tested in Catalan, Spanish, Italian, and
 English, on two types of service: a guide to local events and
 entertainment and a service for removing large items such as unwanted
 furniture.
</p>
<p> 
 The next step will be to invite between 60 and 100 Camden residents to
 test the service, probably in late October or early November. "We hope
 to have a prototype built by the end of December, and to launch the
 service in Camden around April next year," said Mangham.

<h3 id="i81-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Path Cleared For Wearable Navigational Device</h3>
<p> 
 Research on a wearable device that provides a detailed "audio map" of
 a user's environment, enabling navigation around small obstacles in
 the street and through buildings, has been boosted by 600,000 dollars
 funding from the US National Science Foundation.
</p>
<p> 
 The System for Wearable Audio Navigation (SWAN), developed by
 the Georgia Institute of Technology
 ( <a href="http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/research/swan/index.html">http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/research/swan/index.html</a>
 ), provides audio "beacons" to help direct the user. As the user nears a
 destination their tempo increases until a chime sounds to indicate
 arrival. "Consider a ring around your head, about a meter away, at eye
 level," assistant professor in Georgia Tech's School of Psychology and
 College of Computing Bruce Walker. "Sounds seem to be located at
 any point on the circumference of the ring."
</p>
<p> 
 While other navigational devices for vision impaired people have been
 developed, few allow for indoor navigation. But the development team
 are to improve the indoors navigation capability of the device
 following the funding award.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, the system consists of a backpack holding a laptop
 computer, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and other sensors, a
 digital compass, a tracking chip, a head tracker, four cameras, a light
 sensor and bone-conduction headphones, which convert electric signals
 into vibrations, sending sound to the internal ear through the cranial
 bones thus allowing other sounds to permeate.
</p>
<p> 
 Work is also underway on reducing the size of the device. "We are
 relying on more wireless and bluetooth, to eliminate wires and cables,"
 Walker said. "The dream is to make the cameras embedded in a
 headband," said assistant professor in the Georgia Tech College of
 Computing Frank Dellaert.
</p>
<p> 
 The project team will shortly begin usability testing of the device with
 sighted and blind participants. In future there are also plans to use the
 built-in camera for facial recognition to speak the name of the person
 to the user.

 The fact is that although we are living in the third world by the

 don't think that anyone in these countries is using those programmes
 you have mentioned in your mail. I have seen that even in England, the
 adaptive technology is so expensive that an ordinary person can't
 afford to buy it. The need now is to urge governments to take steps to
 bring down the prices of these things and to force the manufacturers to
 sell them on a no-profit basis. In my opinion, the price hike of adaptive
 technology amounts to inaccessibility.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Lessons Learned In Strathclyde And Malawiby Derek Parkinson
</h3>
<p> 
 As the start of the new academic year approaches, university
 departments are gearing up for the new intake of students, but for Carol
 Murphy, an Assistive Technology Adviser at the University of
 Strathclyde, this summer has been busier than most.
</p>
<p> 
 This year, Murphy has been involved in the early stages of setting up a
 project to improve the accessibility of learning materials for vision
 impaired students at schools and universities in the African republic of
 Malawi.
</p>
<p> 
 Supported by 180,000 pounds from the Scottish Executive
 International Development Fund, the 'Making Wonders' project has
 supplied laptops, assistive technology such as screen readers and
 magnifiers, training and support to three schools and one teacher
 training centre in the African country
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/strath1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/strath1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 This first phase of the three-year project involved laying the
 foundations, installing products such as the Freedom Scientific JAWS
 screen reader and the Zoomtext magnifier from AI Squared on
 computers, and training teachers in Malawi to use them effectively.
 "The training began with switching on the computer," says Murphy.
 "We taught them to touch-type without looking at a monitor,
 sometimes using headphones and sometimes with blindfolds," she
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 The teachers were also taught about how the operating systems worked
 using Sarah Morley's book 'Windows XP Explained'
 ( <a href="http://www.winguide.co.uk/">http://www.winguide.co.uk/</a>
 ), says Murphy. Over the next two years, Murphy and her colleagues will
 deliver further support for Malawi's teachers as they take their newly
 acquired skills into the classroom, providing educational opportunities
 that weren't available before. "Examination papers are available in
 Braille, but not course materials," says Murphy. Although the
 government of Malawi has little funding available to spend on
 technology, it is committed to helping support the training of teachers,
 she says.
</p>
<p> 
  Although there may not be obvious similarities between the education
 systems of the UK and Malawi, Murphy says that her experiences in
 Africa will certainly benefit her work in Strathclyde. "I've hardly had a
 chance to take my notes out of my case and look at them, but they're
 so comprehensive they will certainly be useful here," she says.
</p>
<p> 
 At Strathclyde, Murphy's work involves liaising with assistive
 technology developers and the IT department to ensure that the
 University's JAWS and Zoomtext equipment is up-to-date and the
 licences paid for, helping students use the equipment, and flagging up
 problems with the accessibility of coursework to academic staff.
 "Generally they're very good and try to help," she says. "There was
 one course that involved heavy use of websites, and some were very
 difficult to use with screen readers. The problems were fixed within
 days," says Murphy.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, other issues can take longer, she says. Overall, Murphy
 says that Strathclyde's IT staff, lecturers, and library staff are generally
 very supportive of her team's efforts. But the process of assessing a
 student, applying for funding, setting up equipment and training can
 take months. This can mean that most of the first term has gone before
 a new student has their assistive technology needs sorted out.
</p>
<p> 
 Strathclyde has found ways of minimising the worst effects, says
 Murphy. "We can loan students equipment until the funding is sorted
 out," she says. With 10 years work experience in this area, Murphy is
 well-placed to spot shifts in attitudes in the education sector.
 "Legislation has helped to focus people's minds," she says. "One of the
 changes is that dealing with disability is increasingly seen as
 everyone's responsibility, not just disability advisors."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Opinion- Personal computing
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: All Change!By Kevin Carey
</h3>
<p> 
 There is no doubt that, in terms of access technology, I am one of the
 elite: I am a self-employed consultant with a well appointed office
 where my Index Braille embosser is attached to my PA's computer. I
 work on a [HumanWare] BrailleNote qwerty version and tend to
 transfer all my messy files to my PA for editing and routing. The
 equipment was initially supplied through the Department for Work and
 Pensions's Access to Work (ATW) programme. It's a fine life.
</p>
<p> 
 Except that, in the past two years, since I acquired the new embosser
 neither the software it came with nor the software I used before work
 properly. I have had to settle for a situation where every apostrophe
 and single quote comes out as 'ae' (which makes reading awkward as
 these letters contract with contiguous characters); and I have to put up
 with huge slabs of Braille because the translator can't handle hard or
 soft line breaks. My BrailleNote is wonderful, as are the people who
 support it, but it hasn't worked properly for the past two years; and, as I
 write, I have been waiting for a new one for four weeks. I will have to
 buy this as ATW says the 'Friday afternoon' model that I've got is
 repairable; well, so is a vintage car!
</p>
<p> 
 In the past 10 years my whole system has never gone for more than
 four months without a fault. I gave up trying to use standard systems
 with bolt-on accessibility because the incompatibility disputes never
 got solved; but the turnkey solutions are provided by companies that
 are too fragile. Incidentally, I have never been able to work out how
 you stop the Braille display cursor in either kind of system defaulting
 to the extreme right or disappearing onto the invisible next line; this
 started when I moved from WordStar to Word on a bolt-on system and
 persists in the BrailleNote.
</p>
<p> 
 All in all then, with my sound basic knowledge of the technology, my
 accessibility life is quite difficult; so what must it be like for people
 who are unfamiliar with technology and find it hard to pick up the
 phone and get some service? And as the kit originally came from
 ATW, what about people who are not working?
</p>
<p> 
 I think it is time that we had a total change. Starting with the ATW
 programme, but expanding to all vision impaired people, there should
 be a legislated right to access information based not on grants for
 purchases of hardware and client side software, but on financial
 support for hardware leasing and a subscription-based server side
 service providing applications and storage.
</p>
<p> 
 Of course this will only work with broadband and flexibility will
 require that to be delivered by wireless, for example. But as the policy
 will take years to implement there is no need for my elite peers to
 worry about whether they will be able to pick up their emails on Mount
 Snowdon at three in the morning. Clearly a broadband, server side
 service will not be totally ubiquitous but anyone who wants something
 better should pay for it.
</p>
<p> 
 What I am proposing would spare us all the problems of
 incompatibility and the wretched upgrade. It would allow us to use
 much thinner clients with much less complicated technology and this
 would facilitate a much faster turnaround of faulty kit.
</p>
<p> 
 Obviously there will have to be a joint agreement between the
 Government and organisations like the RNIB and perhaps even the
 accessibility industry, as long as it does not try to preserve the status
 quo. The cartel of companies that run global accessibility have had
 their chance and failed; it's time to face the broadband future with a
 more viable accessibility package.
