<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Fans Will Lose Out, World Cup Web Sites Review Finds.</h3>
<p> 
 Official web sites for the 2006 World Cup are so poorly designed that
 most vision impaired fans won’t be able to use them to buy tickets for
 matches or souvenirs, and will have difficulty finding even basic
 information like match results, according to accessibility consultants
 AbilityNet.
</p>
<p> 
 The World Cup web sites for England’s Football Association (FA –
 <a href="http://www.TheFA.com/WorldCup2006">http://www.TheFA.com/WorldCup2006</a>
 ) and the competition’s governing body F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de
 Football Association (FIFA –
 <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/</a>
 ) were found to fail even the most basic accessibility requirements, the
 study found. On a five-point scale, where three indicates a base level of
 accessibility, the FIFA and FA web sites were rated one and two
 respectively, leaving both organisations at risk under anti-
 discrimination law, said AbilityNet.
</p>
<p> 
 The results are particularly disappointing given the landmark legal case
 over the 2000 Sydney Olympics, when sports fan Bruce Maguire won
 a legal case against the organisers because their web site was
 inaccessible, said AbilityNet’s Head of Web Services Robin
 Christopherson. “It really shows the lack of progress they have made
 over the last six years,” he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The web sites were evaluated using automated checkers and human
 testers for compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
 ) the internationally recognised standard drawn up by the World Wide
 Web Consortium
 ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Both web sites suffered problems with their display, structure and
 navigation, making even the most basic services unavailable to even
 experienced web surfers, according to AbilityNet. “Many areas of
 FIFA’s site were difficult or impossible to use and, despite my best
 efforts, I was unable to buy a ticket…I think I'll follow the Cup on the
 radio,” said one.
</p>
<p> 
 Typical problems included failing to enable text to be resized or the
 colours of displays adjusted, poor labelling of images, use of
 inaccessible Flash animations at key points, embedding pop-ups in
 pages with no warning, and extensive use of JavaScript, which is
 inaccessible to users of older browsers. Both sites failed to adequately
 cater for people who rely on keystrokes rather than a mouse for
 navigation.
</p>
<p> 
 Although the FA web site was more accessible than that of FIFA, some
 accessibility features like audio news reports were spoilt because they
 weren’t well signposted, and could easily be missed, according to
 AbilityNet. “I’ll do what I did last time, and follow it on the BBC web
 site,” said Christopherson.
</p>
<p> 
 “We have made a number of changes to the site already to ensure
 accessibility but we are aware there is still more to be done and these
 have been incorporated into the overall review of our web site which is
 taking place at present. We do appreciate hearing from any user who
 has a specific issue with the web site,” an FA spokesperson told E-
 Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The World Cup study is one of several ‘State of the eNation’ reports
 looking at web accessibility across a range of sectors. For more details,
 see the ‘News and Events’ section of AbilityNet’s web site:

</p>
<h3 id="i78-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessible Automatic Tellers To Be Deployed Across Italy.</h3>
<p> 
 Accessible Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) aimed at vision
 impaired users are being deployed across Italy.
</p>
<p> 
 Around 400 ATMs have already been installed across the country at
 Poste Italiane
 ( <a href="http://www.poste.it/en/">http://www.poste.it/en/</a>
 ) post offices, with a further 600 to be installed by October. The ATMs
 will allow vision impaired people to withdraw money independently
 and, for the first time in Italy, enable payment of council tax and
 speeding fines and allow pensions to be collected, among others.
</p>
<p> 
 Vision impaired users plug their own headphones into a socket located
 on the ‘Personas M series’ machine to receive all on-screen content as
 audio output to guide them through cash withdrawals and bill
 payments. The screens automatically blacken while a transaction is
 underway to ensure privacy.
</p>
<p> 
 Additionally, the machines’ ‘number five’ key has a raised profile to
 assist orientation when typing in number sequences such as pin codes
 and the function keys have tactile markers. There is also strong
 contrast between the written text and the screen background for low
 vision users.
</p>
<p> 
 Following a trial last year, machines using Braille were scrapped after
 it emerged only a small percentage of vision impaired people can read
 Braille, due to the fact the majority acquire blindness later in life.
</p>
<p> 
 The new dual purpose machines, which look like regular ATMs, aim to
 cut queues in post offices and increase efficiency as part of a wider
 modernisation of the Italian postal service.
</p>
<p> 
 The new machines have been developed by global technology
 company NCR, who are working in collaboration with Italian postal
 service Poste Italiane
 ( <a href="http://www.poste.it/en/">http://www.poste.it/en/</a>
 ) and national blindness organisation Unione Italiana Ciechi
 (<a href="http://www.uiciechi.it/vecchio/ibu.html">http://www.uiciechi.it/vecchio/ibu.html</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i78-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Resource For Accessible Media Players Launched.</h3>
<p> 
 Vision impaired people wanting to know more about the accessibility
 issues to take into account when using portable media players such as
 Apple’s iPod have a new online resource with the launch of the
 Portable Media Player Portal
 <a href="http://www.hartgen.org/portable.html">http://www.hartgen.org/portable.html</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 The web site gives an overview of issues such as the cost, functions,
 and accessibility for mass-market media players like Apple’s iPod
 family and the iriver products from Korea as well as those purpose-
 built for vision impaired users, such as the BookPort and BookCourier
 products.
</p>
<p> 
 “Products designed for the seeing market can be accessible because
 there are products available that make them talk. The specialist
 products have the advantage of being designed for vision impaired
 people but they have the drawback of high price and limited storage
 capacity,” Brian Hartgen, technical consultant at T and T Consultancy
 told E-Access Bulletin. Typically, specialist products provide four
 gigabytes of storage compared with the 40 or 60 gigabytes available
 with mass-market products, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Hartgen, interest in portable media players has grown
 rapidly in recent months, but many people want guidance on what is
 available. “The bottom line is that if you want a player with large
 storage, that handles a variety of formats and is fully accessible, there’s
 nothing currently available,” he said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, the accessibility of the iTunes software has been improved
 for users of Jaws screen readers with the launch of new scripts from T
 and T Consultancy, enabling easier navigation around the iTunes
 system, said Hartgen
 <a href="http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html">http://www.tandt-consultancy.com/itunesscripts.html</a>
 .</p>
<h3 id="i78-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: First Online Multiplay Board Game Released.</h3>
<p> 
 The world’s first accessible multiplay board game has been released
 and is available for free online.
</p>
<p> 
 The game can be played online by up to five gamers who play the
 entire game using sound alone. For those playing the offline version of
 the game, the computer imitates co-players.
</p>
<p> 
 Developer Igor Khmelevtsov describes the game, Lords of the Galaxy,
 as “an economic strategy game like Monopoly.” Players are given a
 space ship in which they move between planets which, among other
 assets, are bought and sold while battling against meteorites and galaxy
 monsters. Players can buy weapons to defend themselves from
 enemies. The goal is to become Lord of the galaxy by accruing more
 money then other players.
</p>
<p> 
 “I’ve found a couple of accessible online card games for blind and
 visually impaired people,” said Khmelevtsov. “I have [developed]
 three online accessible games two gamers can play [but] I haven’t
 found any accessible online board games for [several] gamers.”
</p>
<p> 
 Lords of the Galaxy is available from Igor and Alina Khmelevtsov’s
 accessible gaming web site VIP Games Zone
 ( <a href="http://www.vipgameszone.com/">http://www.vipgameszone.com/</a>
 ), which has previously released online educational games for vision-
 impaired school children in the Ukraine and beyond. All VIP Games
 Zone games are free and can be played without special software.

<p>  Asim Rauf from Pakistan continues the debate on the high cost of technology: “The problem with visually impaired
 people living in the third world is that we don't have access to modern
 technology because of its cost. When we convert the currency into our
 own, then it goes beyond reach, or even beyond thinking. There is an
 [imperative] need for the world to put its efforts together to improve
 the standard of living of people with visual impairment in third world

Section Three: Opinion
–  Procurement

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: In Search Of The Holy Grailby Kevin Carey
</h3>
<p> 
 I am writing this piece from the Royal Geographical Society, London.
 The LBS4all project
 ( <a href="http://www.lbs4all.org/">http://www.lbs4all.org/</a>
 ) – which aims to develop a personal navigation aid for people who
 experience difficulties travelling on foot – is holding a user day for
 location-based services.
</p>
<p> 
 In prototype, this allows vision impaired people using a personal
 digital assistant (PDA) and screen reader software from Dolphin
 Computer Access Pocket Hal, to undertake independent navigation
 with a stream of local information received on the web from adapted
 Ordnance Survey digital maps.
</p>
<p> 
 Whether or not this will be overtaken by standard satellite navigation
 systems, built for cars but adapted for foot travel, is a really interesting
</p>
<p> 
 question.
</p>
<p> 
 But the “Holy Grail” is a blind person arriving in a strange town
 enabled to find any building she wants on foot (using, of course, a
 mobility aid if necessary).
</p>
<p> 
 Ah, the Holy Grail! I have been in accessibility now for more than a
 decade and am just a little weary of holy grails: a fully usable word
 processor; a bug-free Braille translator with an intelligent approach to
 layout; across-the-board web accessibility based on statute and
 regulation; a fully accessible mobile phone; full electronic programme
 guides (EPGs) and audio description for digital TV; an upgrade that
 upgrades. I have said before – and it is sad that this still holds true –
 the
 only fully accessible digital products that I own are my kitchen scales
 and microwave!
</p>
<p> 
 What are we to do about these frustrated ambitions? The key point is
 that the sector must stop worrying about technology; it should, simply,
 stop doing any speculative or loss-making research. Agencies like the
 RNIB and a host of niche developers have struggled and only the
 RNIB and a handful of commercial developers are still in the access
 technology business. Selling ambition and aspiration has proved to be
 of very limited use. There has been far too much concentration on the
 question: "Can you do it?" rather than on the questions: "How badly do
 you want it and how much of it do you want?"  
</p>
<p> 
 In other words, instead of starting with technological research we
 should start with generic user requirement research and meet the needs
 of procurers. If we push for accessibility to be a user requirement in
 public sector services, public utilities, financial services, retail,
 broadcasting and telecommunications, consumer electronics, housing
 design and leisure (and that lot accounts for the vast majority of all
 digital transactions) you can be sure that there will be funding to
 realise the requirement.
</p>
<p> 
 Forget the technology and think about services. You want to talk to the
 Government, shop effectively, use a cash point, locate an entry phone,
 weigh self service potatoes, cross the road safely, send a message and,
 I suppose, pay your bills.
</p>
<p> 
 So lay off the Microsofts of this world; they only supply the providers
 of goods and services. If the procurement criteria change to include
 more accessibility than they currently supply, they will supply it.
</p>
<p> 
 In some instances the precise opposite applies; software companies are
 providing accessibility that suppliers are ignoring. We should never
 forget the farce of the audio described programmes waiting for a set
 top box to decode them.
</p>
<p> 
 In summary, we need to turn the whole, traditional sequence on its
 head. Techies working on flimsy budgets with miniscule markets (with
 the exception of the Department for Work and Pensions’ Access To
 Work items –
 <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/HelpForDisabledPeo">http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/JCP/Customers/HelpForDisabledPeo</a>

 have largely failed. Even the few remaining major players provide
 scandalously expensive and unreliable solutions. The sector should
 concentrate on campaigning for generic, platform neutral, user
 requirements-based accessibility and should then make a respectable
 profit meetineg the need.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Seminar report – Seminar Report– Location-Based Services
</h2>

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Carving A Path For Navigational Aidsby Mel Poluck
</h3>
<p> 
 Navigational devices installed with location-based services enable
 vision impaired people to independently plan journeys and find routes
 on foot or by public transport. But many such services or devices are
 yet to reach the vision-impaired community.
</p>
<p> 
 Some local communities or authorities, for example, have installed
 units mounted at bus stops or lampposts providing location-related data
 activated by wireless fobs. And portable devices on the market
 specifically designed for vision-impaired users, such as the BrailleNote
 and Trekker both from Humanware
 ( <a href="http://www.pulsedata.com/products/Notetakers/BrailleNoteGPS.asp">http://www.pulsedata.com/products/Notetakers/BrailleNoteGPS.asp</a>
 ) are wonderful devices but are unaffordable to the majority of people
 who need them.
</p>
<p> 
 Both products are enabled by Global Positioning System (GPS). And
 with this technology, along with General Packet Radio Service
 (GPRS), wireless and bluetooth available even on everyday devices
 such as mobile phones, the potential for location-based services or
 navigational aids is broadening. “All big companies are engaging in the
 delivery of location-based information to the consumer: Google,
 Yahoo, Microsoft. . . ,” Professor Mike Jackson of University of
 Nottingham told the audience of a seminar on location-based services
 for people with disabilities in London last month, hosted by
 PhoneAbility, the UK arm of European organisation COST 219ter
 ( <a href="http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/">http://www.tiresias.org/cost219ter/</a>
 ) which aims to ensure next generation services and terminals are
 accessible to all. “The intellectual and technological challenge we have
 today is with multiple streams of data which could communicate with
 each other to build up rich, timely data,” Jackson said.
</p>
<p> 
 Nevertheless, research and development on navigational aids for the
 mobility-impaired is blossoming around the globe. Later this year, for
 example, user groups with disabilities will test a navigational device in
 the Swedish cities of Stockholm, Malmo and Gotheberg. The trials are
 part of a research study  
 ( <a href="http://www.pts.se">http://www.pts.se</a>
 ) from the Swedish National Post and Telecom Agency, led by the
 Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, the Swedish Handicap Institute
 and government and industry bodies, Dr Jan-Ingvar Lindstr&#246;m told
 delegates. The pilot device provides audio mapping data to users via
 bluetooth, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and GPS
 technologies and will link users to a contact centre with staff via the
 mobile phone network to assist users requiring additional help. In
 future there are plans to introduce a facility enabling users to add their
 own data about the environment or points of interest as they encounter
 them.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, in Atlanta, US, the Wireless Rehabilitation Engineering
 and Research Centre (Wireless RERC-
 <a href="http://www.wirelessrerc.gatech.edu/">http://www.wirelessrerc.gatech.edu/</a>
 ), which promotes universal access to wireless technologies, is working
 on developing a location-based service prototype. “We encourage the
 industry to realise not all users of technology are 20 year olds with
 nimble fingers,” said Dr John Peifer, WRERC co-director.
</p>
<p> 
 Their Mobile Accessibility Guide (MAG –
 <a href="http://www.wirerc.org">http://www.wirerc.org</a>
 ) aims to provide tailored data to meet individuals’ transport and route
 planning preferences. The device’s memory contains location-related
 data gathered from various sources, including the local council and
 accessibility guides to public spaces. It provides information such as
 whether entrances have ramps or stairs – and if so how many – and
 doorway width for wheelchair users, among others. Users can choose
 to receive audio information about their environments and can receive
 updated alerts on recent, undocumented news such as broken lifts in
 buildings. MAG even allows its users to become “mobile reporters,”
 recording changes to locations and objects in the environment while on
 the move.
</p>
<p> 
 But in trials, this particular feature was unsuccessful. “People won’t
 spend time recording changes in the environment if they have to spend
 a long time doing it,” he said. “We need to research how long people
 are willing to spend on it.” Other aspects of MAG were found to need
 further development too. “The initial prototype was expensive and
 complex. The hardware was too clunky, interfaces were too complex,”
 Peifer also said volunteers needed more training on how to use the
 device.
</p>
<p> 
 Another MAG prototype is under development and the team are
 looking to incorporate geographical information service ‘Google
 maps,’ from software giant Google, to include markers highlighting
 accessibility of information, such as Braille menus, or buildings.
</p>
<p> 
 With the European Commission project, ‘Ambient Intelligence System
 of Agents for Knowledge-based and Integrated Services for Mobility
 Impaired users (ASK-IT –
 <a href="http://www.ask-it.org/">http://www.ask-it.org/</a>
 ) developing a navigational system which will next year be tested in
 eight European cities, and with further technological developments in
 the pipeline, the future of navigational services looks promising.
 Mobile phones will pick up voice over IP (VoIP) over wi-fi networks,
 allowing cheap or free calls and the possibility for data relevant to the
 user’s location to be streamed direct to devices in wireless “hotspots.”
 Additionally, more satellite launches are planned, adding to the
 multitude of location-related data sent to the planet.
</p>
<p> 
 But there is a way to go before devices are readily available on the
 market and problems do remain, such as users of GPS-enabled devices
 losing signal when they enter “urban canyons,” say, between tower
 blocks or when they are inside buildings.
</p>
<p> 
 But as University of Nottingham’s Mike Jackson said, the key
 challenge now is to unite multiple data streams to ultimately provide
 portable, refreshable, interactive and information-rich navigational
 devices which could improve the daily lives of vision-impaired people
 in extremely important ways: by boosting confidence in mobility,
 increasing independence and providing the chance for spontaneity.
