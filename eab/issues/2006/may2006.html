<h3 id="i77-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: User Experience Core To Updated Web Accessibility Guidelines.</h3>
<p> 
 A more structured approach to user experience, based around precise
 tests that help translate user feedback into accessible web design, is at
 the centre of new guidelines being drawn up by the Web Accessibility
 Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium
 ( WAI - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The updated Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
 ( WCAG 2.0 - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20.php">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag20.php</a>
 ) will lay out a practical approach for including feedback from users,
 giving web designers clearer guidance on improving accessibility
 during the design process, E-Access Bulletin has learned. "The
 normative portion of WCAG 2.0 is the 'success criteria'. The success  
 criteria are designed to be precisely testable, while the checkpoints in
 WCAG 1.0 were not," Judy Brewer, director of the Web Accessibility
 Initiative told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The checkpoints in WCAG 1.0 make design recommendations, such as
 "Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner", but they don't
 provide much detailed help for designers needing to assess the results
 of implementing these recommendations. "We are developing tests for
 the implementation techniques associated with WCAG 2.0 success
 criteria. Our goal is to enable more reliable assessment of conformance
 to WCAG 2.0," she said. The only test procedures laid down in WCAG
 1.0 are for automated checking tools, rather than human users.
</p>
<p> 
 The new guidelines also have a much wider scope than those they
 replace, according to Brewer. "Given the rapid and continuing
 evolution of web technologies, the WAI felt it would be most valuable
 to develop a guideline for web content accessibility that could apply
 across all web technologies," she said. "The Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines 1.0 had focused mainly on HTML, as do many other
 locally-developed web accessibility guidelines," she explained.
</p>
<p> 
 The first version of the standard, WCAG 1.0, was released in 1999, so
 updated guidelines are needed to make sure that work on accessibility
 keeps pace with innovations in technology. According to Brewer, the
 long wait is partly due to wider scope and greater detail in WCAG 2.0,
 and the WAI team have also consulted widely on the new guidelines
 she said. "We've sought extensive input from users of WCAG 1.0
 around the world during the development of WCAG 2.0. Again, while
 this has added to the development timeline, we feel that this will help
 us meet the goal of developing a guideline which can become a
 convergence target for harmonisation of standards on web
 accessibility," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, WAI is requesting public feedback on the latest draft of
 WCAG 2.0 by the end of May
 ( <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-</a>

 ig/2006AprJun/0023.html ).
 A final release date for the new guidelines has yet to be fixed.
 According to Brewer this is because the results of the public
 consultation need to be absorbed and an amended draft drawn up, and
 then W3C will examine the proposed new guidelines before giving
 them its final stamp of approval.
</p>
<h3 id="i77-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Mobile Journey Planner Under Development.</h3>
<p> 
 A device providing personalised journey planning aimed at passengers
 with a disability is under development and will be tested by vision
 impaired people in England and Ireland this Summer.
</p>
<p> 
 The project team is developing a personal digital assistant (PDA) with
 built-in mobile phone and audio output aimed at people with mobility
 impairments to guide users to and from public transport networks and
 enable them to request accessible travel information on the move.
 'MAPPED,'
 (<a href="http://www.bmt.org/brochures/Focus%20Issue%202%202005.pdf">http://www.bmt.org/brochures/Focus%20Issue%202%202005.pdf</a>
) a three-year European Commission funded programme, uses software
 that runs both on a central server and on the PDA. The servers and
 client "talk" to each other over the General Packet Radio System
 (GPRS) mobile phone network.
 "Typically a user will enter the start and end points of a route they
 want to travel along into the PDA. MAPPED will know where the user
 is because it contains a handheld geolocation receiver that
 communicates with satellites. It will then suggest a route and at all
 times send accessibility information relevant to their location."
 There are also plans for the device to allow users to make advance
 bookings for assistance at underground stations, for example, possibly
 via SMS text sent from the device.
</p>
<p> 
 "Public transport is notoriously underused by people with a disability,"
 research scientist Dr Gary Randall of British Maritime Technology
 (BMT -
 <a href="http://www.bmt.org/">http://www.bmt.org/</a>
 ), developing the device, told delegates at this month's seminar on
 location-based services for people with a disability
 (<a href="http://www.tiresias.org/phoneability/seminar_location_based_services">http://www.tiresias.org/phoneability/seminar_location_based_services</a>

 .htm )
 hosted by PhoneAbility
 ( <a href="http://www.tiresias.org/phoneability/">http://www.tiresias.org/phoneability/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 According to Randall, when it comes to journey planning there is a
 lack of accessible information for passengers with a disability. "The
 combination of services that MAPPED offers is new - all types of
 routing and accessibility information and reservation-making."
</p>
<p> 
 But digital maps do not currently include information needed by
 people with mobility impairments on steps, road gradients doorways,
 paths and lifts for example. "Maps need augmenting to include
 information we need," Randall said. "It's been a real slog to get the
 data together and handle the complexity of that data," Randall said.
 Eventually, the device will enable users to add relevant details to maps
 as they encounter them.
</p>
<p> 
 Following trials in Dublin in Ireland and Winchester in England,
 further tests will take place in Barcelona, Spain and Genoa, Italy, in co-
 operation with European mobility project ASK-IT
 ( <a href="http://www.ask-it.org/">http://www.ask-it.org/</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i77-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessible Multifunction Device To Launch This Year.</h3>
<p> 
 A product providing access to a wide range of digital media all in one
 package is set to launch by the end of this year. The Digital Media
 Centre combines the functions of a Freeview digital TV set-top box,
 digital radio tuner, and disc player and recorder.
</p>
<p> 
 The Digital Media Centre, developed by Portset Systems
 ( <a href="http://www.portset.co.uk/pdmc.htm">http://www.portset.co.uk/pdmc.htm</a>
 ), provides access to electronic programme guides in audio or on-screen
 formats, audio-described TV and DVD content, audio CDs and talking
 books in the Daisy format. The system can be used with or without a
 TV set. A hard drive is built into the system, enabling users to record
 up to 100 hours of TV content directly, or to pause live TV content and
 resume where they left off.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as recording onto the internal hard drive, users can record onto
 audio CDs. For users with partial vision, Digital Media Centre can be
 connected to a TV, accessing programme guides on-screen as well as
 via an audio output provided by a synthetic voice. Users can adjust the
 size and colour of the on-screen display to suit their needs.
</p>
<p> 
 These features add to the functionality of an earlier model that has
 been available since January this year. According to Graham Thomas,
 chief executive of Portset Systems, the new features were prompted by
 feedback from users. "We've had a large order book since we
 launched, and some very useful comments from customers," he said.
 According to Thomas, the new Digital Media Centre will retail at
 around 900 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 At present, the other option for users needing audio-described digital
 TV content via Freeview is the Netgem i-Player, a set-top box that
 doesn't have the Digital Media Centre's range of functions.
</p>
<p> 
 Availability of audio described content via digital TV is one of the
 issues covered by a public consultation run by the regulator Ofcom on
 access to broadcast services. The closing date for responses is 8 June
 2006. For more information see:

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Double Launch For Accessibility Boosting Campaigns.  </h3>
<p> 
 Efforts to communicate the basic points of good practice in technology
 design to a wider audience have been boosted by the launch this month
 of two initiatives aiming to bring users, policymakers, and the private
 sector together.
</p>
<p> 
 On 5 May, 2080partners,
 ( <a href="http://www.2080partners.com/">http://www.2080partners.com/</a>
 ), a group that includes the British Dyslexia Association, launched the
 Well Adjusted Campaign, which aims to draw up a list of the top 10
 reasonable adjustments that will improve the accessibility of web sites.
</p>
<p> 
 The campaign will consult with accessibility experts and the private
 sector to draw up good practice guidelines that are effective, but easy
 to understand. "We're aiming at people who want to do it, but find
 accessibility scary and complicated," said Sally Hayward of the
 2080partners team.
</p>
<p> 
 Separately, a group of organisations including The Royal National
 Institute for Deaf People ( RNID -
 <a href="http://www.rnid.org.uk/">http://www.rnid.org.uk/</a>
 ) is launching an initiative to draft a 'charter for disabled people and
 ICT'. The initiative, which launched on 15 May at a Parliamentary
 reception, aims to draw on a broad range of consultees to raise
 awareness of inclusive design and identify its key principles. The end
 result will be a statement that is easy to understand and can fit on a
 single sheet of paper.
</p>
<p> 
 The project is funded by the Alliance for Digital Inclusion, a pan-
 industry body focused on the wider impact of ICTs in society. A web
 site has been set up for discussion and feedback at:

<h3 id="i77-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Cost Analysis:</h3>
<p>  In response to Fay Rohrlach's contribution on the high cost of assistive technology in the March issue of E-Access
 Bulletin, Stefan Slucki from South Australia writes: "It's a no-brainer
 that Fay 's call for less expensive, quality assistive technology products
 sounds appealing.
</p>
<p> 
 "Rather than stop at stating this truism, I'd like to suggest that
 blindness agencies and assistive technology manufacturers be
 encouraged to provide no or low-interest loans or instalment plans to
 enable more visually-impaired potential customers to purchase quality
 equipment. This would both expand their market and maintain a
 responsible attitude to the equipment by those benefiting from it.
</p>
<p> 
 "Complacency in the assistive technology manufacturing community
 has set in due to the development of government sponsorship for work-
 related technology-device purchases, but a significant group of
 visually-impaired people has yet to be seriously considered as potential
 customers."
 [please send further comments to: <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>]</p>
<p> 
 Brian Williams from London also writes in response to Fay's
 comments: "There was a time when, to listen to an audio book you
 needed a gadget to play records. Today you need a cassette player, a
 DAISY player or DAISY software to play the books on your computer
 and some sort of software to enable your computer to talk you, such as
 JAWS.
</p>
<p> 
 "If you want to take your audio books with you on your travels you
 need an accessible MP3 player. Here in the UK the RNIB are to start
 selling an accessible MP3 player costing over 200 pounds. You can
 buy a player which has the same capacity on the open market for less
 than 30 pounds.
</p>
<p> 
 "How can this situation be justified? I know companies are not
 charities but the general public see all this wonderful technology and
 think our lives are being improved. How many of these international
 specialised technology companies offer an extended purchasing option
 enabling blind people to spread the cost over 12 months or more? Even
 if they did, we still pay much more for access to equipment than our
 sighted counterparts.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's like having a wheelchair salesroom at the top of a flight of steps
 and you can have one providing you buy some equipment to get you
 up the steps."

<h3 id="i77-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Broadcast News:</h3>
<p>  Leen Petre, Head of Broadcasting and Talking Images at RNIB writes in response to Roger Petersen from the US
 about his comments (E-Access Bulletin, February 2006), on improving
 access for blind people in the US to television. "The consumer expert
 group on digital switchover in the UK has produced a set of
 requirements for a digital TV system that would be fully accessible to
 older people and people with a range of impairments, including visual
 impairments. There is no equipment on the market at the moment that
 meets all these requirements, but it gives a good specification to put to
 manufacturers should your organisation wish to work with
 manufacturers directly. The document can be found on the RNIB
 website at:

 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>
 ) compliance.
</p>
<p> 
 A web site can pass all WAI accessibility checkpoints but still be
 unusable by disabled people, so disabled-user testing is necessary to
 ensure web sites are genuinely accessible. By testing your web site
 with a range of disabled users you can also get a powerful sense of
 how technical accessibility issues affect people with different
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The PAS 78 'Guide to good practice in commissioning accessible web
 sites' outlines the benefits of disabled-user testing and provides useful
 guidance on how to conduct web site usability testing with disabled
 people. But significant work is still required to carry out the testing
 itself, in terms of recruiting disabled users, administering tests and
 compiling final results. Web site usability testing with a range of
 disabled users is therefore rarely carried out by most organisations - it
 is either too time-consuming to carry out in-house or there is
 insufficient budget to pay an external consultancy to carry out the
 work.
</p>
<p> 
 We launched the Usability Exchange
 (<a href="http://www.usabilityexchange.com">http://www.usabilityexchange.com</a>
 ) in March of this year to overcome many of the problems faced by
 organisations wishing to conduct disabled-user testing. The Usability
 Exchange provides a database of both experienced and inexperienced
 disabled people, as well as an entire usability-testing platform for
 administering usability tests and collecting results. The time and
 expense associated with carrying out usability tests is considerably
 reduced, making it cost-effective for organisations to conduct regular
 usability testing for the first time.
</p>
<p> 
 Within the Usability Exchange disabled testers carry out tests remotely
 using their own computer equipment, at a time when they are most
 comfortable - organisations therefore receive high-quality feedback in
 a matter of days rather than weeks. Organisations can also
 communicate directly with disabled testers to resolve accessibility or
 usability problems, or to organise on-site usability tests. If necessary,
 organisations can also watch testers attempt web site tasks through the
 use of remote viewing software.
</p>
<p> 
 A number of different usability tests can be created within the
 Usability Exchange depending on the experience of the organisation
 concerned. For organisations that have never conducted usability tests
 before, the Usability Exchange's 'Starter' test provides a basic
 indication of the usability of a web site for a range of disabled users.
 Large organisations with their own in-house accessibility or usability
 experts can create 'Advanced' tests with a variable number of tasks,
 questions, and testers. For public sector bodies, the Usability Exchange
 offers a special "Public Sector Package", a cost-effective package of
 products and services for organisations who require regular, high-
 quality disabled-user testing.
</p>
<p> 
 The Usability Exchange can also help with the process of consulting
 disabled people - a key recommendation of PAS 78 is that
 organisations should consult disabled people at the beginning of the
 web development lifecycle. The Disability Equality Duty also requires
 public bodies to involve disabled users when developing online
 services. Through the Usability Exchange, organisations can submit
 questionnaires to a large number of disabled people or invite local
 disabled users to focus groups.
</p>
<p> 
 Prices for Usability Exchange tests start at 299 pounds. Web design
 companies or accessibility consultancies intending to submit a large
 number of tests through the Usability Exchange can sign up as
 "Premium Partners" to receive significant discounts on all submitted
 tests. Premium partners are also included in the Usability Exchange's
 "Premium Partner Network", a database of organisations offering
 accessibility and usability-related services to customers who may
 require them.
</p>
<p> 
 By using our existing database of disabled testers, we plan to provide
 manual WAI-compliance checking in the near future, our ultimate goal
 is to provide a one-stop shop for all organisations requiring
 accessibility and usability services. Towards the end of 2006, we also
 hope to launch the Usability Exchange in the US and in selected
 European countries.

 Exchange.

<p> 
 Accessibility is an increasingly important issue for free and open
 source software (FOSS) developers and advocates. The International
 Organization for Standardisation (ISO) has developed standards for
 ensuring that software is accessible to people with disabilities.
 Governments around the world often require that software procured for
 public use must meet accessibility standards.
</p>
<p> 
 Disabled users and the FOSS community, however, still have a serious
 communication problem. The need for better communication between
 the FOSS community and disability advocates emerged last year, when
 government officials in Massachusetts announced their intention to use
 OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications or
 'OpenDocument' (for more on this, see E-Access Bulletin, January
 2006, issue 73). This is a well-documented, rich file format that can be
 used with any software program. Currently, OpenDocument is
 undergoing an accessibility review process and some of its components
 have already passed World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI) requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 FOSS supporters celebrated the announcement, noting the switch
 would reduce public expenditure, guarantee perpetual access to data,
 and end discrimination. But they were unprepared for criticism from
 disability organisations, such as the Texas-based Disability Policy
 Consortium (DPC) and the Bay State Council for the Blind (BSCB) in
 Massachusetts.
</p>
<p> 
 To address this imbalance, FOSS and industry representatives met last
 November with Massachusetts officials and representatives from
 disability rights groups. The meeting revealed that the FOSS
 community fails to understand or appreciate the needs of disabled
 users, and that the disability community lacks interest in FOSS.
</p>
<p> 
 At the meeting, FOSS advocates explained the relationship between
 the Open Document Format, open standards, and accessibility
 standards and outlined the technical limitations of proprietary software
 such as Microsoft's products. They maintained accessibility in
 Microsoft Office has often been the result of reverse engineering,
 which must be done with each new release using tools from third-party
 vendors. They also pointed out the adoption of a FOSS-based
 accessibility infrastructure would open more jobs to disabled users, in
 positions such as Unix systems administration and web site design.
 But it didn't matter. Disability advocates confirmed the position
 expressed in a Joint Statement on OpenSource and OpenDocuments as
 follows:
   without advanced training to develop a qualified pool of
 talent, new employees at state government agencies with OpenSource,
 OpenDocument (ODF) platforms will be used by everybody but people
 with disabilities because of perceived or real training requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 The disabled users at the meeting summarized their position: "Variety
 is bad, we don't want to have to change." Even if Office 12 (the
 updated version of Microsoft Office due for release later this year) will
 force them to change anyway, the disabled representatives request that,
 as a minimum, "all ODF applications have common functionality and
 [...] the same keyboard shortcuts".
</p>
<p> 
 FOSS developers strive to meet accessibility standards. The web site
 OpenOffice.org is compatible with the JAWS screen reader, though
 problems remain. Also, the Free Standards Group's Accessibility
 Workgroup (FSGA) has asked for feedback on drafts of accessibility
 standards for Linux and Unix.
</p>
<p> 
 Computer science student Fabrizio Marini feels the situation is far
 from optimal. To install Linux, the only solution for him is to find
 somebody without impaired vision who is willing to do it for him.
 "Most Linux documentation is still too technical and difficult for
 newbies," Marini said. For blind users, there is the added burden of
 dealing with resources that aren't accessible, including, ironically,
 some online documentation for Linux-compatible assistive
 technologies. Marini has also been relying on the GNU and Linux Free
 Information Technology guide ("Appunti di Informatica Libera") that
 is an astonishing 8,839 pages long. Marini is testing speech synthesis
 and screen reader programs for Linux.
</p>
<p> 
 Many projects seem to start with ambitious goals and then stop more or
 less half way before being really usable. In my opinion, developers
 need to focus on less products.
 Both in Europe and the US, there is still much to do to reconcile
 disabled users and the FOSS community. Disabled users fail to
 perceive that they have the same needs and rights as everybody else,
 including full control of, and long term access to, government and their
 own private documents; or the fact that some types of software can
 create local jobs for them.
</p>
<p> 
 In the meantime, the most urgent task is to improve documentation.
 Local Linux User Groups could organize ways to connect volunteers to
 assist disabled users with installations. FOSS advocates should contact
 local disability rights groups to let them know what they're doing. They
 may also be able to provide more feedback about needs in your
 community.
</p>
<p> 
 We need to lobby for more public funding for research projects that
 advance the development of the FOSS accessibility infrastructure. We
 also need to move towards mandating that only accessibility software
 working with OpenOffice.org and Linux can be purchased with public
 money. If you have other suggestions, I welcome them.
</p>
<p> 
 There is no doubt that current FOSS-only platforms are not ready for
 many disabled users. Disabled users may be helping the FOSS
 community, or at least a large part of it, to finally acknowledge a
 general attitude problem.
