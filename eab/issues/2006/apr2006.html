<h3 id="i76-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Myguide Portal Prepared For Launch</h3>
<p> 
 Tests have begun on MyGuide, a new portal that helps people with
 little experience of the internet start to use email, search for
 information and browse web sites. The six month tests will gather
 feedback from user groups likely to be "digitally excluded", such as
 vision impaired people and the elderly.
</p>
<p> 
 MyGuide is being tested in Leicester, Blackburn, Gloucester, Kings
 Lynn and Wisbech, Southwark and Lambeth with the aim of tackling
 any remaining design flaws, and gaining valuable feedback about how
 useful the service is. The trials are being run by University for Industry
 (UfI - <a href="http://www.ufi.com/home/default.asp">http://www.ufi.com/home/default.asp</a>
 ), the body responsible for delivering the Learndirect service and running
 the 6,000 UK online centres. Depending on the response, MyGuide
 could be given a full launch, backed by a government publicity
 campaign later this year.
</p>
<p> 
 Development work on MyGuide, which has a key role in the
 government's digital inclusion strategy, is supported by 22.5 million
 pounds from the Capital Modernisation Fund and co-ordinated by the
 Department for Education and Skills (DfES), originally under the
 project name 'Cybrarian'.
</p>
<p> 
 According to DfES research, about 16 million of the 40 million adults
 in the UK could benefit from the service, including people with
 physical or cognitive disabilities, older people, those with specific
 cultural needs, those with low basic skills, and those who do not yet
 see the benefit of the internet for them.
</p>
<p> 
 MyGuide is designed to be used at home as well as in public libraries
 and community centres. Market research by Ofcom suggests that many
 people, especially the elderly, prefer to learn media skills from family
 and friends or by themselves, rather than in formal groups

 A range of stakeholder organisations are contributing to the project,
 including Age Concern, the Disabled Living Foundation, RNIB and
 RNID.

<h3 id="i76-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Free It Skills Training Launches Across The Uk</h3>
<p> 
 A free training scheme aiming to broaden access to computers for
 vision impaired people went live across England and Northern Ireland
 this month.
</p>
<p> 
 The initiative introduces vision impaired people to computers who
 have little or no experience of technology and will focus on teaching
 those not currently employed or studying and those who have become
 blind later in life.
</p>
<p> 
 Training sessions will see qualified British Computer Association of
 the Blind
 (BCAB - <a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk/">http://www.bcab.org.uk/</a>
 ), tutors teaching basic everyday computer-based tasks to local vision
 impaired people, such as how to write a letter on a computer, send and
 receive email, listen to internet radio stations and scan and magnify
 printed materials. The one-day sessions, the first of which took place at
 Kent County Council, will be conducted in conjunction with local
 blindness societies across the country.
</p>
<p> 
 Students will learn on computers installed with accessible software
 packages: the voice recognition software 'Freedom box,' used for
 accessing email and the internet from US company Serotek
 Corporation
 ( <a href="http://www.freedombox.info/about.html">http://www.freedombox.info/about.html</a>
 ) and 'Guide'
 (
 <a href="http://www.softwareexpress.co.uk/read_more_about_Guide.asp?P=GB">http://www.softwareexpress.co.uk/read_more_about_Guide.asp?P=GB</a>

 P  ),
 a magnifier and screen reader from UK company Software Express.
</p>
<p> 
 The scheme currently has funding for 30 more training sessions and
 has been funded overall by 26,000 pounds raised solely by sales of
 CDs of poetry read by celebrities, written by folk poet Les Barker.
</p>
<p> 
 The launch of 'EyeT4All,' by BCAB was described by BCAB Chair
 Dr Mike Townsend as "a special day" for blind people in the UK.
</p>
<h3 id="i76-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Art Gallery Wins Major Web Accessibility Award</h3>
<p> 
 Online service i-Map, provided by the Tate Modern art gallery, has
 scooped the Jodi Award, the annual prize awarded to web sites that
 make museums, libraries and galleries accessible to vision-impaired
 people.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the judges, the service is one of the few to provide
 comprehensive audio descriptions of exhibits, and is destined to set the
 standard in global best practice, they said. The Tate's i-Map enables
 vision impaired people to engage with exhibits using animation, audio
 and raised image technology.
</p>
<p> 
 The Jodi Award for excellence with low budgets was awarded to
 Speaking Volumes, a community web site enabling vision impaired
 visitors to share opinions about audio books and set up reading circles
 from Wakefield Library
 ( <a href="http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART36038.html">http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART36038.html</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The shortlist included the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery web
 site 'Finds,' for amateur archaeologists run by the British Museum.
 Also shortlisted were Their Reading Futures, an online resource for
 library staff who work with young people and The History of
 Wolverhampton, a web site developed by Wolverhampton Arts and
 Museums Service with input from disabled users.
</p>
<p> 
 Selection for the shortlist was by a combination of automated testing
 and user reports. The winner was chosen by a panel that included Nina
 Baptiste of the Yorkshire Museums, Libraries and Archives Council,
 Ross Parry of the Department of Museum Studies, University of
 Leicester, Jon Pratty from the 24 Hour Museum,  and Marcus Weisen,
 an accessibility consultant for the Museums, Libraries and Archives
 Council.
</p>
<p> 
 Designers of web sites must think beyond accessibility standards such
 as those laid down in the Web Accessibility Initiative
 (WAI - <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/</a>
 ), according to one of the judges, Jon Pratty of the 24 Hour Museum.
 "It's important to get the message across that flare and creativity are
 also important in making a web site accessible and engaging," he told
 E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 id="i76-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Inaccessibility Will Create 'Second Class Citizens,' Says Mp.</h3>
<p> 
 Lack of access to computers by people with a disability will breed a
 class of "new poor," Member of Parliament Ann Widdecombe
 ( <a href="http://www.annwiddecombemp.com/">http://www.annwiddecombemp.com/</a>
 ) said at the launch of an initiative aimed to encourage vision impaired
 people to use computers.
</p>
<p> 
 The MP for Maidstone and the Weald in Kent told the audience at the
 launch event of the national UK computer training skills initiative
 'EyeT4All' last week "You can become - by not having access to
 technology - second class citizens."
</p>
<p> 
 According to British Computer Association of the Blind
 (BCAB - <a href="http://www.bcab.org.uk/">http://www.bcab.org.uk/</a>
 ), just 31 per cent of vision impaired people have access to a computer,
 compared with 58 per cent of sighted people.
</p>
<p> 
 The event was hosted by Kent County Council, who held the first ever
 training day as part of the scheme. EyeT4All aims for vision impaired
 people with little or no experience of computers to learn everyday
 computer skills such as using email, internet, writing letters and
 accessing online audio content.

<h3 id="i76-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Radio Wave:</h3>
<p>  Terry Robinson, owner of Scotland-based online navigation service Describe Online, writes in response to Giovanni
 Urso's comments on two-way radio accessibility (E-Access Bulletin,
 February 2006): "Most modern amateur radio transceivers are
 equipped with a computer interface which allows them to be controlled
 remotely via a home computer or similar device, although you still
 need to buy extra parts to enable this.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'm sure things have moved on and transceivers can be plugged into
 computers without any of this messing about. The more recent models,
 including the Kenwood TS870 are supplied with their own software
 which simulates a transceiver on your computer but I'm not sure how
 accessible these programs are.
</p>
<p> 
 "You could acquire a self-tuning amplifier, thereby bypassing further
 potential accessibility problems.
</p>
<p> 
 "We can bypass many accessibility limitations of transceiver interfaces
 by controlling them remotely via an accessible home computer or
 similar device. I use an old DOS computer which can produce
 synthetic speech and Braille output. I prefer to use the Braille as I don't
 want a synthesiser talking away while trying to read a remote station.
</p>
<p> 
 "We can obtain usable, if not terribly accessible automatic tuning units
 to adjust aerials and can monitor the results through audio power or
 voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) meters. We can also get self-
 tuning amplifiers. I have a rotator which has a tactile knob, so I can
 even set my own beam headings. Again, this can be done via software,
 according to the callsign or locator of the remote station.

 Mark writes: "The international standard for website accessibility is the
 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from the Web
 Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium

 These are a little difficult to read and understand, so the

<p> 
 "These guidelines cover design for all users, taking into account all
 disabilities. Guidelines specific to vision impairment may exist but it is
 not good practice to design for a specific impairment. This is itself
 discriminatory. It promotes the incorrect view that accessibility is
 about design for specific disabilities rather than design for diversity
 and leads to fragmentation of the disability community, dilution of
 power and internal divisions that ultimately work against all people

Section Three - Opinion
- Accessible Gaming

</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Adventures In Endless Soundscapesby Justin Daubenmire
</h3>
<p> 
 I founded BSC Games in 2002 to create accessible computer games for
 the blind or visually impaired. I enjoy it tremendously. It is my deep
 respect and identification with the blind community that encourages
 me to bring audio games to them.
</p>
<p> 
 I oversee the work of the company's dedicated programmers, sound
 engineers, content writers, musicians, sales support, technical support,
 technical writers, marketers, and beta testers, all of whom are blind or
 visually impaired.
</p>
<p> 
 At BSC Games we create exactly the types of games sighted gaming
 enthusiasts play, with one exception: there are no graphics, which
 forces us to be more creative with audio imagery and interactive
 devices such as game pads or joysticks. We have sounds at our
 fingertips to paint the scenes of the games in the mind of the blind
 gamer.
</p>
<p> 
 Although we create audio games for the blind, there are sighted gamers
 who play our games, who enjoy the challenge of an audio game since it
 tests their skills in new ways that graphical games cannot. One of those
 sighted gamers is Anne Walker who plays our Pipe2 Blast Chamber
 game
 ( <a href="http://www.bscgames.com/pipe2.asp">http://www.bscgames.com/pipe2.asp</a>
 ), a game in which players assume the role of an undercover agent whose
 mission is to prevent the San Diego Mafia from blowing up the city.
 "Playing games in the non-visual realm makes it more interesting to
 figure out what it is you are supposed to be doing!" Walker says.
 "Rather than just looking around and going for it, with these games I
 have learned to listen more and be more attentive to what the game
 documentation says."
</p>
<p> 
 It is interesting to see the accessible games industry creating online
 group multiplay games. The fun part of this type of game is joining
 with groups of friends, moving through cities, going on quests for
 items, having adventures and fighting enemies together. These games
 come with a chat program so you can communicate with your friends
 as you quest around the world. Players log on with a user name and
 password and pay a monthly fee to play the game and for good reason:
 hours of entertainment at their fingertips.
</p>
<p> 
 This style of game typically takes mainstream companies four years to
 create. This is roughly equivalent to producing a movie as nearly all
 the same concepts and resources apply to it. It is common to have a
 staff of around five full-time programmers, content writers to create
 scripts that voice actors must act out, graphic designers to create
 pictures to represent cultures, tribes and characters in the world.
 Finally, sound engineers and musicians must co-ordinate their sounds
 and music to fit these and the programming team must programme the
 engine to render all content. To say the least, multiplay games are a
 very involved and extremely expensive effort.
</p>
<p> 
 At BSC Games we are in the initial exploratory phase of programming
 a game with both graphics and audio for the blind and sighted to play
 together. One setback has been finding qualified programmers to assist
 on the project, and trained consultants to instruct us on it. We are
 progressing and hope our next title will be internet-enabled.
</p>
<p> 
 More generally, accessible games developers are slowly making
 progress with programming multiplay games - some companies have
 accomplished this large task already. Our progress is slower, but
 consistent. Because of our limited resources, we have to take smaller
 steps than mainstream game companies but there is a cameraderie
 among us accessible games developers that you don't often see in other
 industries.
</p>
<p> 
 In terms of the future of accessible game development, I think initially
 you will see one-on-one internet-based games then, as resources
 permit, larger games where you can play in teams and quest around
 worlds. Typically, the worlds in these types of games are endless. That
 is what makes them so fun.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>08: How To Buy Software And Not Break The Lawby Ruth Loebl.
</h3>
<p> 
 Have you heard of the public sector duty to promote disability equality,
 which forms part of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA)? From
 the perspective of voluntary bodies and charities like the Royal
 National Institute of the Blind, the duty (known as the Disability
 Equality Duty, or DED) is a great step forward. From your perspective
 it may have had little impact. But if you are involved in IT
 procurement, you should know about it.
</p>
<p> 
 The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) publishes a code of practice
 ( <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/thelaw/publicsectordutycodes.asp">http://www.drc-gb.org/thelaw/publicsectordutycodes.asp</a>
 ) that offers practical guidance about the DED to public authorities. One
 of the examples given by the code reads as follows: "A government
 department that is planning to procure a new IT system should ensure
 that its action plan includes the work it will do to ensure that the new
 system is suitable for use by disabled employees. The action plan
 should also indicate the way it will develop the specification so that the
 system delivers the right products for disabled customers. This might
 include having a means of identifying those customers and their
 requirements, which could lead to being able to, for example, print
 notifications and letters in accessible formats for visually impaired
 people."
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB's legal team receives a large number of complaints about
 citizens' interaction with government. Sometimes 'The System' cannot
 produce the information in a format that the service user can actually
 read. Sometimes it can, but there is no way to indicate that an
 alternative format is required, so print is sent out every single time, and
 the recipient then has to go back and request the format he or she
 actually needs. Every single time.
</p>
<p> 
 The most effective time to address this issue is during procurement, as
 the DRC's code of practice suggests, but what if there is no accessible
 option on offer by suppliers? This is a situation that arose about six
 years ago with a software system called CareFirst, a system designed
 to help local authorities run their social services.
</p>
<p> 
 In 1999, Glasgow City Council was beginning to implement CareFirst
 in its social services department, and all was going well. The system
 met all the council's business requirements, it made data collection and
 reporting much more efficient, and seemed sure to improve services to
 clients. But there was a problem - CareFirst was not accessible, and
 Glasgow employed quite a number of blind people who would need to
 use the system, as well as serving many residents who as service users
 would need accessible output.
</p>
<p> 
 Glasgow contacted quite a few other CareFirst customers, and found
 they had the same problem. Together with RNIB, they approached the
 software developer OLM Group
 ( <a href="http://www.olmgroup.com/">http://www.olmgroup.com/</a>
 ), and explained what was needed. With considerable effort, OLM, RNIB
 and the users fixed the immediate problems by redesigning some of the
 software's interfaces and configuring them for speech output.
</p>
<p> 
 So far so good, but the truth is a one-off fix is never going to change an
 inaccessible product to an accessible one. The real trouble was that
 OLM didn't really see the point of putting a lot of effort into
 accessibility, which they perceived as being peripheral to their main
 business objectives.
</p>
<p> 
 "During the initial testing and configuration to get the system working
 effectively it became apparent that this was going to be a long term
 task and that the costs could potentially be significant," says Brian
 Paterson of Glasgow City Council. "We also realised that other users
 were all at different levels of knowledge, understanding and
 development. It therefore made sense to look at a consortium
 approach."
</p>
<p> 
 The CareFirst Access Consortium was duly formed in 2002, comprised
 of CareFirst customers from local authorities around the UK.
 Membership fees contributed to the campaign and to supporting end
 users, as well as setting up an accessible web site
 ( <a href="http://www.cfaccess.org.uk/">http://www.cfaccess.org.uk/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Realising that numerous customers throughout the UK felt that
 accessibility was an issue that needed to be addressed, OLM started to
 appreciate the benefits of an accessible product to all users, not just to
 those few using speech output.
</p>
<p> 
 The process needed more time than consortium members initially
 anticipated - it has taken six years from that initial contact - but when
 OLM recently announced the latest version of CareFirst, the
 consortium was able to endorse it as a fully accessible product, making
 it a major success story.
</p>
<p> 
 The software has now changed to a browser-delivered application,
 usability is vastly improved (not only for disabled people but for all its
 users), and it has cost OLM no more to develop into an accessible
 version than it would to have made it inaccessible. The consortium's
 work is done, and it will shortly be disbanded.
</p>
<p> 
 Together, the consortium's members have learned a lot about how to
 make software accessible, and not just the technical stuff. We learned
 that a lot of very small steps forward can lead to tremendous outcomes,
 given time. We learned about the power of collaboration, uniting many
 disparate interests behind a common objective.
</p>
<p> 
 We learned there can be benefits for suppliers in compliance as well:
 with awareness of the DED rising, OLM may well be asking procurers
 whether their competitors' products are compliant with the provisions
 of the DDA.
</p>
<p> 
 But perhaps the most important lesson of all is that suppliers listen
 hardest to customers, not to well-meaning representatives of user
 communities like RNIB. Money talks louder than discussion about the
 benefits of accessibility.
