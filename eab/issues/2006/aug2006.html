<h3 id="i80-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Google Research Labs Launches Accessible Search Service.</h3>
<p> 
 Search engine giant Google has launched a service that prioritises its
 search results according to the accessibility of web pages it finds. In
 addition to standard search criteria, Google Accessible Search
 ( <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">http://labs.google.com/accessible/</a>
 ) is designed to rank pages according to how much graphic content they
 contain and how easy they are to navigate using keystrokes only.
</p>
<p> 
 According to project leader TV Raman, of Google's research labs,
 Accessible Search is the first step in the company's strategy to make
 online content more easily available to people with disabilities. "The
 launch of Google Accessible search is a positive step towards our
 overall goal of making the world's information accessible and we're
 very excited about it," he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 According to Raman, work on Google Accessible Search is far from
 finished. "This is an early stage Labs product, and we are planning to
 enrich our features and functionality based on user feedback," he said.
 Future developments will include versions tailored to different
 countries, available in new languages. "Our goal is to provide a more
 useful and accessible web search for the future and as part of this
 commitment we'll continue to refine and improve upon Accessible
 Search in many ways including eventually making it available in other
 languages and countries," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "In the past, visually challenged and blind Google users have often
 waded through a lot of inaccessible websites and pages to find the
 information they want or need. While we still have a lot of work to do,
 Accessible Search is an important step and I hope it improves web
 search accessibility for other people like me who are blind or visually
 impaired," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Interestingly, entering the search terms "search engine" produces
 results that rank Google below one of its main competitors MSN,
 suggesting that the company may need to improve the accessibility of
 its own web pages.
</p>
<h3 id="i80-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Access To Work Funding Closed To Central Government.</h3>
<p> 
 Disability groups have reacted with dismay to news that Access to
 Work funding is to be cut for all central government departments. The
 funding, which has been available since 1994, pays cash sums to
 employers for modifications or specialist equipment needed by
 disabled people in the workplace.
</p>
<p> 
 "We're very concerned about this, it doesn't augur well for the future,"
 a spokesperson for the Disability Rights Commission (DRC -
 <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/">http://www.drc-gb.org/</a>
) told E-Access Bulletin. According to the DRC, payments under the
 Access to Work scheme have already stopped at the Department for
 Work and Pensions, the central government body responsible for
 administering the scheme, and other departments will follow suit.
</p>
<p> 
 According to DRC, the cuts will make it more difficult for central
 government departments meet their own commitments for employing
 people with disabilities. "They are already miserably off-target," said
 the spokesperson. In addition, the cuts come at a time of government
 reforms to the incapacity benefits system aiming to encourage
 recipients back into work. "Our position is that if this is achieved by
 punishment, penalties and sanctions, without the support disabled
 people need it would be brutalism of the worst sort," said the DRC.
</p>
<p> 
 According to DWP, the Access to Work funding previously made
 available to central government will now be paid to private sector
 employers. However, according to the DRC, the government's efforts
 to raise awareness of the funding have been poor. "It's been one of the
 best kept secrets of central government," said the spokesperson.
 According to a report presented to Parliament in October 2005, three-
 quarters of British employers have never heard of the scheme
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mem1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mem1</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i80-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Voice Activation Software Offers 99 Per Cent Accuracy</h3>
<p> 
 A new product from voice technology developer Nuance, Dragon
 Naturally Speaking 9, offers unprecedented levels of voice control over
 PCs and handheld devices.
</p>
<p> 
 The product
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/dragon1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/dragon1</a>
), which removes the need for keystrokes and mouse movements, is
 claimed by Nuance to be 20 per cent more accurate than the product it
 replaces, taking accuracy levels to around 99 per cent.
</p>
<p> 
 Naturally Speaking 9 can also process voice input at speeds up to 160
 words per minute, which means that it is faster and more precise than
 typing. Nuance also claims that enhancements to the software
 eliminate the need for lengthy training to respond properly to the user's
 voice.
 The new release integrates with Microsoft Office, Outlook and Internet
 Explorer, as well as Corel and WordPerfect products. Naturally
 Speaking is also compatible with popular open source-based products
 such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. The product also supports
 wireless technology, being compatible with Nuance-approved
 Bluetooth headsets.
 "It's a tremendous product, there's nothing else like it," Brian Hartgen
 of TandT Consultancy told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>04:  Free Screen Reader Released Online.</h3>
<p> 
 A free screen reader has been launched at Sight Village, the annual
 vision impairment conference dedicated to blindness issues in
 Birmingham, UK.
</p>
<p> 
 The software, called Thunder, which provides all on-screen content as
 'spoken' audio output, can be downloaded from Screenreader.net
 ( <a href="http://www.screenreader.net">http://www.screenreader.net</a>
 ), a new, non-profit, community interest company (CIC) from Choice
 Technology. Thunder was developed in partnership with international
 assistive technology UK company Sensory Software
 ( <a href="http://www.sensorysoftware.com/">http://www.sensorysoftware.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The screen reader is free to individual users, although organisations
 must pay a yearly subscription according to their size. Users will need
 a computer running Windows 2000, XP or Vista as well as speakers or
 headphones. "It will meet most of the needs of many blind users
 whether beginners or seasoned operators," Roger Wilson-Hinds, co-
 director of Screenreader.net, told E-Access Bulletin.
 "Apart from being free to blind home users, there is far less chance of
 conflict with other software running on a computer. This has very
 positive support implications and is great for family users"
 Other screen readers on the market include the widely-used 'JAWS for
 Windows' from US company Freedom Scientific, which costs 800
 pounds and Window Eyes from GW Micro, also in the US, which costs
 380 pounds. Another free screen reader 'Orca' is currently under
 development as the default screen reader of Ubuntu, an operating
 system based on the Linux open source platform.
</p>
<p> 
 "We support anything that will give visually impaired people more
 access to technology at a lower cost," RNIB's Head of Products and
 Publications John Godber, in response to the launch.

<h3 id="i80-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Records Straight:</h3>
<p>  Matthew Cock of the New Media Unit at the British Museum writes in response to a story published in the last
 issue, 'British Museum Launches Audio Described Online
 Collections.' Matthew writes: "I would like to set a few things straight
 about the two features we've launched. We've added one new tour with
 Audio Description of 20 objects to COMPASS
 (www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass),
 not a series of tours, as your article stated.
</p>
<p> 
 "The article says '. . . some people reported the galleries' audio
 programmes to be lacking in detail.' We're not aware of any problems
 or comments on the content of the tours and we're not clear what you
 mean by the 'galleries' audio programmes. We've offered a web-based
 service for the Museum's web visitors, not at this stage part of any
 wider programme in the British Museum or sector.
</p>
<p> 
 "The article also states 'There are links on each web page
 containing an mp3 sound file of a description of a specific object
 which can be downloaded onto portable mp3 players.' This is in fact
 the primary way that we have offered the audio files. Visitors to the
 site can listen to the audio through their web browser, or download the
 file for future use on their mp3 players.
</p>
<p> 
 "Regarding the text-to-speech facility, Readspeaker, which we've
 launched on children's COMPASS
 (www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/childrenscompass),
 is aimed mainly at children with reading difficulties, and not, as you
 say in your article, visually impaired. We've been very careful not to
 claim this as a facility primarily aimed at improving access for blind
 and partially sighted users, as we have been advised that Readspeaker,
 is not an adequate substitute for screen readers or magnification
 software.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'm sorry to say audio is not yet available on any of the public access
 terminals inside the Museum, though this is of course highly desirable,
 and something we're working on offering in the future."
 [further responses to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>]</p>
<p> 
 Gustaw Kon from Germany also writes in response to the British
 Museum story: "It is good that your sponsors got their advert. Their
 product is pricey and only suitable for organisations.
</p>
<p> 
 "No mention was made of the URL of the British Museum audio
 description site. Kind of useless really! [You could] just give the web
 address and let all those interested log on and make their own decisions
 and comments. Simple, don't you think? Cheap too, dare I say
 obvious?
</p>
<p> 
 [Editor's Note: Readspeaker are not currently sponsors of any of our
 activities, and the decision to cover the story was made independently
 by
 our editorial team. The omission of the web address was regrettable,
 however, and an oversight: we always intend to list all relevant web
 addresses in our stories. So apologies for that.]

<h3 id="i80-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: E-Group Debate:</h3>
<p>  The debate on accessible e-groups continues. Deborah Hart of Women in London's Microyster computer group
 writes: "I was so astonished to see [Rich Caloggero's] reply to the
 enquiry you posted for me. Anyone who has used Yahoo will know
 that to configure a group you have to access the options via the
 web. Not only does this take you through the hideous process of
 creating a Yahoo identity - Google groups at least have an accessible
 alternative to the captcha graphic they use - but then all the other
 options of whether the group is to be private, how emails are to be
 delivered, etc, have to be set up via the web. This is also true for
 individual subscribers who may want to only receive emails as a
 digest.
</p>
<p> 
 "This is very disheartening. Despite the millions of pounds going
 into voluntary sector ICT via the Change Up scheme, very few
 practical day-to-day working solutions are likely to result, just more
 websites, and second tier groups giving theoretical advice.
</p>
<p> 
 I suspect a Mailman [the free software for managing electronic mail
 discussion and e-newsletter lists] type list would be easier to
 administer, but this type of service is usually out of the league of small
 self help groups. I was hoping to hear of a system that would allow a
 group of women with disabilities to be independent of 'help'.
 [further responses to <a href="mailto:inbox@headstar.com">inbox@headstar.com</a>].</p>
<p> 
 On the same topic and in response to Rich Caloggero's contribution on
 e-groups last issue, Kim Walker writes: "I am a freelance computer
 adviser assisting charities for the disabled in Edinburgh, Scotland. A
 chat group for some disabled people is required and Yahoo groups may
 be the answer but, although it is good to see that [their] Captcha is not
 a problem, is the Yahoo groups' site W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
 approved? Is it truly accessible to people using screen readers, switch
 access, on-screen keyboards or keyboards only, for example? If not,
 could you recommend any Bobby approved sites that would qualify,
 which are not barred by the Captcha problem?

<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: A Victory For Persistent Pestering.By Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 The menus on DVD disks are hard enough to navigate for sighted
 people, with jumbles of animated images often overlaid with confusing
 text menus leading to different episode or scene selections, and other
 disk features.
</p>
<p> 
 For blind people, however, finding one's way around a disk is all but
 impossible, even if the disk features an audio description track which
 allows them to enjoy and understand the film itself. The problem is,
 how does the user know how to access the audio description track, or
 how to choose an episode, or even know which disk is which?
</p>
<p> 
 At last month's annual Sight Village conference in Birmingham
 ( <a href="http://www.qac.ac.uk/sightvillage">http://www.qac.ac.uk/sightvillage</a>
 ), for which E-Access Bulletin was the main media partner, a prototype
 talking DVD disk was unveiled by the RNIB aimed at tackling these
 problems.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently in development in partnership with the BBC, which has
 implemented it on its new Doctor Who DVDs, the disk automatically
 starts with audio navigation, and then you use up and down arrows to
 access spoken commands such as Episode Selection, Play All or
 Special Features. Other functions reveal how many options there are,
 and give an overview of the disk's entire contents.
</p>
<p> 
 "For the first time, absolutely everything on the disk's menus can be
 accessed through sound," Joan Greening of the RNIB told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 The Dr Who disks talk as soon as you put them into an ordinary
 mainstream DVD player. "It says 'Series 1, Disk 3', or whatever, so it
 is immediately clear which one it is out of a potential jumble of disks.
 How often have you dropped the lot on the floor?" Greening said, to
 sympathetic murmurs from the audience.
</p>
<p> 
 Greening says the RNIB would like this prototype development work
 to lead to an industry standard for audio navigation, but it would be a
 de facto standard rather than a formal technical standard with the RNIB
 as its guardian. "We just want it to be out there."
</p>
<p> 
 As well as audio navigation, which was needed on all disks, as many
 films as possible needed to be audio described, she said. The whole
 Doctor Who series is audio-described, following talks with the RNIB,
 as are around 150 films, most of which are listed on the RNIB website
 at:
 <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/dvd">http://www.rnib.org.uk/dvd</a>

</p>
<p> 
 Audio description is now part of the mainstream product for these
 DVDs, something for which the RNIB and other campaigners had been
 pressing for years, Greening said. "It will normally say on the back of
 the box if it is audio described".
</p>
<p> 
 Notable recent victories for Greening's own long-term, dogged
 campaigning work for RNIB have been pledges from Buena Vista and
 Warner Brothers to audio describe all future films, she says. Part of the
 problem faced has been identifying the right person to lobby in each
 film company, she says, as most do not have anyone tasked specifically
 with improving the accessibility of their output. But her persistence has
 paid off. "I'm like a dog with a bone, I don't give up, and I can pull in
 people to support us like people from the UK Film Council.
</p>
<p> 
 "Without RNIB there would be no audio description in this country, it
 would not be in the cinemas, it would not be on DVDs. If you ever go
 to broadcasting meetings, there is never anyone there representing
 blind people unless we are there. But we're there now at Ofcom and
 other meetings. Now we're leading the world in audio description.
</p>
<p> 
 Also on display in Birmingham this year was the Digital Media Centre
 from Portset Systems, the first receiver and player for TV, radio and
 teletext purpose-built for blind people
 ( <a href="http://www.portset.co.uk/pdmc.htm">http://www.portset.co.uk/pdmc.htm</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The Portset device is the size of a largeish set-top box, and
 automatically tunes in to receive all Freeview TV channels, radio and
 teletext and output all signals as audio only. No TV screen is needed,
 although the device can have a picture signal routed through it to a TV
 set and tune in to a different channel at the same time.
</p>
<p> 
 A series of large, colourful buttons of different shapes laid out in
 logical clusters allows users to navigate channels and access an
 electronic programme guide that includes current and future
 programme start, finish and running times, plus descriptions of what is
 on now and what is on next. A teach mode helps users learn keypad
 functions and layouts.
</p>
<p> 
 The device receives digital radio, although it does not convert the text
 information stream broadcast with digital radio into an audio stream. It
 can record radio or TV onto an internal hard drive with a
 programmable timer setting, although it does not connect to a
 computer. It can play CDs and an upgrade to the system allows it to
 play DVDs, although it cannot record to DVD.
</p>
<p> 
 At a cost of 859 pounds, it is not cheap, so it remains to be seen how
 many users will opt for specialist systems such as this now rather than
 wait to see if cheaper mainstream technologies are made more
 accessible and usable through innovations like the DVD audio
 navigation being developed by the RNIB and the BBC.

 "There are too few examples of game accessibility," Richard van Tol
 told E-Access Bulletin at last month's annual game developers
 conference Develop held this year in Brighton, England and hosted by
 Independent Game Developers Association ( IGDA -
 <a href="http://www.igda.org/">http://www.igda.org/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 There are around 200 audio games - those that use only sound to guide
 players - in existence today. Many are based on traditional board
 games such as Monopoly with sound added to represent players
 moving squares, picking a card and so on. But the majority are "boring
 and behind the times," according to van Tol, of the Bartim&#233;us
 Accessibility Foundation
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bart1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bart1</a>
 ) in the Netherlands, and a member of IGDA's game accessibility
 special interest group (GA SIG -
 <a href="http://www.igda.org/accessibility/">http://www.igda.org/accessibility/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "If you compare games from five years ago to now, there's hardly any
 increase in quality," said van Tol. He said the audio quality of many
 accessible games is basic, with some even sounding akin to alarm
 clocks. "That's what we're trying to change with the SIG," he said.
 Van Tol said many of the most innovative and exciting examples of
 accessible or audio games are to be found in the form of research and
 development projects of University students and this must change.
</p>
<p> 
 The GA SIG has among it's objectives: ". . . to help bridge the
 knowledge gap about how to increase the accessibility of mainstream
 games that exists between disability groups and game developers and
 game developers and publishers." In closing or at least narrowing this
 chasm, the group acts as an intermediary between disabled gamers and
 the mainstream game development industry, and informs companies
 creating accessible games will ultimately increase their market.
</p>
<p> 
 The group also notifies companies when they unwittingly create
 accessible games, a not uncommon occurrence according to van Tol.
 Video or arcade games are good examples. "Many are automatically
 accessible but the developers don't know that," said van Tol. "The
 genre of 'beat-em-up' games is really accessible," he told E-Access
 Bulletin. Last year the GA SIG told the company behind one popular
 mainstream games console their efforts to add extra features such as
 adjustable font size, considered "cool" and perhaps even gimmicky to
 sighted players, were in fact making their games accessible to vision
 impaired gamers and consequently opening their market.
</p>
<p> 
 Now, in the bid to lift flagging innovation and encourage the
 development of more imaginative accessible games, the GA SIG has
 invited some of the world's largest technology companies to submit
 games accessible to the widest possible audience for a worldwide
 contest, 'Accessibility idol.' Contestants will demonstrate their
 accessible game in a 'show' in the style of the popular TV singing
 contest Pop Idol at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco
 next March. The GA SIG team are seeking judges and disabled
 'coaches' to advise contestants as their game develops.
</p>
<p> 
 Another competition from game remake company Retro Remakes
 ( <a href="http://www.retroremakes.com/comp2006/">http://www.retroremakes.com/comp2006/</a>
 ) calls on contestants to create: 'good remakes of good games that
 anyone can play, regardless of their ability.'
</p>
<p> 
 And games programmers and writers are invited to submit entries for a
 contest for a contest from free online computer software resource
 Donation Coder
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/agame1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/agame1</a>
 ), based in the US. Entrant submit their games in two categories: audio-
 only or 'switch' games, where the only input is a single button, such as
 the spacebar, for people with mobility impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 But there are new signs emerging of innovative accessible games
 development. One of the most exciting examples is a location-based
 game for vision impaired and sighted players that uses satellite
 navigation system Global Positioning System (GPS) and 3D sound to
 guide vision impaired players to move around a large physical area
 such as a field or large room as they play. A shooting game, the player
 is equipped with a backpack containing a laptop, headphones, a GPS
 module, a head tracker and a modified joystick. The development
 team, comprising seven students under the Bartim&#233;us Accessibility
 Foundation, are presently seeking funding to release the game, Demor,
 on the market.

 ).</p>

<p> 
 But to improve the accessibility overall of games, and to begin to make
 imaginative, exciting games the norm, van Tol calls on gamers
 themselves to make a noise. "I've noticed especially on [blind gamers'
 online magazine] Audessey, many gamers want to make themselves
 heard. The blind community is active but only within its own silo,"
 said van Tol. "We need a community of disabled gamers to stand up
 and talk to the industry and make themselves heard more."
