<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Sponsored Notice: BT Age and Disability Action Team- BT recognised for serving the needs of people with disabilities.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 The BT Age and Disability Action team's approach to accessibility has
 been recognised by the Southampton Centre for Independent Living in
 their annual Disabled People's Business in the Community Award.
</p>
<p> 
 The team beat off stiff competition to scoop the award in the Disability
 Equality Achievement for Services and Utilities category, recognising
 BT's long standing commitment to serving the needs of people with
 disabilities including the recent introduction of product information in
 British Sign Language.
</p>
<p> 
 Accepting the award for BT, David Barrett said "It's great to be
 recognised in this way and this award will certainly inspire the team to
 continue striving for more widespread inclusion of people with
 disabilities".

<h3 id="i83-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Boost For Fans Of Bestselling Fiction.</h3>
<p> 
 The best-selling writer and Children's Laureate Jacqueline Wilson has
 become the first UK author to release accessible versions of a new
 book at the same time as its standard print version.
</p>
<p> 
 Large print, audio, Braille and DAISY digital talking book editions of
 'Starring Tracy Beaker' appeared last month alongside the mainstream
 version. Earlier this year, Wilson became the first author to ask her
 publisher to add accessibility as a clause to her publishing contract, and
 has committed to ensuring all her future books are accessible to her
 vision impaired fans (see E-Access Bulletin, issue 75, March 2006).
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile the National Library for the Blind (NLB) has announced it
 has received a donation of 10,290 pounds from the organisers of the
 Man Booker Prize to create Braille, large print and DAISY formats of
 the novel that won this year's prize and the five other shortlisted books.
</p>
<p> 
 This is the third year that Man Booker Prize short listed novels have
 been produced in Braille and large print but the first time they have
 been produced in DAISY format.
</p>
<p> 
 This year, publishers were required to supply text files of the
 shortlisted books and all of them have done so. This speeds up the
 production process.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently only 4.4 per cent of books are translated into formats that
 visually impaired people can use, and conversion often takes months or
 even years, according to the NLB.
</p>
<p> 
 The RNIB and NLB are among 20 organisations which in 2002 formed
 a 'Right to Read Alliance', calling for people with sight impairment to
 be able to access the same books at the same time and the same price
 as everyone else.
</p>
<h3 id="i83-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Experts To Provide Remote Help For Computer Users.</h3>
<p> 
 A low cost service to remotely evaluate the computing needs of
 disabled people is to be launched this week by AbilityNet, the UK
 computing charity for people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Aimed at users in the home, workplace, college, school or
 rehabilitation unit, the 'Barrier-free assessment service' will enable
 users to be assessed by a trained consultant wherever they are located
 to establish which adjustments or assistive technologies are needed.
</p>
<p> 
 Once users have completed an online assessment form to gather
 background information about them, assessors make the necessary
 changes to the user's computer, using 'GoToAssist' remote desktop
 support from technology company Citrix. This allows assessors to
 download screen reader and magnifier demonstration software onto
 clients' computers from their own.
</p>
<p> 
 AbilityNet assessors plan to talk to users over the 'voice over IP'
 (VoIP) telephony service Skype and a webcam will be loaned to users
 so assessors can spot any physical access problems in their work
 station set-up. AbilityNet has a small stock of equipment to lend to
 clients so they can "try before they buy" any assistive devices or
 software.
</p>
<p> 
 "It's about what can you do to improve the accessibility of your work
 station without spending much money," David Banes, AbilityNet's
 Director of Operations told E-Access Bulletin. "The biggest barrier we
 face is cost."
</p>
<p> 
 The scheme aims to eliminate the need for users to travel to an
 AbilityNet centre, saving time and money, although the initiative does
 not replace AbilityNet's existing in-centre assessments. According to
 Banes, these can be "expensive to the point of insupportable,"
 particularly where consultants need to visit people in remote areas such
 as the UK's small islands in Scotland, he told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The programme, which follows a year-long pilot in Scotland funded
 initially by the Big Lottery Fund, will be launched at an event at the
 Houses of Parliament in Westminster on 22 November.
</p>
<h3 id="i83-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Public Sector Needs Improved Guidance On Web Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 A group of leaders in the field of accessibility, including representation
 from the government's, Central Office of Information (COI -
 <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/">http://www.coi.gov.uk/</a>
 ) are to call on the public sector to rethink policy and guidelines on
 accessibility of the web to people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 19 experts from higher education, the private and non-profit
 sectors and central government, who met this month at the
 Accessibility Summit II in York, are to call for change in the way web
 accessibility is advocated particularly in local and central government,
 education and the museum and cultural sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 "What we're trying to do is address what we collectively felt are
 weaknesses in the way web accessibility is currently, promoted
 portrayed, supported and implemented in the public sector," said David
 Sloan, Research Assistant at the School of Computing at the University
 of Dundee and co-founder of the summit.
</p>
<p> 
 Sloan said the meeting unanimously agreed that the globally
 recognised World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
 ) were inadequate. "This situation [affects] formulation, implementation
 and monitoring of policy and law relating to accessible online
 information and services, but it also leaves web authors uncertain about
 what they can and can't do," Sloan said.
</p>
<p> 
 "At the moment the government is following highly specific [WCAG]
 points: some work, some don't," said Summit delegate Kevin Carey,
 Vice-Chair of the Royal National Society of the Blind and director of
 digital inclusion charity HumanITy.
</p>
<p> 
 Initially, a manifesto will be published by the end of this year outlining
 both the shared vision of Summit delegates and how best to implement
 improvements. The group is soon to reconvene to further discuss how
 each person can convey these messages to the communities they have
 most influence over.

<h3 id="i83-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Bbc Blog On Second Generation Web Accessibility Goes Live.</h3>
<p> 
 A blog dedicated to the accessibility of the latest web-based tools and
 applications, 'web 2.0 technologies,' has been launched by the BBC
 online disability magazine 'Ouch!'
</p>
<p> 
 The blog, 'Access 2.0'
 ( <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/access20/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/access20/</a>
 ), focuses on the accessibility of so-called 'Web 2.0' applications, the
 second generation of internet-based services. These could include
 "mash-ups" - applications that integrate content in various formats
 from one or more sources on the web; social networking sites; or wikis
 - websites that allow visitors to add, remove and edit content.
</p>
<p> 
 "We are all asked to be more than spectators on the web now, we're
 becoming participants. But if these websites are excluding sections of
 society then that's a real problem," said blog author Paul Crichton.
</p>
<p> 
 The blog site invites the public to comment on issues relating to Web
 2.0 accessibility and focuses on the ways disabled people currently use
 the internet. "If we can push readers in the direction of good,
 accessible websites that help them to participate, that's got to be a good
 thing. Similarly, anything that can highlight accessibility issues to web
 2.0 developers has got to be good," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 "Whether Web 2.0 is a revolution or just evolution, there's no doubt
 that the landscape of the web is changing," he told E-Access Bulletin.
 "It is still a place to gather information, or buy CDs [but] it's also
 becoming a place where so much more is going on, from social
 networking sites like MySpace, to Video-on-Demand. That's web 2.0 -
 simple in theory but if such things were made inaccessible it could be
 quite debilitating," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 The Access 2.0 blog will also focus on the latest web accessibility-
 related developments at the BBC. "I'm independent from the BBC so
 I'm in a position where I can be critical of what they do as well. In
 fact, they're encouraging me to do so," said Crichton, who is also a
 director of web consultancy Net-Progress
 ( <a href="http://www.net-progress.co.uk/">http://www.net-progress.co.uk/</a>
 ), and creator of accessible search engine Net Guide
 ( <a href="http://www.net-guide.co.uk">http://www.net-guide.co.uk</a>

<p>  Rich Caloggero, adaptive technology consultant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Adaptive Technology for
 Information and Computing laboratory
 ( <a href="http://web.mit.edu/atic/">http://web.mit.edu/atic/</a>
 ) writes in to comment on a news in brief story from the last issue of the
 bulletin, 'Multimedia Initiative.'
</p>
<p> 
 We wrote: "The first draft of guidance for website developers to create
 accessible multimedia content has been released by the World Wide
 Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI): the
 Accessible Rich Internet Application suite."
</p>
<p> 
 Rich writes: "This is not about multimedia, although it could be. What
 they have rolled out is a suite of documents meant to be digested and
 acted upon by developers and others in the business of creating 'Web
 2.0' sites. These are sites which [use] modern web browser technology
 to produce sites which look and feel like desktop graphical user
 interface (GUI) applications.
</p>
<p> 
 These sites are comprised of normal HTML elements such as headings,
 lists and paragraphs; things which current screen reader technology
 can handle quite well. However, they also contain custom-made
 "widgets." Think of these as custom-built form controls. They can act
 just like things screen readers handle quite well, like check boxes,
 buttons, or list boxes but because they are custom-built from more
 basic HTML fragments, the screen reader does not see them for what
 they are; it sees the elements from which they are built. This prevents
 screen reader users from interacting with these sites.

 "The problems are mostly concerning the appearance of toolbar

<p>  Steve Cutway, an Information Access Specialist in the IT Services department of Queen's University in

 Group at WGBH TV in Boston.
</p>
<p> 
 "Quality has a lot to do with financial support and the WGBH

 "It may interest you to know how one Canadian satellite company, Bell

 shows are distributed or produced in the UK but in North America, the
 Separate Audio Program (SAP) Channel is used. Needless to say, the
 method of turning on the SAP Channel varies widely among TV and
 VCR brands with the result that availability of described programming
 is problematic. This means producers and networks claim there is no
 support for it, which is far from accurate.
</p>
<p> 
 "Bell ExpressVu eliminates the need to worry about turning on the
 SAP Channel by distributing the described content on a separate

<p> 
 "I strongly believe that blind people do not just have to follow in the
 wake of the sighted, but that they can indeed be trailblazers," Amar
 Latif told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 After finding the experience of travelling to many destinations with
 various organisations restricting and stifling as a blind holidaymaker,
 Amar Latif decided to set up his own company to provide customised
 trips for blind and sighted travellers.
</p>
<p> 
 While there is a 'buddying' system in place, meaning vision impaired
 travellers have a sighted guide that changes each day, independence is
 a key element of the trip. The website says: 'Travellers with
 Traveleyes
 ( <a href="http://www.traveleyes.co.uk">http://www.traveleyes.co.uk</a>
 ), are no longer patronized, nor are they placed in the ignominious
 position of having to plead for 'special case' consideration . . .  the
 visually impaired traveller is no longer required to 'tag along' as either
 a welcome or tolerated appendage to the peer-group holiday.'
</p>
<p> 
 Traveleyes destinations have so far included trips through Berber
 villages in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and exploring medieval
 towns in the Tuscan countryside, learning how to cook regional dishes.
</p>
<p> 
 "Accessible travel guides, GPS technology and electronic tactile maps
 can now open up new horizons which are waiting to be explored by the
 visually impaired traveller," Latif said.
</p>
<p> 
 Technology plays a major role in increasing independence during trips,
 according to Latif: his company provides personal digital assistants
 (PDA) with speech technology, an electronic talking tactile map, a
 Braille compass and the Trekker from Humanware, a navigational
 device with global positioning system (GPS) that provides accessible
 street maps from all over the world.
</p>
<p> 
 Last year Latif orchestrated the production of the first accessible
 electronic versions of the popular travel guide series Lonely Planet and
 plans to make them available for all the company's destinations, "so
 that people can develop a good level of knowledge before they travel,"
 he said. There are now 15 on the market, including guides to Greece
 and Andalucia in Spain.
</p>
<p> 
 He says the travel guides have so far been "immensely" popular.
 "Travel guides have not existed before in a format that is so accessible
 to blind people. They help not only to inform, but also to inspire the
 traveller and can be read at home or whilst on the move on personal
 digital assistants (PDAs). Blind and visually impaired people can
 browse through them faster than sighted people are able to do as they
 flick through a print copy in the conventional way," he told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 And the guides have proven to be more than just a way of locating the
 wildest bars and how best to reach the tourist information office. "The
 travel guides have really helped to maintain a strong and constructive
 partnership between the blind and the sighted on a Traveleyes holiday.
 The blind are able to supply the knowledge whilst the sighted can
 supply the eyes," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In the near future, Latif plans to provide further information on
 assistive navigational technologies for vision impaired people on the
 Traveleyes website, set to be re-launched this month, and is soon to
 announce forthcoming holiday destinations for 2007, to include Cuba
 and Gran Canaria in the Spanish Canary Islands.
</p>
<p> 
 "The blind not only can 'lead the blind,' we can also lead the sighted
 too and, for that matter, anyone else interested in creating a better,
 fairer and more universally accessible world."

 ( <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess06/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess06/</a>
 ), the conference hosted by Headstar, the publisher of E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 In an afternoon breakout session, RNIB chief scientist Dr John Gill,
 and Will McMeechan, a business developer at Nationwide Building
 Society, discussed how new technologies will change the way we
 access banking information and make financial transactions such as
 moving money between accounts, for example.
</p>
<p> 
 Before the rise of online services and mobile phones, there were
 already accessibility problems with user interfaces such as cashpoint
 machines, said Gill. Many have different keypad layouts, or vary in the
 options presented to users. Such differences may be negligible to a
 sighted user, but can be a major barrier to vision-impaired users, he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 A concern for vision-impaired people is that in the rush to implement
 new systems such as "Chip and pin", there is a risk we will miss an
 opportunity to standardise user interfaces and simply duplicate the
 problems of the past, said Gill.
</p>
<p> 
 Recent developments in wireless products mean that payments,
 especially for small amounts, will not require users to input a number
 using a keypad, he said. Smartcards are already used to make small
 transactions in parts of the UK, and mobile phones with this
 functionality are almost certain to follow. Adding to the momentum are
 developments such as Near Field Communication (NFC), a wireless
 technology that provides high bandwidth over very short distances.
</p>
<p> 
 Such services could make life easier for vision-impaired people
 because they could enable numerous transactions and information
 requests to be made from a single device. In practice, this could be the
 mobile phone of a vision-impaired user, removing the difficulties
 created by unfamiliar keypads, said Gill.
</p>
<p> 
 "I expect around 50 per cent of all mobile phones will be enabled in
 this way by the end of the decade," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Keypads are only one way among many for users to identify
 themselves, and biometric methods such as matching fingerprints, the
 iris of the eye, or facial characteristics are likely to pass into
 mainstream use. None of these are without problems as forms of
 identification, or as technologies accessible to vision-impaired people,
 said Gill.
</p>
<p> 
 The user interface is only one of the barriers to accessible banking, said
 Will McMeechan, a business developer at Nationwide Building
 Society with an interest in accessibility issues. Efforts to make
 electronic banking services accessible have been patchy and
 uncoordinated because although meeting the needs of customers is a
 major priority for the banking industry, there is little consensus about
 how to tackle accessibility issues in a practical way. "Part of the
 problem is that current anti-discrimination law is seen as ambiguous,"
 he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Banks are almost certainly unaware of the true impact on customers of
 accessibility problems, he said. "It's difficult to find figures for people
 who don't use a service because it is not accessible," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 Participants agreed that a major flaw in our approach to disability is
 that accessibility problems with a product or service only come to light
 after it is launched, rather than before. "Typically, disabled consumers
 find a problem when a product or service is already out there, by which
 time it's too late," one delegate said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, there are problems with ensuring accessibility is included at
 the design stage of a product or service, said Gill. "Board members,
 who are responsible for setting out the direction over the next few
 years, tend to be the right age range - between 50 and 65 years old - to
 understand the importance of accessibility," said Gill.
</p>
<p> 
 "But the designers tend to be at the opposite end of the demographic
 spectrum, young, healthy and often unaware of accessibility issues.
 They are often under pressure to deliver projects on tight timescales
 too."
</p>
<p> 
 "In between is the middle management, who have the power to
 influence designers, but it is difficult to persuade them of the business
 case for change if it doesn't deliver results within six months," said
 Gill.
