<h3 id="i79-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: 'Pop Idol' Style Contest Launched To Find Accessible Games.</h3>
<p> 
 A major international 'Pop Idol' style competition to find the best
 accessible computer games is being promoted as part of a range of
 activities launched this week to raise awareness of the needs of
 disabled gamers.
</p>
<p> 
 'Accessibility Idol', named after the popular TV show, is the
 brainchild of the US-based International Game Developers Association
 ( IGDA -
 <a href="http://www.igda.org/">http://www.igda.org/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The contest will take the form of a show with finalists presenting their
 accessible game to an audience at the Game Developers Conference
 ( <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">http://www.gdconf.com/</a>
 ) in San Francisco, US, in March 2007. Some of the world's largest
 software and gaming companies have been signed up or invited,
 although the association has not yet publicly confirmed participants'
 names.
</p>
<p> 
 The move follows the launch of two other contests launched this month
 to find innovative, accessible games: one from Retro Remakes, which
 redesigns classic video games
 ( <a href="http://www.retroremakes.com/comp2006/">http://www.retroremakes.com/comp2006/</a>
 ) and another from US-based free software company Donation Coder
 ( <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/">http://www.donationcoder.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 And last week, an IGDA special interest group hosted a day-long
 workshop on accessible gaming held as part of the Develop computer
 games conference held in Brighton, England
 (<a href="http://www.tandem-events.com/workshops.html#accessibility">http://www.tandem-events.com/workshops.html#accessibility</a>
 ). E- Access Bulletin will report in full on this workshop in our next issue.
</p>
<h3 id="i79-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Mps Urge 2012 Olympics Venues To Install Audio Description.</h3>
<p> 
 A group of MPs has called for all sporting venues to install audio
 description equipment to provide live commentary for blind fans, and
 in particular to ensure all Olympic venues have this facility ahead of
 the London games in 2012.
</p>
<p> 
 An Early Day Motion laid down in Parliament by the Labour MP
 Andrew Miller and signed by over 40 other MPs praised managers at
 Lord's cricket ground in London for going live last week with audio
 description, and urged all other sports grounds and all Olympic venues
 to follow suit
 (<a href="http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31015">http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=31015</a> ).
</p>
<p> 
 Miller is chair of the Parliamentary IT Committee (PITCOM) and a
 member of the All-Party Parliamentary Olympic and Paralympic
 Group. He told E-Access Bulletin: "When designing a sports venue,
 you need to take into account the needs of people with all disabilities.
 This is established in the Olympic ideals, a principle we've got to strive
 towards. Every citizen has the right that you and I have to enjoy the
 Olympics and support their country". However, he acknowledged
 grounds faced challenges in installing the equipment, not least from
 their cost.
</p>
<p> 
 Marylebone Cricket Club in London launched its ball-by-ball
 commentary service at Lord's in association with the RNIB, BBC
 radio's Test Match Special and BBC London. Commentary is
 transmitted from the ground's media centre to headsets that can be
 worn by blind and partially sighted spectators sitting anywhere around
 the stadium.
</p>
<p> 
 Lord's Communications Officer Neil Priscott said: "We know that
 there are a lot of blind and partially sighted cricket supporters, and it is
 only right for us to have [these facilities]". Lord's also plays host to the
 Blind Cricket Final, an annual event for blind players of a specially
 adapted version of the game.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio description is already offered in several other cricket grounds
 including Old Trafford in Lancashire and the Riverside ground in
 Durham, though coverage is still far from complete.
</p>
<h3 id="i79-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Satellite Location Device 'Accurate To Within A Metre.'</h3>
<p> 
 A prototype handheld device that uses next-generation satellite
 technology to locate its holder to within a metre and speak the results
 into an earpiece has been successfully tested, its Spanish inventors
 have announced.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'MOMO' experiment could pave the way for talking location and
 route-finding products for vision-impaired people about the size and
 weight of a portable digital assistant (PDA). The user chooses options
 from a spoken menu, entering their responses on a keypad.
</p>
<p> 
 The prototype has been developed by the Spanish company GMV
 Sistemas on behalf of the European Space Agency, as part of a
 programme to explore uses of the next generation European satellite
 technology known as GALILEO.
</p>
<p> 
 To improve the accuracy of spatial information delivered to the user,
 the MOMO device combines data from two sources: directly from
 satellites, and also from ground-based computers over the mobile
 phone network.
</p>
<p> 
 According to project leader Sara Guti&#233;rrez-Lanza, the MOMO
 technology could be developed into a commercial product in around
 two years.
</p>
<p> 
 There are also other possible applications for the underlying
 technology, she said. "MOMO is designed for pedestrians, but it could
 also be integrated with public transport systems, such as the timetables
 shown on information panels in buses and trains," she told E-Access
 Bulletin.
</p>
<h3 id="i79-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: British Museum Launches Audio Described Online Collections.</h3>
<p> 
 The British Museum, one of the world's greatest collections of
 historical artefacts, has added audio description features to its main
 online collections for children and adults.
</p>
<p> 
 The museum has installed the Readspeaker SayIt tool
 (<a href="http://www.readspeaker.com">http://www.readspeaker.com</a>
) to allow web users to hear descriptions of all 5,000 key objects within
 its 'COMPASS' and 'children's COMPASS' online collections, from
 Michelangelo's drawings to the Rosetta stone. The service is also
 available on terminals inside the museum.
</p>
<p> 
 The system, aimed at users with impaired vision or learning
 difficulties, does not require the user to download any 'plug-in'
 software for their web browser, though it does require a computer
 sound card.
</p>
<p> 
 Audio description has also been added to a series of virtual tours of the
 museum, each containing about 20 items from a selected culture, era or
 subject such as silver statues or works by a particular artist.
</p>
<p> 
 The website also lets you change the font, colour and size in the
 browser settings and features a text only version.
</p>
<p> 
 In addition, there are links on each web page containing an mp3 sound
 file of a description of a specific object which can be downloaded onto
 portable mp3 players for use in visits to the museum.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, there is a problem with the audio descriptions. Some
 people reported the galleries audio programs to be lacking in detail. To
 try to overcome these problems, the RNIB is sending 12 vision
 impaired people to 50 different museums and art galleries to
 investigate any problems faced.

<h3 id="i79-10"><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Opinion Response:</h3>
<p>  Tim Connell, Managing Director of Quantum Technology in New South Wales, Australia writes in response to Kevin
 Carey's opinion feature in the June issue of the bulletin, which
 suggested that the answer to true accessibility would only come
 through improvements made by the larger mainstream technology
 companies rather than smaller niche providers of accessibility tools.
</p>
<p> 
 "Kevin has really got it wrong on his opinion piece regarding the Holy
 Grail. This attitude is one I describe as WMD (white, male, and
 developed nation). At a time an estimated 90 per cent of the world's
 blind don't have access to any technology at all, it is a bit rich (so to
 speak) to suggest we abandon the small niche technology developers
 and manufacturers.
</p>
<p> 
 "I wholly support the notion of universal design and agree this is a
 critical issue for the blind community to embrace and champion.
 However it shouldn't be at the expense of the "Techies working on
 flimsy budgets with miniscule markets" because we offer the only
 hope of technology solutions for the marginalised - most blind people
 in developing nations - and the minorities within a minority, such as
 the deafblind. To think that universal design is going to cater for all
 these people in my lifetime or the next is fanciful.
</p>
<p> 
 "Kevin has a highly developed understanding of so-called "high"
 technology and this is the focus of his comments. It is prudent
 however, to remember the vast majority of blind students in the UK are
 still embarking on the path to Braille literacy using either a device
 from 1950 or 1830.
</p>
<p> 
 "There are many areas where the features of access technology can be
 incorporated into mainstream technology, most notably software.
 Hopefully the blind community can continue to embrace the small,
 possibly not all profitable or dynamic, businesses that are dedicated to
 the question of providing access, as well as embrace the notion of
 universal design. I truly believe we need both."

Section Three: Web Accessibility
- User Testing.

</p>
<h3 id="i79-13"><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Nevermind The Guidelines.By Stefan Haselwimmer.
</h3>
<p> 
 In the last couple of years central government has put pressure on local
 authorities to make their websites comply with Web Accessibility
 Initiative (WAI) standards. It is therefore not surprising that councils
 see accessibility primarily in terms of technical accessibility
 guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 With the publication of the British Standards Institution's PAS 78
 accessibility guidelines (free download at:
 <a href="http://www.drc.org.uk/library/website_accessibility_guidance/pas_78.aspx">http://www.drc.org.uk/library/website_accessibility_guidance/pas_78.aspx</a>
), however, it is now important for councils to carry out disabled user
 testing when evaluating website accessibility, rather than relying
 purely on technical accessibility guidelines.
</p>
<p> 
 Testing your website with disabled people can highlight usability
 issues that may make your website fundamentally inaccessible to
 disabled users. Society of IT Management Body 'Socitm Insight,'
 representing ICT management in local public services, therefore
 commissioned the Usability Exchange
 ( <a href="http://www.usabilityexchange.com/">http://www.usabilityexchange.com/</a>
 ) to carry out systematic disabled user testing on their "Top 20" council
 websites, to get a sense of how accessible and usable council websites
 were to real disabled people. Socitm's "Top 20" is a list of the best
 council websites in the UK, based on the results of annual expert
 review, Better Connected.
</p>
<p> 
 Each of the council websites was tested with a range of disabled users
 including visually impaired and dyslexic users and individuals with
 motor impairments. All testers were asked to attempt two tasks on each
 of the 20 websites: find the council's phone number and report an
 abandoned vehicle. Each tester recorded the time it took to complete
 these tasks. They were also asked to note down any accessibility or
 usability issues that they experienced during each task.
</p>
<p> 
 What were the results? The good news was that every tester found the
 council's phone number in 19 of the 20 council websites tested. In
 some cases users took an excessive amount of time to complete this
 task but simple design changes, such as positioning the phone number
 at the top of the home page, would have solved this problem.
</p>
<p> 
 With regard to the 'report an abandoned vehicle' task, the results were
 rather more disappointing. In only 8 of the 20 websites tested did every
 user report an abandoned vehicle successfully. The major problems
 with this task arose from the difficulty of finding the abandoned
 vehicle reporting system. Users had problems finding the reporting
 system through the search engine and the A-Z index, or were confused
 by where the reporting system was located - in some cases under
 'Street defects' or 'Streetcare'.
</p>
<p> 
 Any efforts that may have been made to make the abandoned vehicle
 reporting system accessible were of little benefit to disabled users who
 could not locate the reporting system in the first place.
</p>
<p> 
 On both tasks a range of accessibility and usability problems were
 reported by users, with every council receiving at least three reports of
 an accessibility or usability problem overall. Most of the problems that
 were identified were not traditional accessibility problems, such as
 inaccessible forms or missing 'alt' tags, but usability issues. The
 accessibility and usability problems that were identified were in
 general easy to rectify.
</p>
<p> 
 The results show that even the best councils still have some way to go
 to ensure their websites are really easy to use and fully accessible to
 disabled people. Local councils should therefore carry out user testing
 with disabled users in order to identify and eliminate any usability
 issues that could affect these users.
</p>
<p> 
 Disabled user testing can transform the concept of accessibility within
 local councils, from a theoretical concept concerned with technical
 accessibility guidelines to something much more tangible and
 compelling - there is nothing more compelling than hearing that a real
 disabled user is having problems with your website.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four: Research- Web accessibility
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i79-14"><b class="Ps">+</b>14: Keeping In Context</h3>
<p> 
 Accessibility of the web to end users, regardless of ability or browsing
 environment, is widely accepted as a fundamental requirement if the
 web is to reach its true potential as an enabler for the widest possible
 audience. Indeed, the rights of web users with disabilities are becoming
 ever more defined in anti-discrimination policy and legislation around
 the world.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately, studies have regularly shown that the accessibility of
 websites falls short of an acceptable level. This is despite an ever-
 increasing quantity of work that has gone into developing tools to
 support web content providers in authoring accessible material and
 evaluation of the accessibility of content; developing assistive
 technologies for end users to allow disabled people to overcome or
 reduce the impact of their impairment when interacting with web
 content; and disseminating the importance of, and best practices in,
 accessible web design.
</p>
<p> 
 The reasons behind the continuing disappointing levels of web content
 accessibility have been widely discussed. What seems clear is that,
 while still a factor, a lack of awareness of the importance of
 accessibility among web developers and site commissioners is no
 longer the predominant issue.
</p>
<p> 
 A key challenge is effective and appropriate implementation of
 accessible web design techniques. Other challenges include the
 perceived complexity and cost of the task of making a website
 accessible, and also the need to unambiguously define what is actually
 meant by 'accessible', understand what is required to develop a web
 site to be considered to have met that definition, and to evaluate it such
 that once can judge whether it has met the specified level of
 accessibility. From the disabled web user's perspective, complicating
 factors include the browsing and assistive technologies available, the
 user's ability to use these technologies and the difference between the
 technologies available and those most appropriate for the user's needs.
</p>
<p> 
 We argue that while work to optimise the accessibility of the web
 through the publication and dissemination of a range of guidelines is of
 great importance, there is also a need for a more holistic approach in
 maximising the role of the web in enabling disabled people to access
 information, services and experiences. The persistently disappointingly
 low levels of usability of web content for disabled people indicates that
 focusing on the adoption of accessibility guidelines by content authors,
 tool developers and policy makers is not sufficient for a truly inclusive
 web. This approach fails to acknowledge the role of the web as an
 enabler in a broader context and may stifle creative use of web content
 and experiences to enhance social inclusion.
</p>
<p> 
 Designing digital systems to meet the requirements of the people who
 will be using it is the classic approach to usability. One can group
 requirements into several categories.
</p>
<p> 
 User characteristics are the abilities and disabilities of the target users,
 including perceptual, cognitive, motor, and linguistic abilities. Domain
 requirements are the tasks that need to be supported, group, social and
 cultural dynamics, communication patterns, environmental factors, and
 so on. Technological requirements include issues such as availability
 of hardware and software and the availability of plug-ins. Performance
 requirements specify task success rates, task-completion times,
 satisfaction ratings, and quality of task output, such as comprehension
 outcomes in an e-learning environment.
</p>
<p> 
 Taken together these categories of requirements are often called the
 "context of use".  Ultimately the stakeholders associated with a
 particular digital system want that system to be "successful". Success,
 however, can only be identified and measured if requirements such as
 these are identified and, ideally, specified. The key measure of a digital
 system is whether it fits its context of use: whether the people for
 whom it is designed can use it with acceptable levels of usability, for
 the tasks that they need to do, in the social setting in which these tasks
 take place, using the technologies they have available.
</p>
<p> 
 We argue that only by taking this approach - by considering the
 context of use - can meaningful and productive discussions be
 conducted about the accessibility or usability of a system. Using
 context of use as a benchmark for success also eliminates the illogical
 situation in which some commentators reject sites that are usable by
 disabled people i.e. fit the context of use but do not meet specific Web
 Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG -
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
 ) conformance levels. Appropriate "fit to context of use" should be the
 goal of developers, with a recognition that guidelines can serve as
 means to this end, but that conformance to guidelines is not itself the
 end.
