<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Special Notice: Flexible Working in the Public Sector- An E-Government Bulletin Seminar
- 31 January 2006, Central London
<a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/flexible/">http://www.headstar-events.com/flexible/</a>
 .</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 Flexible working is a vital topic for the public sector. A recent Office
 of Government Commerce report found that: "Flexibility has become
 the byword. The need for efficiency gains [has] led to new approaches
 . . . people, information and communication technology and workspace
 need to complement each other so overall flexibility can be achieved."
</p>
<p> 
 The authors of this report, Professor Virginia Gibson and Rachael
 Luck, are our keynote speakers, joining a strong line-up of case studies
 and expert analysis and advice. Places cost 295 pounds plus VAT for
 public sector and 395 for private sector delegates. See:

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section One: News.</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="i73-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Us State To Mandate Open Source Despite Access Fears.</h3>
<p> 
 The government of the US state of Massachusetts is pushing through a
 controversial plan to publish all its official documents in open source
 formats from January 2007, despite protests that this will make
 information inaccessible to citizens with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The plan, unveiled in September 2005, will require electronic records
 such as text files, spreadsheets and graphical documents to be
 published in the OpenDocument format developed by an international
 consortium called OASIS
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass1</a>
 ), rather than mainstream proprietary formats such as Microsoft Word.
 Massachusetts will become the first state to mandate open standards.
</p>
<p> 
 The plan caused controversy because most screen-reader vendors have
 focused their efforts on developing products that are compatible with
 widely used products, rather than those built on open standards.
 Campaign groups such as the Disability Policy Consortium have
 warned that users of screen-readers will find it more difficult to work
 for the State, or to do business with it
 ( <a href="http://www.dpc-ma.org/opensource/positionstatement.html">http://www.dpc-ma.org/opensource/positionstatement.html</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 However despite the protests, Massachusetts acting chief information
 officer Bethan Pepoli told E-Access Bulletin this week the state would
 be pressing ahead with its plans. "There is a need to save documents in
 a manner that enables the viewing of these documents without the
 reliance of a specific technology," Pepoli said. "We should not have to
 pay for a proprietary solution and maintain upgrades so that documents
 can be viewed."
</p>
<p> 
 However the plan will take the needs of assistive technology users into
 account, Pepoli said "We are working with the vendor community to
 ensure that the appropriate modifications are made to meet these
 needs. We are also working with the community of persons with
 disabilities to ensure that we understand all of their needs, develop the
 appropriate testing process and ensure that this becomes a standard
 business practice," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile the OASIS consortium behind the OpenDocument standard
 has set up an accessibility sub-committee to review the accessibility of
 the standard, although this group has yet to meet or carry out any work
 (see <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mass2</a>
 ).</p>
<h3 id="i73-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: 'Talking Bus Stops' Go Live In Scotland.</h3>
<p> 
 Trials of a pioneering new system providing spoken information at bus
 stops about bus arrival times have gone live this month in Scotland.
</p>
<p> 
 The three-month pilot will allow vision-impaired bus passengers to use
 Brailled buttons to listen to information from the Intelligent Bus
 Information System (IBIS -
 <a href="http://www.spt.co.uk/bus/ibis.html">http://www.spt.co.uk/bus/ibis.html</a>
 ). The units have been installed at 12 bus stops across the Strathclyde region, having received funding
 from the Scottish Executive.
</p>
<p> 
 Bus times are updated from the headquarters of Strathclyde Passenger
 Transport (STP -
 <a href="http://www.spt.co.uk/">http://www.spt.co.uk/</a>
 ), the organisation behind the scheme, and sent to units using wireless
 technology - General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) - and mobile
 phone technology from UK transport information provider Tandata. It
 is thought to be the first time that GPRS technology has been used in
 this way. However, although audio information can be accessed on the
 next five buses due at each stop, complete bus timetables are only
 available on-screen for sighted passengers.
</p>
<p> 
 STP information and support officer Lindsay Mathie told E-Access
 Bulletin there was plenty of scope to develop the new system. "This is
 a base system and lots can be added. It's not the end product, we want
 people's feedback. We see the costs and the units getting smaller," she
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, Mathie said STP may install hardware in the units that would
 allow passengers carrying a receptive fob that, on connection with a
 unit, would provide audible directions to IBIS bus stops.
</p>
<p> 
 In tandem with the project, directions to each of the bus stops from key
 locations have been published on the location description service
 Describe Online
 ( <a href="http://www.describe-online.com/glasgow/ibis/index.html">http://www.describe-online.com/glasgow/ibis/index.html</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 A similar scheme using special handheld devices to trigger spoken bus
 information is already being used at 70 bus-stops in Bristol. See
 'Tickets Please', E-Access Bulletin issue 67, July 2005:
 <a href="http://www.e-accessibility.com/archive.html">http://www.e-accessibility.com/archive.html</a>
 .</p>
<h3 id="i73-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Situation 'Critical' For Talking Newspaper Service.</h3>
<p> 
 The financial position of Talking Newspapers UK, the UK's main
 talking newspaper service for the blind, is now "critical," according to
 the charity's chief executive.
</p>
<p> 
 TNAUK
 ( <a href="http://www.tnauk.org.uk/">http://www.tnauk.org.uk/</a>
 ), which records newspapers and magazines onto accessible formats for
 people with vision and motor impairments, including CD, DAISY,
 audio tape and email needs 200,000 pounds to continue its work
 through the year.
</p>
<p> 
 The organisation's chief executive Tim McDonald said mass public
 donation to the Asian Tsunami disaster last year had drained away 20
 per cent of TNAUK's income. "The situation could become very
 precarious if the decline in income continues," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 TNAUK currently has 9,000 subscribers who pay rates in six bands
 ranging from 24 to 96 pounds a year depending on the number of
 publications received. "We can't charge more because it prices people
 out and the last thing we want is to exclude people that can't afford it,"
 McDonald said.
</p>
<p> 
 TNAUK produces weekly spoken digests of most national newspapers
 as well as specialist magazines including Classic Buses and Astronomy
 Now. However, the organisation will be forced to drop some titles due
 to the lack of funding, McDonald said.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, McDonald said TNAUK wants to produce more electronic
 publications, particularly for mobile devices such as mp3 players. "We
 can go further but we are stymied by spending too much effort keeping
 things going."
</p>
<h3 id="i73-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Mobile Software Makes Emails And Word Documents Speak.</h3>
<p> 
 Downloadable software that can read emails and Word documents
 aloud from mobile devices has been launched by the Irish company
 Magnetic Time
 ( <a href="http://www.magnetictime.com/">http://www.magnetictime.com/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The 'MT1' - which has not been developed specifically for vision-
 impaired users - can be installed onto Personal Digital Assistants
 (PDAs), some mobile phones and mp3 players, at a cost of 23 pounds.
 It is compatible with email programmes Outlook and Outlook Express
 and operating systems Windows 2000 and Windows XP. However,
 while it can read emails aloud, including 'from,' 'to' and 'subject'
 lines, it is unable to read symbols or web addresses.
</p>
<p> 
 The company is set to release a version of MT1 compatible with Apple
 Macintosh computers, the 'MT Mac' and will translate the tool into
 several languages including French, Belgium Dutch and Swedish.

<p>  Roy Drever who works in IT for the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs writes to ask
 whether readers know of a database of "talking" gadgets. "I read in the
 RNIB's 'Shop window Christmas guide,' November 2005, an article
 called 'The 10 best talking gadgets,' [taken] from the Independent
 newspaper.
</p>
<p> 
 "The list did include two Cobolt products
 (<a href="http://www.cobolt.co.uk">http://www.cobolt.co.uk</a>
) but I am certain there are more than 10 talking consumer gadgets out
 there apart from those sold by the RNIB and Cobolt. Does anyone
 know of a maintained database containing a list of all talking gadgets?
 'Talking' should not be the only criteria as there are gadgets that are
 moderately accessible owing to 'beep' feedback, for example the
 Panasonic SD253 bread maker.
</p>
<p> 
 "Such a database could be useful in persuading manufacturers of the
 competitive and ergonomic advantages of enhanced accessibility in
 product design. Even when manufacturers have included enhanced
 accessibility they fail to promote it effectively in their marketing
 strategy."

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Three - Focus- Audio Description in Sport.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: A Level Playing Field?By Carli Hawes.
</h3>
<p> 
 "Part of going to a football game is coming out and being able to
 debate what you've just seen."
</p>
<p> 
 Most sports fans would view this statement - from an Arsenal fan - as
 unremarkable. But for people with impaired sight - and this fan also
 happens to be blind - understanding a live event to the extent of being
 able to discuss it later is a pleasure they are often denied.
</p>
<p> 
 At many sports grounds this is beginning to change with the
 introduction of audio description technology - portable high frequency
 radio receiver packs which link to a live, specially-broadcast
 commentary. The receivers are issued on request to people with sight
 problems to allow them to follow the action as it unfolds. These small,
 lightweight packs can be clipped to a belt, and users can bring their
 own headphones.
</p>
<p> 
 In autumn 2005 the RNIB launched a pilot project called 'Soccer Sight'
 which aims to improve audio description services at sporting events by
 providing seven football league clubs - Brighton and Hove Albion,
 Bristol City, Cardiff City, Doncaster Rovers, Halifax Town,
 Huddersfield Town and Swansea City - with up-to-date audio
 description technology and training for new and existing
 commentators.
</p>
<p> 
 "Soccer Sight is looking at access in its broadest sense," RNIB
 Recreation Manager Eleanor Ellison told E-Access Bulletin. "We are
 working with clubs to look at ticketing, access for guide dogs,
 improvement of signage and audio programmes as well as playing
 opportunities for young blind people."
</p>
<p> 
 According to the BBC Radio Four programme 'In Touch', around 60
 per cent of the 134 league football clubs in the UK provide some kind
 of audio description services to their vision-impaired fans, although
 this can range from specialist modern systems to simply
 recommending a local radio service. The Soccer Sight project aims to
 raise the standard of audio description nationwide to the highest
 possible level.
</p>
<p> 
 The system used in the RNIB pilots is called Radio Audio Description
 (RAD), manufactured by Access Audio
 (<a href="http://www.accessaudio.co.uk">http://www.accessaudio.co.uk</a>
). The company's managing director Douglas Telford says good audio
 commentary is like "painting a picture with words." However he says
 many venues fail to offer a proper service by trying to adapt other
 technologies to broadcast the commentary.
</p>
<p> 
 "They are normally adapted from other uses such as tour guide
 systems, and not designed specifically for audio description," he says.
 "Systems like these have been known to fail in bad weather, and
 infrared audio systems are redundant if the signal becomes blocked by
 anything from a waving banner to a pillar."
</p>
<p> 
 Sports venues are often helped in their accessibility work by relevant
 supporters groups such as the National Association of Disabled
 Supporters
 (NADS - <a href="http://www.nads.org.uk">http://www.nads.org.uk</a>
) and the Visually Impaired Supporters Association (VISA).
</p>
<p> 
 Wayne Busbridge of VISA - the blind fan whose statement opens this
 article - says where clubs take appropriate action, they can transform
 the experience of blind supporters. However, blind supporters need to
 enjoy the same opportunities as everyone else, he says, and if it is
 denied them they may be forced to look at the options for legal action.
</p>
<p> 
 "[Audio description] gives me the same opportunities and information
 as the other fans," Busbridge says. "But clubs have a duty to provide a
 service to everywhere in the stadium. If the quality of audio services
 does not improve it will get to the stage where disabled supporters will
 be left with no choice but to sue individual clubs and sporting
 associations on violations of the Disability Discrimination Act."
</p>
<p> 
 One potential barrier to progress is that clubs tend to think of
 themselves as individual businesses, rather than a collective group, and
 sporting associations such as the world soccer body FIFA and the
 European body UEFA appear not to be taking a strong lead in this
 field. "At present we have very little contact with these organisations",
 says Access Audio's Douglas Telford. "Their attitude seems to be that
 we should contact the clubs directly."
</p>
<p> 
 The situation does seem set to improve in the next few years, however,
 with some high-profile projects in development. The new Wembley
 stadium, due to open this year, will provide 100 per cent wireless audio
 coverage for disabled fans, and the RNIB is campaigning for audio
 description to be installed at all venues for the 2012 Olympics in
 London.
</p>
<p> 
 Other sports are looking to follow suit. Sussex County Cricket Club
 already offers audio description from Access Audio and the RNIB are
 in talks with Middlesex Cricket Club and Surrey Cricket Club to
 provide a full audio service at their Oval and Lords grounds. A few
 rugby clubs are also introducing audio description: in rugby union,
 Cardiff recommends local radio commentary while in rugby league,
 Wakefield Wildcats and Wigan Warriors are cited by the RNIB as
 providing some form of audio assistance.
</p>
<p> 
 And it is not just the live match, but the attendant paraphernalia of
 sports fandom that is gradually being made accessible to all. Arsenal
 Football Club is already using E-Com Communications
 (<a href="http://www.e-comcommunications.co.uk">http://www.e-comcommunications.co.uk</a>
) to create audio CD versions of its matchday programmes, those
 treasured lifelong souvenirs for the dedicated fan. E-Com is now in
 discussion with the All England Tennis Club about providing the same
 service for Wimbledon programmes.
</p>
<p> 
 In future, technologies such as these could allow blind sports fans to
 feel the same buzz as everyone else: the feeling of being part of a
 vibrant live atmosphere without being hampered by delays in
 understanding what is happening on the field of play.

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Four - Techshare Conference Report- Multiple Disability Services.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>13: Stimulation And Responseby Derek Parkinson.
</h3>
<p> 
 In many cases of impaired vision, the nature and extent of the problem
 can be identified in a fairly straightforward matter, for example
 through tests by an ophthalmologist. But when the person is a young
 child with multiple disabilities, it is not such a simple matter, delegates
 heard at November's Techshare 2005 conference hosted by the RNIB
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/mdvi1">http://fastlink.headstar.com/mdvi1</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 Many tests for vision problems assume that the patient has basic
 communication skills, or at least responds to stimuli in a way that helps
 medical professionals arrive at a diagnosis. But for a significant
 proportion of cases of children with multiple disabilities, neither of
 these assumptions can be made, Kay Wrench of Oldham Local
 Education Authority told delegates.
</p>
<p> 
 This can create difficulties when trying to distinguish between children
 who receive little or no visual information, and those that have
 problems understanding it. "There can be vision impairment due to a
 problem with the eyes, or cerebral vision impairment, where the eyes
 are functioning properly, but there is a problem with interpreting visual
 information," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 In Wrench's experience computer-based teaching aids can help
 distinguish between these two types of problem, and help develop a
 child's visual and motor skills where cerebral impairment is a factor.
 Typically, teaching aids will include line drawings of different shapes
 and objects, often highly coloured, and sometimes accompanied by
 another stimulus, such as a sound. "We tend to work with extreme
 stimuli: strong contrasts between light and dark, bright colours. Effects
 like flashing and glittering can work well too," said Wrench.
</p>
<p> 
 Initially, the teacher simply aims to produce a response from the child.
 "You look for a change in behaviour. It could be as simple as the child
 lifting its head up. By experimenting with the stimulation you can try
 to find things that they enjoy," said Wrench. If this is successful, there
 are opportunities to experiment with recognition of two-dimensional
 shapes. "We've had a lot of success with simple things like black and
 white line drawings," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Further along, these materials can be used in animations, simple stories
 and games. Such graphics can also be printed out on stickers and cards
 for offline activities, reinforcing what is learned through a personal
 computer (PC), she said. "Refining visual skills can be extremely
 valuable. A child may struggle to interpret all the detail in an image or
 object, but can still learn to respond to the presence or absence of
 something," she said.
</p>
<p> 
 As well as supporting offline activities, computer graphics can be used
 to teach a child how to interact with PCs in a simple way. Often this
 requires a large, easy-to-use switch, or a tracker ball or roller ball as an
 input device. A child can be taught how to use these by introducing
 them to simple games and scenarios that prompt them to intervene at
 some point, with the possibility of gaining a reward.
</p>
<p> 
 A particular strength of computer-based aids is that they don't become
 weary of repetition, said Wrench. "A computer can give a child a
 reward for an activity that would be quite tedious for a teacher to
 reproduce," she said. The combination of simple inputs, strong stimuli
 and tireless repetition make PCs a very useful teaching aid, she said.
 "Kids will do things with PCs that they won't do any other way."
