Section One: News.

</p>
<h3 id="i84-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Windows 'Vista' Offers Enhanced Accessibility.</h3>
<p> 
 The new version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, 'Vista',
 offers enhanced access features including an improved screen
 magnifier, a basic screen reader and the capability to allow users to
 customise settings according to their needs.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Ease of access center'
 ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/eoa.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsvista/eoa.aspx</a>
 ), contains a set of 'recommended settings,' pages whose function it is to
 assess the level of the user's disability and make appropriate changes
</p>
<p> 
 Users are asked to tick boxes next to statements such as: 'I am blind,'
 'Lighting conditions make it difficult to see a monitor' or 'Images and
 text on a TV are hard to see' in short questionnaires grouped by
 impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'center' is available from the desktop, in a move to make access
 features easier to discover, Director of the Accessible Technology
 Group, Rob Sinclair told E-Access Bulletin at a Vista accessibility
 briefing in Brussels last week. User feedback revealed many users
 simply did not know access features existed in the previous version of
 the operating system.
</p>
<p> 
 The software giant has also shed the wheelchair logo that was
 previously used to open accessibility features available in the 'control
 panel' menu of its predecessor Windows XP. According to Sinclair,
 not everybody identified themselves with the symbol; particularly
 those with a temporary disability.
</p>
<p> 
 Improvements have also been made to the system's screen magnifier
 which now enlarges on-screen content by up to 16 times; and to
 Narrator, a basic screen reader with a new natural-sounding speech
 engine called Anna. The team aims to further improve these features
 said Sinclair.
</p>
<p> 
 The Vista operating system was launched to businesses last week and
 released on the retail market at the end of January 2007.
</p>
<h3 id="i84-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: E-Petition For Accessible Websites On Prime Minister'S Site.</h3>
<p> 
 An e-petition has gone live on the '10 Downing Street,' the British
 Prime Minister's website aiming to persuade Tony Blair to ensure
 government complies with basic web accessibility requirements from
 when they are launched.
</p>
<p> 
 One of 892 e-petitions
 ( <a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/govaccessibility/">http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/govaccessibility/</a>
 ), it reads: "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to ensure that
 any website launched by the government complies with accessibility
 standards (WCAG AA at least)."
</p>
<p> 
 The open petitions initiative, which went live last month, from non-
 profit e-democracy organisation MySociety, allows the British public
 to start and sign any petition on a range of topics online.
</p>
<p> 
 The petitioner, web designer and member of the Guild of Accessible
 Web Designers (GAWDS) Ian Fenn published the plea after
 discovering the website of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
 failed to meet basic accessibility standards despite the department's
 claims that it reached level AAA according to the Web Accessibility
 Initiative's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, following a 200,000
 pound re-vamp last June.
</p>
<p> 
 The last attempt by Clackmannanshire Council web manager Dan
 Champion and Web Standards Project's Accessibility Task Force
 member Bruce Lawson to gain information from the DTI using
 Freedom of Information Law on why the lack of accessibility remained
 was refused on the grounds that it would take too long and cost too
 much money to answer, Champion told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "However, the new site was launched failing even basic accessibility
 guidelines, hence failing to meet the DTI's own standards and
 requirements as specified in official documentation," said Jon Gibbins
 of Fifth November web design
</p>
<p> 
 A DTI spokesperson said the website reaches AAA level of WCAG for
 its templates and checking and improving accessibility was an ongoing
 process. The petition deadline is 21 February 2007.
</p>
<p> 
 The plea has so far been signed by 198 people at the time of writing,
 whose names can be viewed online - meaning it has received less
 signatures than a petition for the Prime Minister to stand on his head
 and juggle ice-cream.
</p>
<h3 id="i84-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Bbc Iplayer Team To Begin User Testing.</h3>
<p> 
 A prototype of the 'iPlayer', a new online multimedia content player
 developed by the BBC, is to be tested next month by 100 people with
 disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The iPlayer will allow UK viewers and listeners to stream audio and
 video content over the internet including all TV programmes broadcast
 on BBC TV - and later BBC radio programmes,  for up to seven days
 after an initial broadcast. The service will include audio description
 where it is already included in programmes
</p>
<p> 
 The iPlayer project, which began in 2003, includes the 'display settings
 project' that develops the ability to customise content such as fonts
 size, adjust on-screen colour contrast, the spacing between letters and
 words and the ability to make content linear for ease of navigation by
 screen reader users.
</p>
<p> 
 Gareth Ford Williams, Senior Content Producer, Accessibility at BBC
 New Media said the iPlayer could create a template for a "completely
 accessible interface" that could be applied to other BBC online features
 and websites. "The long term plan is to get it site-wide," said Ford
 Williams. "You could log on from any PC and the settings will migrate
 with you."
</p>
<p> 
 Before the external user group begins testing the service, BBC staff
 with a vision impairment are also set to test the iPlayer and provide the
 development team with feedback. In future, Ford Williams said the
 BBC New Media accessibility team will also weave in feedback from
 users via the BBC's Web 2.0 blog and through the existing user
 groups.
</p>
<p> 
 "Access is being built in from the bottom up," says Paul Crichton,
 director of web analytics consultants net-progress
 ( <a href="http://www.net-progress.co.uk/">http://www.net-progress.co.uk/</a>
 ) and author of the BBC's Web 2.0 blog. "The plan at this stage is to
 make it completely malleable. The degree of customisation sounds
 exciting. So if you missed the audio description version of Torchwood
 on BBC2 this week, log on to the iPlayer site and eventually you'll be
 able to watch it, audio description and all," said Crichton.
 The iPlayer will be released in April 2007, although Ford Williams
 said "In the first two years it will go through many releases. What we
 put out in the first release is not the finished article."

<p>  Roger Wilson-Hinds writes in response to a feature by Kevin Carey 'All Change!' published in our September
 issue, on the UK government's technology grant scheme Access To
 Work.
</p>
<p> 
 "I don't know whether Kevin Carey is unlucky, too patient in putting
 up with shoddy stuff, or typical of users. The equipment I use is great. I
 have an ET embosser which is like a workhorse. My low cost software
 LookOUT and more recently Thunder, crashes perhaps once or twice a
 month and even then I don't know whether it's the computer itself,
 other software or the screen reader at fault.
</p>
<p> 
 "I have been self-employed since 1992 and am delighted to be able to
 say that for the past four years I have earned enough to purchase my
 own equipment which is a great source of personal satisfaction and
 achievement.
</p>
<p> 
 "As far as unemployed people are concerned, I have become
 evangelical in promoting the freeware model: there should be and is a
 screen reader which is free for home personal use and chargeable to
 organisations on an annual subscription basis. Much better this way, I
 think, than hoping for cooperation from the charities, government and
 access suppliers.
</p>
<p> 
 "My experience is that there is good technology about and sometimes
 this is overpriced and oversold. Access To Work is highly desirable,
 but the very existence of such a subsidy only pushes the prices higher,
 leaving unemployed, unfunded or inarticulate people further behind
 and unable to pay.

<p>  Julie Howell Technical Author, PAS 78 and Director of Public Relations at Fortune Cookie web designers
 ( <a href="http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk">http://www.fortunecookie.co.uk</a>
 ) writes in response to a story in the last issue, 'Public Sector Needs
 Better Guidance On Web Accessibility'.
</p>
<p> 
 "The piece makes no mention of key guidance that was published early
 in 2006," writes Julie. "I am referring to Publicly Available
 Specification 78: Guide to Good practice in Commissioning Accessible
 Websites (PAS 78), commissioned by the Disability Rights
 Commission and published by the British Standards Institution. RNIB
 was the Technical Author and the document was redrafted by a
 steering group that included: Abilitynet, the Cabinet Office, IBM,
 Tesco.com, University College London and the Usability Professionals
 Association. It was then reviewed by 120 industry experts and
 interested parties including representatives from Adobe, the Web
 Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and disabled people ourselves.
</p>
<p> 
 "PAS 78 contains detailed guidance on the process for developing
 accessible websites, and includes information on the role of automated
 testing tools, WAI guidelines and other web standards, and advice on
 when and how to involve disabled people in user testing your website.
 It is available free from:
 <a href="http://www.drc-gb.org/pas">http://www.drc-gb.org/pas</a>
 .</p>
<p> 
 "I hope that everyone who cares about the inclusion of disabled people
 in public life will read PAS 78 and recommend it to everyone in the
 public sector who has responsibility for government websites. It would
 be tragic to overlook this document - the DRC invested public money
 in its production and I truly believe that it contains much valuable
 information that complements the WAI guidelines."

<h3 id="i84-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Training Tips:</h3>
<p>  Jonathan White from Crewe in Cheshire, UK writes in response to a note from Claire Cheskin in the last bulletin on
 her difficulty accessing European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL)
 training materials. "Royal National College for the Blind have
 produced training materials for ECDL, plus other courses, for use with
 Jaws version 7.1 and Supernova version 7.0," he says.
</p>
<p> 
 Julia Cosgrove adds: "I worked for the National Health Service and,
 four years ago, it was suggested I should do one of the college courses.
 Instead of doing this on my own, they referred me to North Tyneside
 College where, they have facilities for those who use screen readers,
 large print, etc.
</p>
<p> 
 In class, you are provided with your own personal assistant who reads
 you the questions. If you get stuck, the tutor is asked to help and the IT
 people there were helpful. As well as the ones in the normal help files
 of Word and Excel, JAWS also has its own range of keyboard
 shortcuts which can be found in help files. It has been three years since
 I did the course and I rather think Jaws will have improved quite a lot.
</p>
<p> 
 "I did all the modules within the year as we were tested after each
 module and this was placed in a book which was sent to the examining
 board at the end of the year. Powerpoint was, of course, the most
 difficult but my personal assistant and class tutor were very helpful and
 they even let me have extra lessons before the end of the summer term.
</p>
<p> 
 "I would advise Claire Cheskin to ask her employers to get in touch
 with a local college and see if they have the right facilities for her.
 Also, she should make sure they have an up-to-date version of JAWS."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: 'Vista' Changes The Image Of Accessibility.By Mel Poluck
</h3>
<p> 
 'Vista', the new version of Microsoft Windows available to businesses
 from last week and released to the public at the end of January,
 includes a range of new accessibility features. And interestingly, two
 of the most noticeable differences in its accessibility offerings
 compared with Windows XP are simple changes in terminology and
 imagery.
</p>
<p> 
 Microsoft's accessibility team has eliminated a couple of accessibility
 stalwarts: the old wheelchair symbol usually found in the 'control
 panel' option under settings' in the 'start' menu and the well-
 established term 'accessibility' has been ditched altogether.
</p>
<p> 
 "People had to click on a wheelchair. People don't identify with that,"
 Rob Sinclair, Director of the Accessibility Team at Microsoft, told E-
 Access Bulletin. So unobvious were the access were access features in
 XP that, worryingly, when Sinclair demonstrated them, "people got
 excited because they think they're brand new," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In its place, there is a set of short questionnaires allowing users to "let
 the system know" about their personal access needs, enabling the
 system to tailor its interfaces accordingly. The 'Ease of access center'
 has a set of 'recommended settings,' pages whose function it is to
 assess the level of the user's disability and make appropriate changes.
</p>
<p> 
 The first set of questions relates to vision impairment and asks user to
 tick boxes next statements like: 'I am blind,' 'Lighting conditions
 make it difficult to see a monitor' and 'Images and text on a TV are
 hard to see.' Other question pages relate to cognitive, hearing, and
 mobility impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 "I'm curious because it's our first attempt at asking questions of the
 customer and recommending settings." But he is cautious not to give
 the impression this is the be-all and end-all of the operating system's
 accessibility. "We see this first 'Ease of access center' as a baby step,"
 said Sinclair.
</p>
<p> 
 Importantly, this feature is available from the desktop, so users may
 now find themselves more easily stumbling upon accessibility features
 whether they want to or not. And, juxtaposed against the previous
 situation, this becomes an important point, because according to
 Sinclair, based on customer feedback on previous Windows versions,
 XP and 2003, users often simply did not know accessibility features
 existed. Consequently, while the software giant's marketing team has
 decided to shed one piece of terminology, accessibility, they have
 coined a new one to help drive their strategy: 'discoverability.'
</p>
<p> 
 The 'Ease of access centre' is also the gateway to a set of new access
 features including a speech recognition feature, carried over from its
 predecessor XP, 'Narrator.' The screen reader has an updated, natural-
 sounding voice, 'Anna,' designed to read Vista operating system
 screen content only. Sinclair said this could not yet replace added-on
 assistive software. "We've focused on building a foundation," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 For the first time in its history, Microsoft invited the collaboration of
 assistive technology vendors during the development phase, which
 lasted around five years. Last February for example, some 25 assistive
 technology vendors including Freedom Scientific, Dolphin and GW
 Micro, came to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond where they wrote
 code alongside staff allowing the smaller companies to build
 compatible products. "Many left with a product running on Vista," said
 Sinclair. In turn, this allowed Vista accessibility developers to garner
 valuable feedback about the operating system. "We sent them a
 preliminary version of Vista and they built their product on that. In the
 past we'd ship Windows then assistive technology vendors would
 spend time getting their products ready," said Sinclair.
</p>
<p> 
 Another change is improvements to the built-in screen magnifier with
 the capacity to enlarge text to 16 times its original size. "The way the
 screen reader draws the screen is completely reinvented for Vista. It
 offers high quality magnification without jagged edges," he said. "It
 was harder than we imagined."
</p>
<p> 
 He added that with more time and people the team could have further
 improved the magnifier, but Sinclair doesn't see the development
 phase as over yet. "The infrastructure is in place to do more interesting
 things," Sinclair told E-Access Bulletin. "We still have a long way to
 go. Vista is the first step down a new path."

 will be: 100 million blogs and the number is said to be doubling every
 six months; 120 million YouTube downloads per day; and 130 million
 members of MySpace.
</p>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, back in the world where the one-eyed man is king, we are
 still wringing our hands or sitting on the edge of our seats in
 anticipation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 I can understand why we have concentrated on accessing and
 processing data but as far back as the writer and futurist Alvin Toffler's
 book The Third Wave of 1980, it was clear that to consume would
 never be enough; that to survive we had to become both producers and
 consumers - "Prosumers" he called them.
</p>
<p> 
 The nostrum of Mr Micawber, the Charles Dickens' character from
 David Copperfield - "Annual income twenty pounds, annual
 expenditure 19 pounds 19 and six, result happiness. Annual income 20
 pounds, annual expenditure 20 pounds ought and six, result misery' -
 was not peculiar to the Victorians, nor even to the analogue age!
</p>
<p> 
 In addition to the economics of creativity over consumption, there is
 the dimension of pleasure; it is rewarding to be able to contribute.
</p>
<p> 
 So what is the sector supposed to do? First, recognise the problem.
 Both employees and those who are too old to work - the majority of
 vision impaired people - need a balance between consumption and
 production. A symptom of our problem is the time it has taken for any
 consciousness in the sector of the importance first of television and
 then, more recently, of games. The message here is that production is a
 key concept in the unfolding of the 'Information age'.
</p>
<p> 
 Secondly, this initiative to create authoring tools cannot be left to the
 third sector, academia, business or government alone. We need:
 government commitment to creativity in general and that of disabled
 people in particular; academic interest in solution-based, closed-ended
 research; business interest in solutions which benefit our sector but
 have wider commercial possibilities; and voluntary sector leadership
 and seed capital.
</p>
<p> 
 Thirdly, the voluntary sector, primarily RNIB, needs to establish a
 major study into the creativity of blind and visually impaired people,
 looking at education, work and leisure in the digital age.
</p>
<p> 
 A survey of the British Journal of Visual Impairment, and the Journal
 of Visual Impairment and Blindness of the American Foundation of the
 Blind, shows how far behind academics are. We know precious little
 about digital creativity in general and know next to nothing about the
 creative processes of blind and visually impaired people in particular.
</p>
<p> 
 The reason why third sector initiative is so important is that business
 and government are primarily concerned with consumption because
 this preserves the top-down model of sales and service delivery. The
 social media have arisen exclusively out of the tie-up between the
 entrepreneurial and third sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 It has to be admitted, however, that the US third sector is more
 independent and flexible than ours, relying as it does on unconditional
 tax-concession fuelled philanthropy rather than on project-funding
 painfully extracted from a grudging public sector.
</p>
<p> 
 Our dependence makes us cautious and so the conjunction of third
 sector and entrepreneurship has been rare. What our third sector needs
 to do is to float off some of its funding into satellite creativity
 ventures.
</p>
<p> 
 The culture of corporate worthiness - all sensible shoes and safe pairs
 of hands - is not conducive to the kind of enterprise which involves
 kids in jeans ordering in pizza at midnight and sleeping next to their
 computers. Postmodern problems need postmodern solutions.
