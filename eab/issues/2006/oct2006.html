<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Sponsored Notice: BT Internet Rangers- How young people can help bridge the digital divide.
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 BT Internet Rangers is an initiative celebrating the role young people
 play in helping their elders get online. The initiative was launched in
 2003 after research revealed nearly a third of parents and grandparents
 had been taught or encouraged to use the internet by a young person.
</p>
<p> 
 The search is on to find the BT Internet Ranger of the year 2006. Open
 to anyone under the age of 16, young people can enter themselves or
 be nominated by someone they've helped.
</p>
<p> 
 There are 11 laptop computers up for grabs - the winner will also win
 a family trip to Cornwall and a VIP tour of the world's fastest internet
 caf&#233; at the BT Satellite Earth Station in Goonhilly.

<h3 id="i82-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Blended Broadband Services Could 'Transform Lives'.</h3>
<p> 
 Access to simultaneous, multi-channel services over the internet is set
 to transform the way disabled people use online services, according to
 a new report launched at the e-Access'06 conference
 ( <a href="http:///www.headstar.com/eaccess06">http:///www.headstar.com/eaccess06</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "Blended transactions" will in future be the "most remarkable
 manifestation of the use of broadband for disabled people," said the
 report's author Kevin Carey at the annual conference on access to
 technologies by people with a disability.
</p>
<p> 
 So-called "blended" or "hybrid" applications have the potential to
 deliver help to the user simultaneously through more than one channel,
 minimizing the barriers that disabilities often present said Carey, who
 is director of digital inclusion charity HumanITy and vice-chair of the
 RNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 For example, if confronted with an online form a user could contact a
 human advisor by activating an on-screen link to call for assistance.
 Using internet telephony based services - or voice over IP (VoIP) - he
 or she could talk to the advisor while filling out an online form, for
 example, and both parties would have access to the form.
</p>
<p> 
 Carey suggested this hybrid model could also combat the social
 exclusion experienced by older and disabled people. "An always-on
 broadband community network" could be used for "virtual
 communities of support" he said, as well as reduce feelings of
 isolation.
</p>
<p> 
 To fund this blended approach to broadband services, the public sector
 should collaborate with charities and the private sector to work out a
 distribution model whereby the public sector would pay a basic
 subscription to a supplier, suggested Carey. "Individuals could then top
 up with special services such as mobile wireless. This would save a
 huge cost in over-engineered hardware, installation, maintenance and
 upgrading," he said.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: For more on this, see Kevin Carey's recently published report
 'Broadband and Disability'
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/bt3">http://fastlink.headstar.com/bt3</a>

 Ability magazine and E-Access Bulletin.

<h3 id="i82-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Us Court Sends Message Of Hope To Blind Americans.</h3>
<p> 
 A landmark ruling in a US federal court has established that US anti-
 discrimination law applies to online services provided by retailers,
 opening the way for vision impaired citizens to take legal action
 against the owners of inaccessible websites.
</p>
<p> 
 At a hearing in California, federal district court Judge Marilyn Hall
 Patel rejected a claim by the retailer Target that anti-discrimination law
 such as Americans with Disability Act (ADA), does not apply to online
 services. The case against Target, which operates 1,300 stores in 47
 states, was filed as a class action lawsuit on behalf of all vision
 impaired citizens unable to access the Target website
 ( <a href="http://fastlink.headstar.com/ada2">http://fastlink.headstar.com/ada2</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "The message that this case sends to blind people in the US is that
 gratuitous technological barriers to their participation in the
 mainstream of American life will not be tolerated," said Daniel
 Goldstein, of Brown, Goldstein and Levy LLP, acting for the National
 Federation of the Blind, and a blind college student Bruce "BJ" Sexton.
</p>
<p> 
 It is alleged that Target's website prevents blind customers from
 browsing and purchasing products online, and accessing corporate
 information such as employment opportunities, investor news, and
 company policies. "The ruling by the court in the Target case is the
 first federal court ruling to hold that a commercial retailer's website is
 subject to the ADA," Goldstein told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 "The significance for other retailers using websites to supplement their
 commercial activity is that they need to make their websites accessible
 to the blind," he said. "The parties will now engage in what is called
 discovery - the securing of information from one's adversary on
 matters relevant to the prosecution and defense of the case," said
 Goldstein.
</p>
<h3 id="i82-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Expert Software Will Analyse User Needs.</h3>
<p> 
 An EU-funded project is underway to develop "intelligent" software
 that automatically learns how a particular user accesses web-based
 services, and offers to adjust the user interface when appropriate.
</p>
<p> 
 The three year DIADEM project, co-ordinated by Brunel University in
 the UK, will see software developed in Norway and Italy and piloted at
 the city councils of Turin in Italy and Sheffield in the UK.
</p>
<p> 
 DIADEM is based on widely used 'expert systems' technology. It will
 monitor input from users, build a profile of the services they are likely
 to need, and offer to adjust the interface according to their preferences.
</p>
<p> 
 "DIADEM will work in the background until the pattern of key strokes
 [or use of the mouse] suggests the user is having difficulties," Tony
 Elliman, project leader at Brunel University, told E-Access Bulletin.
 "By matching the pattern to general information about the task and the
 type of problems that can arise, it will then be able to offer appropriate
 help."
</p>
<p> 
 Assistance could come in the form of completing the information in a
 form's field or "box," rephrasing a question, or modifying the order in
 which questions on the form are answered and speech output may be
 included to assist users with a vision impairment.
</p>
<p> 
 Funded with three million pounds from the EU's e-inclusion project
 ( <a href="http://www.einclusion-eu.org/">http://www.einclusion-eu.org/</a>
 ), other project participants are: the Norwegian National Computer
 Centre, Norsk Regnesentral, an independent, non-profit foundation that
 carries out research and development projects; IT supplier MORE in
 Norway; and state owned IT services for the Piemonte region,
 CSI-Piemonte, in Italy.
</p>
<p> 
 Sheffield will address issues surrounding use of the technology in
 public places such as libraries, while in Oslo, Norway, technology
 company and consultancy Bluegarden will develop its use in the
 workplace, conducting user testing with around 40 employees of the
 national postal service.
</p>
<h3 id="i82-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: All Uk Retail Websites Fail Basic Accessibility Standard.</h3>
<p> 
 The UK's top online shopping sites all fail to meet basic web
 accessibility guidelines, a survey of the top 30 retail websites has
 found.
</p>
<p> 
 According to research by web usability consultancy Nomensa, not one
 of the homepages reviewed reached achieved 'level A' compliance -
 the minimum level of accessibility - according to the World Wide Web
 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). And all
 but one of the 30 websites reviewed used graphical text and 28 sites
 did not provide appropriate text descriptions for images, 'alt tags,' to
 show vision impaired visitors what is on screen.
</p>
<p> 
 Pop-up windows, inaccessible to screen reader and screen magnifier
 users were found on 25 of the websites. And just three of the sites
 surveyed were found to have made an effort to improve the
 accessibility of their websites: John Lewis, Marks and Spencer and
 Tesco.
</p>
<p> 
 The websites under scrutiny included: online book and music shop
 Amazon, mobile phone company Carphone Warehouse, computer
 company Dell, retail giant Marks and Spencer, and supermarket Tesco.
</p>
<p> 
 The study was carried out by web usability company Nomensa, which
 said businesses risk alienating over than 10 million disabled people in
 the UK by designing websites with low accessibility. The report said:
 "Almost without exception, online retailers are not taking web
 accessibility, customer experience or profitability seriously."

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>11: Time To Rock The Boatby Mel Poluck.
</h3>
<p> 
 With a meagre five per cent of books published in the UK available in
 formats accessible to people with vision impairments, it's no wonder
 BBC age and disability correspondent Peter White was in combative
 mood at last month's 'e-Access'06' event, the annual conference
 organised by E-Access Bulletin.
 ( <a href="http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess06/">http://www.headstar-events.com/eaccess06/</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 "We're talking about equality and natural justice that people have the
 same access to information as everyone else," White told the audience.
 "We need to make people understand how important this is: I'm not
 convinced agents, booksellers and publishers have got the message.
 Maybe the time has come for rocking the boat," said White.
</p>
<p> 
 Of the few books accessible to vision-impaired readers, those
 published in electronic formats are much more convenient to carry
 around than printed formats such as Braille, for example. "I thought it
 was going to be impossible, to pluck a book off the shelf and read it
 like other people," said White, describing holidays when he and his
 wife would argue over suitcase space because his Braille books took up
 so much room.
</p>
<p> 
 While there is an ever-expanding range of media on which to listen to
 accessible books - MP3 player; podcast and CD - it remains the case
 that 95 per cent of titles published in the UK are not accessible,
 blocking out a massive chunk of reading material on the market. "We
 need the same choice as everyone else," he said. "[That's] one thing to
 give absolute priority to," White said.
</p>
<p> 
 The decision to develop accessible products or features of products,
 may boil down to the perception of the disability market, White told
 the audience. For example, manufacturers are happy to add text or
 camera facilities to mobile phones and leave it to the consumer
 whether or not they are used, said White. But, as soon as the
 "disability" label is associated with a product or feature at the
 conceptual or market research stage, manufacturers think of this as a
 "minority market" and are put off, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In convincing the manufacturers, publishers and those who ultimately
 decide on of the importance of accessibility, the numbers game is
 crucial, he told delegates. "You need to convince people you're a big
 and powerful lobby." Higher figures give you "political capital," he
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 But there is a fine line to walk between arguing this case and leaving
 manufacturers feeling misled. An example is the accessible talking
 radio from Pure. "[Pure] were disappointed with the results," White
 told delegates. "Take-up was astonishing in terms of numbers but not
 astonishing in terms of numbers you need to make a profit," he said.
 "They felt misled."
</p>
<p> 
 But the answer to the fight for accessibility may lie in manufacturers
 tapping in to the burgeoning proportion of older people in the UK
 population. "The older generation boom" - that's where the market is,"
 White said. Now, technology companies need to be investing in the
 "grey pound," said White.
</p>
<p> 
 So, apart from convincing the private sector of the "natural justice" in
 designing products and services for people with disabilities, now is the
 time to forge alliances with other groups in society. "You need to
 convince people you are a big and powerful lobby," White said. "It's in
 our interest as a community, older people and non-working disabled
 people to get on the digital bandwagon," said White. And in turn this
 could prove to be a sure-fire way to win the "numbers game," he said.

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>12: Better Than A Manual</h3>
<p> 
 A blind, elderly resident of Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council
 (DMBC) in the UK found difficulties with navigating his council's
 website using the JAWS screen reader. The following is the ensuing
 email exchange between the resident, David Bates, and the council
 web team. This extract shows that although accessing public services
 online can be a problem for some users, these problems can be
 overcome with benefits for all members of the community.
</p>
<p> 
 From David Bates, sent 25 July 2006:
</p>
<p> 
 Hi, I spoke to you about blind residents accessing the Dudley website
 with a screen reader. After a few hours I could eventually find most of
 the departments, but this is very laborious as many of the same links
 have to be listened to over and over again on each page. This is
 accentuated by the length and complexity of the site.
</p>
<p> 
 Remember that the blind reader won't know which page he is on
 without keying in the required keystrokes to read out the page title, and
 the similarity of each page beginning is very confusing to listen to, and
 closing an opened page requires several keystrokes to operate the Back
 button.
</p>
<p> 
 Listening to the Home page with up to 117 lines is a tedious task, with
 subsequent links and subject pages repeating the same list - could this
 format perhaps be [made] more logical and simpler to understand? If
 you try out your computer using JAWS, with the monitor turned off,
 I'm sure that you will find this suggested navigation format easier and
 quicker to use.
</p>
<p> 
 From Stuart Orford, Web Developer DMBC, sent July 26, 2006:
</p>
<p> 
 David, thanks for the feedback: it's good to get a real user's perspective
 rather than working from what the various accessibility and usability
 organisations say we should do. I've thought about setting up a quick
 fix that should help in using the site. The idea to use a 'skip navigation'
 or 'header' [link] has been considered before in the past but
 unfortunately not implemented. However, since your email I've had a
 look at our main style template on the test system and put in a few
 tweaks which I'd like to run past you first.
</p>
<p> 
 I've added a 'skip to content' link at the very top of the page which will
 always be the first link on every page of the site. If selected, this link
 would bypass the header area and the navigation menu, linking you to
 the title of the page content itself.
</p>
<p> 
 At the end of the 'contents,' I've added two links. The first one is a
 duplicate of the 'skip to content' which would take you back the start
 of the page content, missing the header and navigation menu. The
 second would be a 'skip to menu' [link] which would drop you at
 the top of the main navigation.

 Hi. Your suggestion for skip links sounds very helpful, also the careful
 wording of such links would be of immense help to less computer
 literate users. I imagine council websites are intended to appeal to a
 wider spectrum of users than almost any other sites, and this
 requirement must make their formatting very difficult.
 Old people like me tend to think of a website as being like a printed
 catalogue, where you look down the contents page, find your subject,
 and turn to the page indicated. Finding that this page is then a copy of
 the one which has just been read is very confusing. A blind user might
 then press the required keystrokes to read out the title of the page, or
 perhaps the 'back' keystroke to close that page and start over again. The
 skip links that you suggest would remove this confusion.
 If the screen controls such as text size have to be at the top of each new
 page, the skip link could land the cursor below these controls to read
 out a duplicate of the page link title. Or the cursor could land on
 [wording such as:] 'the above controls are to help make the screen
 more readable,' immediately above the title line, which could also
 contain the relevant phone number.
 This layout would also make perfect sense to sighted users providing
 that the focus line for the cursor was somewhere on the opening screen
 of the new page.
 As blind users rely on the synthetic voice to read out the screen text
 line by line, and to also speak each key as it is pressed this is much
 slower than for a sighted person, [so] extra links make the task much
 longer. The 'welcome' page took me 7 minutes to listen to and
 contained a selection of screen controls, some difficult to understand.
 Alternatively I could tab through the headings in about 3 minutes and
 miss out some important items such as the council phone number. This
 format is probably very interesting for those surfing the website for
 entertainment, but frustrating for those looking for a specific page.
 Each link could lead to a detailed subject menu which would keep the
 user in their chosen section and moving onwards to their target subject
 with fewer irrelevant links to read on the way.

 David, I've amended the Dudley site to now include the various 'skip
 to links.' The first link on the page is now a 'go to content' which will
 drop you at the page title and ignore all the headers and the menu. At
 the end of the page content there are two links: 'go to menu' and 'go to
 homepage.' The first will take you back the menu and the second
 will reload the Dudley site at the homepage again.
</p>
<p> 
 It's not possible to add another link at the end to jump back to the start
 of the page content. The reason is that I'd have to have the link titled
 'go to content' because of W3C accessibility guidelines
 ( <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>
 ), as we cannot have a links on a web page that go to the same page with
 different link text.
</p>
<p> 
 We have been thinking about the header area and have made a note of
 your suggestions but nothing is decided yet as we need to consult with
 our Marketing team. The menu navigation system is somewhat lengthy
 but was set up based on a national list of service areas. The thought
 behind this was that if all councils adopted it then if you go to another
 local authority site the menu list should be the same and save
 confusion. This will most likely change in the future as further
 guidance is published.
 Finally, David Bates told E-Access Bulletin: "Ideally every website
 designer should have access to a computer with a screen reader, on
 which they should have to demonstrate their website using sound only,
 and with the monitor switched off. The missing picture would be worth
 a thousand words!"

 exchanges with online service providers, please let us know. We may
