<h3 id="i167-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Application Of Eu Accessibility Standard Hits Roadblock</h3>
<p> 
 Application of a new European standard on ICT accessibility is being 
 hampered by delays with an EU directive mandating its use by governments, 
 the standard's developer has told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 The 'European Standard on accessibility requirements suitable for public 
 procurement of ICT products and services in Europe' (EN 301 549) was 
 published in February by ETSI (the European Telecommunications Standards 
 Institute).
</p>
<p> 
 Currently, however, the standard's use is not mandated by EU law, a fact 
 which is likely to delay its take-up for some time, Matthias Schneider of 
 ETSI tells E-Access Bulletin in an exclusive interview published this month 
 (see Section Two, this issue).
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The EU has not yet ruled that the standard has to be used for procurement 
 at European level, and unless a state regulates that the standard has to be 
 applied by public procurers, I wouldn't expect many organisations will 
 switch over to using it&quot;, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2011, the European Commission did announce it was developing a European 
 Accessibility Act covering the accessibility requirements of all goods and 
 services bought and sold in the EU, which would be likely to use the new 
 standard. However despite several false dawns, it has since been delayed 
 again and is unlikely to be drafted before the autumn, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 In a further complication, Schneider said the standard itself might have to 
 be altered later this year to remain consistent with the revision of Section 
 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act, a US law requiring ICT purchased by public 
 bodies to be accessible. EU standards makers and technology companies are 
 keen for the two systems to be aligned to boost international trade, but 
 Section 508 has been undergoing its own review process which is lasting 
 longer than policymakers originally expected.

<h3 id="i167-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Supply Chain Collaboration Key To Accessible E-Books</h3>
<p> 
 People in all parts of the publishing chain - from device manufacturers to 
 those developing content platforms - must work together to improve e-book 
 accessibility, delegates at the London Book Fair heard this month.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;No one player in the chain between author and reader can solve the problem 
 of accessibility on their own . only through collaboration can we achieve 
 our goal of delivering the content in ways and on platforms that suit the 
 needs of particular readers&quot;, Publishers Licensing Society (PLS) chairman 
 Mark Bide told the fair's seminar on accessible e-publishing.
</p>
<p> 
 The seminar is organised by the book industry standards body EDItEUR with 
 the Royal National Institute of Blind People and The Publishers Association.
</p>
<p> 
 Speaking after the seminar, Bide told E-Access Bulletin the debate over 
 e-book accessibility has shifted recently towards the need to ensure 
 mainstream formats are flexible. &quot;We are now increasingly focused on the 
 importance of making mainstream e-books as accessible as possible, although 
 we do not forget that there continues to be a need to facilitate access to 
 specialist formats where no appropriate e-book is accessible&quot;, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;As with any other reader, we simply need to deliver the reading experience 
 that [readers] require - whether it be large print, text-to-speech, 
 different text or background colours&quot;, Bide said.

<h3 id="i167-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: E-Book Access Debate Continues In Us Following Legal Waiver</h3>
<p> 
 Meanwhile, the debate over whether all e-book readers should be made 
 accessible - including the addition of sound capabilities - is set to 
 continue in the US, after the country's Federal Communications Commission 
 granted reader manufacturers a temporary waiver to one accessibility 
 regulation.
</p>
<p> 
 The FCC has granted a one-year waiver exempting single-purpose e-book 
 readers from a requirement in the US 21st Century Video and Communications 
 and Video Accessibility Act that equipment used for advanced communication 
 services (ACS) be accessible to people with disabilities ( 
 <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/coalition-e-reader-manufacturers-petition-waiver-acs-rules">http://www.fcc.gov/document/coalition-e-reader-manufacturers-petition-waiver-acs-rules</a>
 )  .
</p>
<p> 
 The move came in response to a petition filed last year by a coalition of 
 e-reader manufacturers -Amazon, Kobo and Sony - who said that because 
 e-readers are used almost exclusively for reading, they do not provide ACS 
 (see <a href="http://bit.ly/16gW53i">http://bit.ly/16gW53i</a>
 ). The firms also argued that to make such  readers fully accessible would increase their cost and weight and decrease 
 battery life, essentially turning them into different devices more similar 
 to tablet computers.
</p>
<p> 
 In granting the waiver, the FCC said: &quot;Although capable of accessing ACS 
 (such as email), we conclude that this narrow class of e-readers is designed 
 primarily for reading text-based digital works, not for ACS.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However, the commission limited the waiver to one year, despite the 
 coalition's request for an indefinite waiver, saying: &quot;given the swift pace 
 at which technologies are evolving and the expanding role of ACS in 
 electronic devices, the waiver will expire on January 28, 2015.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 It also limited the waiver to &quot;a distinct, narrow class of e-readers&quot; with 
 limited features, namely those with no LCD screen; no camera; and no 
 built-in email, instant messaging or similar ACS applications. Most e-book 
 manufacturers already also make more sophisticated, tablet PC-style readers 
 which do comply with accessibility rules, and the new waiver in effect 
 separates these categories of products from each other for legal purposes - 
 for one year, at least.
</p>
<p> 
 Nate Hoffelder, editor of the e-books blog &quot;Digital reader&quot; ( 
 <a href="http://www.the-digital-reader.com">http://www.the-digital-reader.com</a>
 ), told E-Access Bulletin he expected the  waiver to be extended again next year, since its removal would be likely to 
 result in the simpler class of e-book readers being withdrawn from the 
 market.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;By the time the new regulation was written in 2011, Amazon, Kobo... and 
 other device makers all had one or more e-readers on the market which did 
 not have sound, and thus could not comply with the regulation&quot;, Hoffelder 
 said. &quot;That put the device makers in the position of filing for a waiver or 
 simply pulling the e-readers from the market.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 However the American Library Association, which has campaigned against any 
 waiver, said in a statement it was &quot;pleased that e-reader manufacturers must 
 file for a waiver next year and re-argue their case, or make their e-reader 
 ACS features accessible to people with print and other disabilities.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: The Slow Arm Of The Lawby Dan Jellinek.
</h3>
<p> 
 For many years, the disability community in Europe has been pushing the EU 
 to write accessibility into its trade rules for ICT goods and services, not 
 least when it comes to ICT purchased by governments themselves.
</p>
<p> 
 Similar rules have long been in place in the US, perhaps surprisingly for 
 those who like to caricature America as a champion of free trade at any 
 social cost. Now it seems, some progress is being made in Europe. But is it 
 fast enough?
</p>
<p> 
 The 'European Standard on accessibility requirements suitable for public 
 procurement of ICT products and services in Europe' (EN 301 549) was 
 published in February by ETSI (the European Telecommunications Standards 
 Institute - <a href="http://www.etsi.org">http://www.etsi.org</a>
 ) in association with international  groupings of national standards bodies CEN and CENELEC (www.cencenelec.eu). 
 It had previously been known as Mandate 376, through a drawn-out development 
 period of some seven years (see EAB, July 2012 - 
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=753">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=753</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 The standard aims to ensure ICT products and services - including websites, 
 software and digital devices from computers to smartphones and ticketing 
 machines - are made more accessible to people of all abilities, either 
 directly or through compatibility with assistive technologies such as 
 text-to-speech. It is accompanied by three technical reports (TR 101 550, TR 
 101 551 and TR 101 552), adding more detail.
</p>
<p> 
 Currently, however, its use is not mandated either by EU law or national law 
 in any individual country, a fact which is likely to delay its take-up in 
 most parts of Europe for some time, Matthias Schneider, chairman of the ETSI 
 technical committee on human factors, told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The EU has not yet ruled that the standard has to be used for procurement 
 at European level, and unless a state regulates that the standard has to be 
 applied by public procurers, I wouldn't expect many organisations will 
 switch over to using it&quot;, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 In 2011, the European Commission did announce it was developing a European 
 Accessibility Act covering the accessibility requirements of all goods and 
 services bought and sold in the EU, which would be likely to use the new 
 standard. However despite several false dawns - including a promise last 
 year that the act would finally be drafted in the first quarter of 2014 - it 
 has since been delayed again.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;So far it has still not been drafted, and there is no clear insight why the 
 commission has delayed for so long&quot;, Schneider said. &quot;My personal opinion is 
 that it will not appear prior to the instalment of the next European 
 Commission in July or August, so I don't see anything happening before 
 October.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 As and when an accessibility act is passed it will cover both public and 
 private sector procurement, and it will then be possible for member states 
 to apply the new accessibility standard across all sectors, after a late 
 change to it at the urging of the European Commission, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The original purpose of the standard was very clearly public procurement, 
 but during its development the commission realised it could be used for many 
 more purposes&quot;, he said. &quot;The problem was, to change its purpose halfway 
 through development would have meant asking new groups of interested parties 
 to comment, which was no longer possible. So in the end, we came up with 
 something which didn't go all the way to what the commission wanted but 
 still could also be used in other tasks such as in the private sector, 
 provided someone mandates it.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The compromise reached can be seen in a small but key change in the standard's 
 title, from the previous 'Accessibility requirements for public procurement' 
 to the final 'Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement', 
 with the new wording leaving its use open in other fields, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 In a bizarre quirk of the European standards system - that could cause 
 unnecessary expense to the unwary - the new European Standard EN 301 549 is 
 available free of charge from the ETSI website but costs a significant fee 
 to buy from some national standards bodies. The latter group includes the 
 British Standards Institution (BSI), which is charging members &pound;134 and 
 non-members &pound;264 to buy the same standard (its website does not specify how 
 much it charges for membership, which depends on how many standards an 
 organisation uses).
</p>
<p> 
 It is usual for all national European standards bodies to publish their own 
 copies of European standards, numbered within their own systems - the new 
 standard is published by BSI as BS EN 301549:2014. However because different 
 standards bodies have different business models, some charge for their 
 products, while others do not. ETSI, funded by more than 700 members 
 worldwide including technology companies, does not charge for its standards.
</p>
<p> 
 The situation is made even stranger by the fact that the British and other 
 national 'versions' of a standard such as this one do not differ in any way 
 from the pan-European version, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It might have a different cover page, but the content is identical because 
 they cannot change it. It is one of the puzzles that the European standards 
 situation creates every once in a while.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The new standard does not create its own technical specifications from 
 scratch in most areas, since this groundwork has already been carried out 
 for existing hardware and software standards in Europe, the US and 
 elsewhere, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 For example there are already standards specifying the range over which 
 speech volume should be adjustable; and for web accessibility the new 
 standard refers to level 'AA' of WCAG 2.0, the web content accessibility 
 guidelines produced by the international World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
</p>
<p> 
 Likewise for software that runs on desktop computers or other devices and 
 for documents, the requirements are harmonised with work by the W3C's 
 WCAG2ICT Task Force (<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag2ict">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag2ict</a>
). This means that  the requirements for the web, documents and software all follow the same 
 principles.
</p>
<p> 
 The work on this standard is seen as crucial for global trade and so ETSI 
 and its partners have worked hard to ensure the accessibility requirements 
 contained in the new standard are consistent with the revision of Section 
 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act, a US law requiring ICT purchased by public 
 bodies to be accessible, Schneider said.
</p>
<p> 
 However, this work has been complicated by the fact that Section 508 has 
 been undergoing its own review process which is lasting longer than 
 policymakers originally expected, he said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We have tried to synchronise with the newest version of Section 508, but 
 unfortunately the newest version is not finalised, so we don't know what its 
 contents will be yet. It could be that in half a year from now, when the US 
 comes out with the newest version of Section 508, we might have to change 
 ours again so it is compatible. We hope that this will not be the case.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Harmonising our approach with US was extremely difficult and very 
 time-consuming, but we want it to be harmonised because international 
 companies such as Nokia, Motorola or Microsoft have no wish to develop 
 products designed for accessibility requirements in Europe which are 
 different to the US.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Progress in some areas is happening a bit faster, however. While Europe 
 continues to wait for a general accessibility directive, one area where the 
 new standard may be put to use more quickly could be public sector websites. 
 There is a proposal to use it as part of accessibility guidelines for a new 
 public sector website accessibility directive already passing through the EU 
 law-making system
 (see E-Access Bulletin, February 2014 - 
 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=986">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=986</a>
).</p>
<p> 
 It would also be possible for European nations to pick up on the new 
 standard individually and embed it in their own policies, Schneider says. 
 &quot;Member states can act individually, so I would expect that some - probably 
 Nordic countries and Germany first - will mandate it in their state 
 procurement rules.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 As well as creating major potential social benefits, European policymakers 
 also hope the standard, and European Directives or state laws mandating its 
 use, will help boost the market for technology companies and companies 
 working in the accessible and assistive technology sectors.
</p>
<p> 
 As Elena Santiago Cid, director general of CEN and CENELEC, said in a 
 statement: &quot;We believe that including accessibility requirements in European 
 standards will deliver both societal and economic benefits, by helping to 
 expand the market for accessible products and services.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 While the workings of European law move slowly, the new standard is the 
 latest piece in a jigsaw puzzle which does seem to be finally coming 
 together.
</p>
<p> 
 Despite the long delay in its development, and the new further wait for a 
 law mandating it to be widely used, the standard's publication - following 
 on from the directive on public sector websites - marks the beginning of a 
 breakthrough.
</p>
<p> 
 In the US, Section 508 law is credited with driving the biggest technology 
 companies including Apple and Microsoft to pay far more attention to the 
 accessibility of their mainstream products. Step by step, Europe seems to be 
 catching up.
