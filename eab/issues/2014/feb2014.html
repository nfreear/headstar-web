<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Bcs To Tackle ‘Unconscious Bias’ Against Disabled Itjob Applicants
</h3>
<p> 
 Training to tackle “unconscious bias” against disabled job
 applicants by recruitment staff at IT firms has been launched
 by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.
</p>
<p> 
 The institute is to receive &pound;18,000 of funding from Royal
 Academy of Engineering to support bias training after signing
 up to the academy’s Engineering Diversity Concordat (
 <a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/diversity/resources/eng_div_con">http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/diversity/resources/eng_div_con</a>

 cordat.htm ). The training is aimed at tackling unconscious bias
 affecting disability, race, sexual orientation, age, obesity and
 gender.
</p>
<p> 
 About 300 BCS specialist group and branch committee
 members will be trained initially by the end of 2015, with the
 intention of ensuring those key individuals spread the learning
 more widely throughout the institute’s membership.
</p>
<p> 
 “We are hard-wired to prefer people who look like us, sound
 like us and share our interests”, Rebecca George, chair of the
 BCS policy and public affairs board, told E-Access Bulletin
 this week.
</p>
<p> 
 “Unconscious biases are simply our natural people preferences
 but this can lead to us making poor decisions, particularly
 around recruitment. It means that we are less likely to recruit
 people who do not look or sound like us, and this can lead to a
 workforce which doesn’t fully represent the demographics of
 society.”
</p>
<p> 
 Examples of action to tackle bias include removing names and
 photos from CVs and training interviewers in guarding against
 unconscious bias, George said.
</p>
<p> 
 “The first step is to help individuals become aware of their
 own unconscious bias which can be done through self-
 assessment”, she said. “Our aim is to raise awareness of
 unconscious bias through research, case studies and
 explanations of what it is, as well explaining the gap between
 explicit and implicit bias.”
</p>
<p> 
 To illustrate the urgency of the IT profession’s need for such
 traning, George quoted diversity analyst Tinu Cornish, a
 psychologist at consultancy Different With Difference, who
 has said: “At the current rate of change it will be 2080 before
 we elect a representative government, 2085 before we close the
 gender pay gap, and probably never before we close the
 disability employment gap”.

<h3 id="i165-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: European Parliament Urges Stronger Public Web Access Law.</h3>
<p> 
 Members of the European Parliament have voted by a huge
 majority to beef up a proposed European Directive on the
 Accessibility of Public Sector Bodies’ Websites.
</p>
<p> 
 This week MEPs backed a move by 593 votes to 40, with 13
 abstentions, to require EU member states to ensure all public
 websites are fully accessible, not just those in 12 categories
 proposed by the European Commission such as social security
 benefits and enrolment in higher education (see bit.ly/1jF3j99
 ).
</p>
<p> 
 The parliament also wants the new rules to apply to websites
 run by private firms performing public tasks, such as energy
 utility companies and companies providing outsourced public
 services such as transport or health care.
</p>
<p> 
 According to the Parliament’s plan, an optional exemption
 would be included in the private sector condition for small
 businesses, however. This would mean companies employing
 up to 12 people could be exempted from the new law if
 member states wish. MEPs have proposed giving member states
 one year to comply with the rules for new content and three
 years for all existing content, with a further two years for live
 audio content.
</p>
<p> 
 The vote constitutes the European Parliament’s first reading of
 the proposed directive. The EU Council of Ministers, made up
 of government ministers from all member states,  may now
 accept, reject or adapt the recommendations, for further
 subsequent discussion with Parliament.
</p>
<p> 
 In a statement following this week’s vote the European Blind
 Union, an umbrella group of blidness associations from 43
 countries including the RNIB in the UK, welcomed “ the strong
 message sent by the European Parliament to EU governments”.
</p>
<p> 
 However it urged rapid action – “within days” – by the current
 Greek Presidency of the EU to schedule meetings to discuss the
 directive, something it says is currently not planned other than
 in general terms.
</p>
<p> 
 “It is not enough for the Greek Presidency to have this
 directive on their ‘to do' list”, EBU President Wolfgang
 Angermann said in the statement. “If the presidency refuses to
 organise a meeting to discuss the directive with member states
 then they are effectively blocking the legislative process.
</p>
<p> 
 “When 92% of MEPs are calling for action, we believe that
 council members should listen and engage… Failure to act will
 delay new rules for many months and therefore be hugely
 detrimental for the 30 million blind and partially sighted EU
 citizens who struggle to access information and services
 online”, Angermann said. “People with sight loss have been
 shut out of the online world for far too long.”

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Audio Interaction For 'Swype' Virtual Keyboard App</h3>
<p> 
 The popular ‘Swype’ virtual keyboard app for Android
 smartphones, designed to allow users to type more quickly and
 effectively, has introduced audio accessibility features to its
 latest version in a move which will benefit users with impaired
 vision.
</p>
<p> 
 Users of the standard ‘Swype’ app type words by sliding a
 finger across a virtual keyboard in a continuous motion,
 beginning at the first letter and pausing briefly at each letter
 they want to include, before lifting their finger at the end of
 each word. The app then predicts the word, and correction
 features help the process.
</p>
<p> 
 In the latest version of Swype, users can activate it to work
 with Android’s ‘TalkBack’ and ‘Explore by Touch’
 accessibility features so that individual letters and words are
 spoken out loud to users as they slide their fingers across the
 virtual keyboard.
</p>
<p> 
 Working in this ‘TalkBack’ mode also enables audio versions
 of the predictive text and correction features. For example,
 depending on what letters of a word have already been written,
 users can move their fingers to the top of the smartphone
 screen and scroll through lists of words suggested and spoken
 by Swype, navigated using circular finger motions.
</p>
<p> 
 Similarly, Swype suggests words to the user depending on what
 has been written, and will learn to recognise common choices.
 Other app navigation, such as switching to the symbols and
 punctuation menu, can also be managed using audio prompts.
</p>
<p> 
 The latest version of Swype also uses Dragon Dictation speech-
 recognition software to allow users to dictate text to the app
 rather than type. Swype can be purchased for a few pounds
 through the Google Play platform or Amazon Appstore.

<h3 id="i165-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Inclusion Price-tag:</h3>
<p>  The cost of ensuring every adult in the UK has basic digital skills by 2020 – including the ability to
 use email, browse the web and use online shopping and
 government services – would be &pound;875 million, a new report
 estimates. The study, published by national digital inclusion
 bodies the Tinder Foundation and Go ON UK, covers all 11
 million adults who currently lack such skills, including people
 with disabilities. It urges government, the private and voluntary
 sectors to work together to cover the training costs, which it
 says are needed on top of all current planned activity in this
 field. The report estimates the cost of training for each person
 will range from &pound;47 up to &pound;319 depending on various factors
 including disability:

<p>  Two readers wrote in to respond to last issue’s request for information on retina software to navigate
 an iPad, sent in by Alick Mackenzie of Enabled City
 (www.enabledcity.com) to help the father of a friend who has
 multiple sclerosis.
</p>
<p> 
 Gary Derwent, joint head of assistive and rehabilitation
 technology at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability, wrote in
 to say: “The funding situation for eye-gaze technology in the
 NHS in England is very tricky right now. Some parts of the
 contry can get some funding and others cannot.
</p>
<p> 
 “We hope things will be better from the start of April, but right
 now we don't know for sure. There is a lot of politics and
 commissioning activity going on right now and the outcome
 remains uncertain.”
</p>
<p> 
 Health data accessibility campaigner Howard Leicester adds a
 little more detail to this analysis. He says: “Variations on
 funding are due to local politics; potentially competing calls on
 limited funds; and guiding documents (such as Joint Strategic
 Needs Assessments) which cover local population health and
 social needs, but often ignore the scale and characteristics of
 disability requirements.
</p>
<p> 
 “Extra-specialist services are not commissioned by Clinical
 Commissioning Groups led by GPs or by councils, but (I
 believe) directly by NHS England. Specialist services are
 grouped around Clinical Reference Groups (CRGS), with
 services commissioned and delivered in regional areas across
 England.
</p>
<p> 
 “Assistive technologies such as eye-gaze technology is covered
 under the group serving trauma patients, Group D, Howard
 says. Information can be found online under the heading
 ‘Complex disability equipment - Alternative/Augmentative
 communications technology’ at:

 “I don't think there are any details of what's provided, but you

<h3 id="i165-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Strings Attached?</h3>
<p>  Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, from the Kingston upon Thames Association for the Blind,
 writes in to comment on the news we reported last issue that
 software developer GW Micro had reached a deal with
 Microsoft to give away its Window-Eyes screen reader
 software for free.
</p>
<p> 
 “I feel [the Window-Eyes offer] is not as good as it sounds”,
 Brian writes. “When people want a
 screenreader, they often try them out and decide on what is
 best for them. Now we have Microsoft saying ‘this one is free
 if you pay for our Office package’, so lots of people will make
 do with it, and not try the others.”
</p>
<p> 
 He writes that it is also unfair to bundle together mentions of
 the two free screenreaders Thunder and NVDA, since NVDA
 is has been more extensively developed than Thunder. “NVDA
 now supports touch in Windows 8, and has better support for
 many other programs, and a team of add on writers making it
 work with other software.
</p>
<p> 
 “So really NVDA still has many things to make it worthwhile.
 Additionally of course, not everyone can afford Microsoft
 Office in the first place, and work between [free open source
 office software] LibreOffice, Open Office and NVDA teams
 are gradually cracking this.
</p>
<p> 
 “Incidentally, You mentioned in your piece, the voice
 synthesiser Eloquence. As far as I am aware, this is now only
 bundled with [certain commercial] products. It is not available
 to buy. It would be great if someone  outside could investigate
 the situation here. I personally find the voice sounds like a
 person with a clothes peg on their nose, but many do like it.”

<p>  The same reader, Brian Gaff, adds a request for comments on a separate topic, to which our readers
 may like to respond. He asks if modern consumer satellite
 location technologies (GPS) are now accurate enough to keep
 blind people safe in shared or partially shared outdoor streets
 or areas – partly pedestrianised areas where cars can pass
 through, and where there are no tactile indications of the safe
 areas.
</p>
<p> 
 “So on a street, usually a shopping street, where there are no
 kerbs, but cars are only allowed between lines, could GPS be
 used to warn a blind person that they are about to go into the
 shared area?
</p>

 Who says that success does not come with a price tag?
 Especially when there are secrets lurking in the background,
 and this was Senator Christian Jansen's downfall. There was
 one who did not want the senator to run as president because
 he would be too difficult to handle. Another wanted the
 senator dead for breaking his promise to an oil company. And
 a Mafia boss who felt that the senator would be dangerous to

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Escaping The Mousetrapby Clive Lever.
</h3>
<p> 
 Heard the one about the technological mousetrap?
</p>
<p> 
 No, not the play which has been running in the West End since
 the 1950s: it’s the situation that has trapped people who
 navigate computers using just the keyboard –not the mouse –
 for far too long. It’s time to solve this case.
</p>
<p> 
 The pace of technology change in the work place is growing
 ever faster, and wherever there are changes, there are
 inevitably teething troubles. These in turn drive up the need for
 people to call their technology help desks when things go
 wrong, or when it’s not obvious how to change software
 settings.
</p>
<p> 
 Whatever the reason for contacting them, the majority of
 support engineers can answer the query for mouse users in
 about ten seconds flat. However, when the caller says they
 need to perform the action using only the keyboard shortcuts,
 more often than not the engineer runs off to find who knows
 something about this, and the caller is put on hold.
</p>
<p> 
 When the support officer returns, his or her next gambit
 generally begins with the dreaded “unfortunately”, and ends
 with a call being logged to have the problem looked into. What
 happens next is someone usually emails you back the
 following day with the answer you would have got instantly if
 you had been a mouse user.
</p>
<p> 
 It may not be possible to consider training all IT support
 engineers to be experts in the detailed use of keystrokes, or in
 meeting the needs of people who use access technology. It
 would ease the frustration of those people though, if at least
 one member of every support team could be trained in access
 technology awareness and in using a computer without
 touching the mouse, so that we don’t risk having to wait for a
 day or so to get answers that would ordinarily be on hand
 during the first call we make.
</p>
<p> 
 It would also be useful if all IT support engineers setting up
 new software for people who do not use a mouse at least know
 where keyboard shortcut lists can be found on the system – by
 use of keystrokes.
</p>
<p> 
 They also need to know, at the very least, how letters are
 highlighted to indicate what keystrokes will perform the
 operation. It would even help if all IT support engineers knew
 that, for example, you can jump to icons on your desktop, or
 files in a tree structure, by typing in the first part of the names
 of the items. It would appear that even this is often fresh news
 to some technicians. So, it is so much easier to find items on
 your desktop named “Word”, “Excel”, “Access” “Outlook”,
 than it is to deal with them when all of their names have the
 default prefix ‘Microsoft’, because the system administrators
 do not know that this can be unhelpful.
</p>
<p> 
 One way or another, the matter of supporting non-mouse users
 in the workplace needs to be addressed, or we risk having a
 two-tier system of support, where mouse users get instant help,
 and non-mouse users are trapped in a slow lane of tech
 support.
</p>
<p> 
 Support query systems could even be structured so that access-
 related calls automatically go to the top of the queue.
</p>
<p> 
 Either way, IT departments need to capture and make available
 knowledge of the experience of working without a mouse as
 they acquire it,  so non-mouse users are not forced to wait
 unnecessarily for service while technicians go off and re-learn
 what should already be known.
</p>
<p> 
 That is the technological mousetrap: and it is time to break free.
</p>
