<h3 id="i172-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Mps, Academics Condemn Research Funding Withdrawal</h3>
<p>  
 A group of MPs, academics and technologists have 
 condemned the cancellation by the UK Department of Health 
 (DH) of a long-standing contract for an annual independent 
 report on assistive technology research and development.
</p>
<p>  
 Production of an annual report on government-funded 
 research to improve AT is a statutory requirement, set out in 
 the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.
</p>
<p>  
 However after 15 years of allocating funding to the 
 Foundation for Assistive Technology (FAST) to produce the 
 work, the DH announced last month it is to bring production 
 in-house to its research and development directorate, at an 
 estimated annual saving of &pound;68,000.
</p>
<p>  
 In a statement, FAST said the move was “short-sighted” and 
 “a false economy”, as it would lead to lower quality 
 information being made available to policy makers, funding 
 bodies and others. Overall it “will significantly hamper efforts 
 to support disabled and older people to become independent 
 through the use of technology,” the foundation said, as the 
 DH report proposal is “insubstantial” and “only minimally 
 meets the statutory requirement.”
</p>
<p>  
 The withdrawal of the contract also means FAST will no 
 longer have the resources to update a publicly-available 
 database it has been maintaining on AT research and 
 development, it said (
 <a href="http://fastuk.org/research/projects.php">http://fastuk.org/research/projects.php</a>
 ).</p>
<p>  
 In its own statement, the DH responded that this public 
 information is already available elsewhere online, such as 
 Research Councils UK’s Gateway to Research, and the EU 
 CORDIS database. However FAST says these sites do not 
 provide a comprehensive picture.
</p>
<p>  
 Seven MPs and more than 30 academics and technologists 
 have so far supported FAST’s call for continued funding 
 including EA Draffan and Mike Wald of Southampton 
 University; Gill Whitney of Middlesex University; and Tim 
 Adlam of Designability.

<h3 id="i172-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Lib Dems Are First To Make Digital Access Election Pledge</h3>
<p>  
 A pledge to review relevant laws, guidelines and standards 
 on access to digital goods and services to ensure fair access 
 by disabled and older people has become the official policy 
 of the UK’s Liberal Democrats in the run-up to next year’s 
 general election.
</p>
<p>  
 The pledge came as an amendment to the party’s equalities 
 policy paper “Expanding opportunity, unlocking potential” 
 which was submitted to the party's autumn conference for 
 approval earlier this month.
</p>
<p>  
 The party has now promised, if elected to govern or as part of 
 a new coalition government subject to negotiation, to conduct 
 “a review of anti-discrimination law and of existing laws, 
 guidelines and standards on access to digital goods and 
 services to ensure they are fit for the modern age and so that, 
 in particular, people with disabilities and older people have 
 fair access to digital public services, the digital economy and 
 the workplace”.
</p>
<p>  
 The amendment was moved by Mark Pack, Editor of Liberal 
 Democrat Newswire, on behalf of One Voice for Accessible 
 ICT Coalition, which is campaigning for all the main UK 
 political parties to pledge similar action ahead of the 2015 
 elections. MPs and policymakers in the Labour and 
 Conservative parties are currently considering making similar 
 undertakings.
</p>
<p>  
 One Voice, an umbrella group of charities, businesses and 
 other organisations pushing for better digital accessibility 
 across society, has called for the review in light of poor legal 
 enforcement of existing laws, rules and guidelines for 
 accessibility of websites, mobile apps and other digital goods 
 and services across the public and private sectors.

<h3 id="i172-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Technology Pioneers In ‘Disability Power List’</h3>
<p>  
 Champions of digital accessibility feature prominently in the 
 first ever “disability power list”, a round-up of Britain's 100 
 most influential people with a disability or impairment 
 selected by recruitment firm Powerful Media in partnership 
 with non-profit disability support group the Shaw Trust.
</p>
<p>  
 Top of the list is scientist Stephen Hawking, perhaps the 
 world’s best-known user of synthesised speech 
 communication and winner of a special prize at the 2012 
 Technology4Good Awards from charity AbilityNet. In 
 second place is Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson, one of 
 Britain’s greatest Paralympians and supporter last year of Go 
 ON Gold, a national campaign to raise awareness about 
 barriers faced by disabled people in accessing computers and 
 the Internet.
</p>
<p>  
 Fifth overall came actor, writer, broadcaster and technology 
 early-adopter Stephen Fry, who has been diagnosed with 
 bipolar disorder and has supported many disability 
 technology access projects including the Fix the Web project 
 led by Citizens Online.
</p>
<p>  
 Other digital pioneers in the list include entrepreneur and 
 philanthropist Neil Barnfather, founder and director of 
 TalkNav, a supplier of accessible mobile devices to the blind 
 and low vision community; Gary McFarlane, managing 
 director of Assist-Mi, a mobile app that allows people with 
 disabilities to request assistance from service providers such 
 as petrol stations and airports; Amar Latif, founder and 
 director of ‘Traveleyes’, the world’s first commercial air tour 
 operator to specialise in serving blind as well as sighted 
 travellers; and Euan McDonald, founder of disabled access 
 review website euansguide.com.
</p>
<p>  
 Also recognised are consultant Geoff Adams-Spink, who 
 covered many technology accessibility stories in his former 
 role as age and disability correspondent for BBC News; 
 Caroline Waters, vice chair of the Equality and Human Rights 
 Commission and former policy director at BT; and 
 Paralympian gold medallist wheelchair sprinter Hannah 
 Cockcroft, keynote speaker at last year’s eAccess 13 
 conference.

<h3 id="i172-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: GARI First:</h3>
<p>  Australian telecom operator Telstra has  become the first mobile communications carrier in the world 
 to fully integrate data from GARI (Global Accessibility 
 Reporting Initiative) into its own customer information portal, 
 the initiative has announced. GARI is an information 
 database on accessibility features of mobile devices launched 
 in 2010 by the Mobile Manufacturers Forum (MMF), an 
 international association of mobile equipment manufacturers. 
 The new portal
 <a href="http://telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/find-accessible-devices">http://telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/find-accessible-devices</a>

 allows Telstra users to search for handsets with specific 
 accessibility features related to speech, hearing, vision, 
 cognitive impairment and reduced mobility.
 Previously, promoters of the GARI service have tended to be 
 public sector bodies and telecoms regulators and associations, 
 such as new recruits the Romanian telecommunications 
 regulator ANCOM and the South African Electronic 
 Communications Association SAECA:

backed International Day of Persons with Disabilities, set to 
take place on 3 December. Three sub-themes for the day 
focus on disability-inclusive sustainable development goals; 
disaster risk reduction and emergency responses; and creating 
enabling work environments. Any organisation with an 
interest in the field can organise an event to mark the day, the 
UN says, including public discussions, information 
campaigns, performances and innovation showcases. 
Organisations are also invited to send in links to videos or 
short films promoting any of the objectives of the

 06: Government Gaps: Fewer than a third of global 
 governments (32%) provide funding to support digital 
 accessibility work by disability organisations, according to an 
 article published this month in the Journal of Disability and 
 International Development. The article, “Removing barriers 
 and advancing digital accessibility”, was written by Martin 
 Gould, Axel Leblois, Francesca Cesa Bianchi and Viviana 
 Montenegro of the UN-backed G3ict (Global Initiative for 
 Inclusive ICTs). The four write that “Removing digital 
 accessibility barriers and developing sustainable local 
 capabilities among [disabled people’s groups]... will require 
 commitment by State Parties to capacity building.” However 
 as well as the funding gap, the paper says only about a fifth 
 of governments (21%) have systematically reviewed 
 legislation or policies on digital access support for disability 
 organisations; only 27% of government have set up national 
 technical assistance centres in the field; and even fewer (11%) 
 have mandated digital access training programs for future 
 professionals at universities and vocational schools:

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Declaration Of Independenceby Donna Jodhan.
</h3>
<p>  
 In late 2013 the Canadian national elections agency Elections 
 Canada formed an Advisory Group on Disability Issues, and 
 I was invited to be a member. Initiatives the agency is 
 working on include ensuring election staff are trained to meet 
 the needs of voters with a disability; developing a Braille 
 template to help Blind and partially-sighted voters; ensuring 
 that voters with a disability can vote more independently and 
 with greater privacy; and monitoring progress and how 
 initiatives are being implemented.
</p>
<p>  
 This month, citizens in Toronto tested out some of these 
 principles as they made a trip to the polls – their third in about 
 five months – to vote for a new mayor; their local councillor; 
 and a school board trustee in their area.
</p>
<p>  
 This time however, things were quite a bit different for voters 
 with disabilities, as we were able to use a new “voter access 
 terminal” allowing people with a disability to vote 
 independently.
</p>
<p>  
 As a Blind voter, I was extremely excited about this new 
 development as it gave me the opportunity to take my time 
 when voting and I was able to do it without having to 
 depend on a returning officer to help me.
</p>
<p>  
 I was able to take my headphones along and plug them into 
 the terminal's jack. There were several well defined buttons 
 that were easy to distinguish, enabling one to review the list 
 of names for each category; make repeated reviews; select a 
 candidate for each position; and confirm one's choice.
</p>
<p>  
 So in short, I was able to sit in front of this new voter access 
 machine, fetch a list of candidates, make my choice from this 
 list and then submit my choice. I also had the choice not to 
 vote for anyone if I so chose.
</p>
<p>  
 The voice on this terminal was extremely clear and distinct 
 and the beauty about it all is that I as a blind person was able 
 to vote in private without anyone knowing whom I have 
 voted for and at the end of it all I was able to remove my 
 own ballot from the terminal's output tray and place it myself 
 into the ballot box.
</p>
<p>  
 Easy as anything, and a terrific invention: now let us see if 
 this terminal will be able to make its way up the ladder to 
 provincial and federal elections. Some time during the course 
 of 2015, Canada will once more be going to the polls to elect 
 a new federal government, and Elections Canada has already 
 indicated that we can look forward to some important 
 changes when it comes to improved accessibility for these 
 elections as well.
</p>
<p>  
 I believe that if countries are truly serious about wanting 
 persons with disabilities to be an active part of their voting 
 population then it is vitally important for meaningful dialogue 
 to take place between the governmental body in charge of the 
 running of elections and a representative segment of 
 organisations for and of those with disabilities. We should 
 never assume that governments would naturally know how to 
 proceed in a matter such as this and it is up to voters with 
 disabilities to speak up in a meaningful way.
