<h3 id="i166-01"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: New Standard Aims To Make 'Rich' Web Content Accessible</h3>
<p> 
 A new technical standard to ensure so-called 'rich' web content - dynamic, 
 interactive features of many modern web pages - can be made more accessible 
 to people with disabilities have been published by the international World 
 Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
</p>
<p> 
 The Accessible Rich Internet Applications 1.0 specification (WAI-ARIA - 
 <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria</a>
 ) has become a W3C 'Recommendation' - the  body's term for an official standard.
</p>
<p> 
 The new group of documents includes a technical specification and primer for 
 developers of web technologies and developers of assistive technologies. It 
 covers complex web navigation techniques created using technologies that can 
 run applications inside web pages such as Ajax and JavaScript. These include 
 'tree controls' - menus that expand or collapse in a tree-like structure; 
 'drag-and-drop' functionality such as slider controls; and content that 
 changes over time such as progress bars.
</p>
<p> 
 WAI-ARIA sets out ways such content can be identified, described and 
 controlled by users of assistive technology such as screenreaders, or people 
 who cannot use a mouse. For example it offers a framework for drag-and-drop 
 feature properties that describe drag sources and drop targets.
</p>
<p> 
 The new standard is designed to help implement existing web accessibility 
 standards such as WAI's own Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 
 in a modern context, W3C WAI director Judy Brewer told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;WAI-ARIA is essentially one way of meeting WCAG 2.0,&quot; Brewer said. &quot;The 
 principles, guidelines and success criteria from WCAG 2.0 remain remarkably 
 stable - so the &quot;rules,&quot; so to speak, haven't changed. It's just that there 
 are now more powerful ways to use those in websites and applications because 
 of the availability of ARIA.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 One of the benefits of creating the new ARIA standard and implementation 
 guidance is to ensure developers do not needlessly work in parallel creating 
 their own accessibility solutions for each new interactive web feature, she 
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Without the WAI-ARIA technology, developers would have to customize their 
 accessibility solutions for different platforms and devices. With ARIA, they 
 get cross-device, cross-platform accessibility support, and can more easily 
 repurpose their content and applications in different settings without 
 losing any accessibility support.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The specification will now evolve, with a working draft of WAI-ARIA 1.1 
 already published for consultation ahead of an even stronger 2.0 version, as 
 her team continues to watch how technology changes and keep ahead in the 
 race for accessibility, Brewer said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The constant emergence of new technologies requires a lot of vigilance on 
 the part of accessibility experts and advocates&quot;, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There's still a tendency for developers of new technologies to forget that 
 people using the web have varied physical, sensory and cognitive 
 capabilities - and that the digital medium provides such an excellent 
 platform for accommodating all of these variations in human functioning if 
 one just remembers to plan for it at the design stage.&quot;

<h3 id="i166-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Only A Quarter Of Uk Council Websites Accessible, Report Finds</h3>
<p> 
 Only a quarter of UK local authority websites are accessible to people with 
 disabilities, significantly fewer than last year, according to this year's 
 'Better Connected' council website review by the public sector Society of IT 
 Management (Socitm).
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, 105 councils (26%) were rated by the Socitm report as at least 
 'satisfactory', defined as having few serious and practical accessibility 
 problems, with just one- Preston City - rated 'very good'. Last year, 194 
 councils (44%) were rated at this level.
</p>
<p> 
 Some 311 sites (76%) this year were rated as 'poor', and 12 (3%) as entirely 
 'inaccessible', according to tests checks carried out for Socitm by 
 non-profit accessibility testing firm Digital Accessibility Centre, based on 
 the WCAG 2.0 global web access standard. The tests checked website 'top 
 level' pages - the main index pages for each council service - as well as 
 the accessibility of carrying out sample tasks such as reporting flytipping 
 to a council using a mobile phone; or finding out about a care home for an 
 elderly relative.
</p>
<p> 
 The drop in standards this year is attributed by the report to the 
 introduction of accessibility tests on the site carried out using mobile 
 devices, which resulted in scores on average only half as good as those 
 recorded in tests using desktop computers.
</p>
<p> 
 The most common accessibility problems for council websites accessed by 
 desktop computer were lack of clear labels for form fields and associated 
 controls; downloadable 'non-html' documents such as pdf files being 
 inaccessible; poor heading structure; and insufficient colour contrast. For 
 access by mobile devices, common problems also included a lack of mobile 
 alternative option for the desktop site.
</p>
<p> 
 The report (<a href="http://www.socitm.net/research/socitm-insight/better-connected">http://www.socitm.net/research/socitm-insight/better-connected</a>
 )  recommends all councils should build accessibility into their criteria for 
 web site procurement; build accessibility checks into their web publishing 
 process; and carry out user testing with disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 The figures emerged just a few days after the European Parliament voted to 
 strengthen a proposed European Directive on the Accessibility of Public 
 Sector Bodies' Websites, which would require EU member states to ensure all 
 public websites are fully accessible.
</p>
<p> 
 The new law could come into force as early as next year, suggesting UK 
 councils would struggle to comply, although member states would be likely to 
 be allowed a further year to comply for new public sector web content, and 
 three years for existing content (see E-Access Bulletin, February 2014 
 issue).

<h3 id="i166-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Global Mobile Accessibility Database Set For Overhaul</h3>
<p> 
 The world's leading database of information on the accessibility features of 
 mobile phones and tablet computers is set to be refreshed with extensive new 
 information, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 GARI (Global Accessibility Reporting Initiative - 
 <a href="http://www.mobileaccessibility.info">http://www.mobileaccessibility.info</a>
 ) was launched in 2010 by the Mobile  Manufacturers Forum (MMF), an international association of mobile 
 telecommunications equipment manufacturers.
</p>
<p> 
 Initially covering just a few accessibility features for mobile phones, it 
 has since been expanded to store information on more than 100 features of 
 phones and tablet computers of interest to users with access issues relating 
 to dexterity; vision; hearing/speech; and cognition.
</p>
<p> 
 Last year it was further expanded to include 'apps' (applications) that help 
 to make mobile devices more accessible such as screenreaders, or help people 
 with disabilities to perform everyday tasks such as TapTapSee, an app which 
 can use a phone's camera to identify objects and speak them out loud.
</p>
<p> 
 The resource - which covers all global regions - was developed with 
 international disability organisations including World Blind Union, European 
 Disability Forum, World Federation of the Deaf. It holds information in 12 
 written and spoken languages plus American Sign Language with a 13th 
 language, Japanese, to be added shortly.
</p>
<p> 
 It was originally set up because accessibility information on consumer 
 devices seemed to be getting lost on the way to the user, Sabine Lobnig, 
 communications and regulatory officer at the MMF, told E-Access Bulletin. 
 &quot;Manufacturers had feedback from disability organisations that even if they 
 do provide accessibility information for devices, this information does not 
 usually arrive with the end consumer&quot;, Lobnig said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Whether it is sold through a wholesaler, on the internet or wherever, 
 information on accessibility is lost. So consumers end up with a device that 
 could be accessible for them but they do not have the information.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Another purpose for GARI is to act as an official compliance reporting 
 mechanism for mobile manufacturers in countries such as Australia, Portugal 
 and the US where legal accessibility requirements are already in place, she 
 said. The system pulls in data to templates designed to meet the 
 requirements of each country's relevant law. In Europe, no such legal 
 requirements currently exist at EU or national level, though an EU 
 accessibility act currently in development might introduce them in future.
</p>
<p> 
 The GARI dataset available for organisations to embed in their own websites 
 (free for non-commercial use); and acts as a platform where policy makers, 
 industry and disability organisations can exchange information and work 
 together on improving accessibility of mobile phones, tablets and apps.
</p>
<p> 
 Its main data store is reviewed every 12-18 months with the most recent 
 consultation with suppliers and disability organisations being held in 
 November 2013, Lobnig said. The results were then considered with new 
 features set to be agreed by the GARI management team next week, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 GARI is free to use and developers list apps for free, though manufacturers 
 pay to have their hardware products included.

<h3 id="i166-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>04: Learning Signs:</h3>
<p>  A computer programme that can recognise sign language  and convert it into text or speech; and conversely convert text and speech 
 into sign language using an animated avatar has been developed by a Polish 
 company, Migam. The project appears in an international 'Social Tech Guide' 
 listing examples of technology for social good, compiled by charitable 
 foundation the Nominet Trust.
 According to a report by Dan Sutch and Ed Anderton of Nominet Trust 
 published on the Real Business website, the Migam system uses neural network 
 techniques to &quot;learn&quot; sign language from repeated inputs of sign language 
 expressed both correctly and incorrectly many times over:

<h3 id="i166-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Irrational Fear:</h3>
<p>  Reader Hugh McLeod writes in with a personal response  to our lead news story last issue, &quot;BCS to tackle 'unconscious bias' against 
 disabled IT job applicants&quot;, which reported on a new scheme to combat 
 unconscious discrimination against disabled people.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Fear of blindness, like fear of falling or of drowning, is natural&quot; writes 
 Hugh. &quot;But like so many natural fears, fear of blindness among the sighted 
 is irrational or ignorant bigotry.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Yesterday I told my 64-year-old brother that a blind man on a flat roof is 
 at no more risk than a sighted man. The danger for both arises from getting 
 on or off the roof and from pure stupidity. But my brother, after more than 
 half a century still loves me and does not understand that my blindness is 
 just part of me.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I think most sighted people, and too many blind people, refuse to see. Like 
 racism, sexism and any other phobia or &quot;-ism&quot;, the demeaning of the blind is 
 due to unexamined ignorance.&quot;

<h3 id="i166-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Thunder Rumbles:</h3>
<p>  Roger Wilson-Hinds, director of Screenreader.net which  has developed free screenreader software Thunder, writes in to respond to a 
 comment in last issue's Inbox from our reader Brian Gaff. Brian in turn was 
 commenting on our previous news report that software developer GW Micro had 
 reached a deal with Microsoft to give away its Window-Eyes screen reader 
 software for free. Brian had suggested this offer was &quot;not as good as it 
 sounds&quot;, since it may mean people 'making do' with Window-Eyes because it is 
 free, when other screenreaders may be better for them.
</p>
<p> 
 However, Roger counters: &quot;The current screenreader position for blind and 
 visually disabled people has never been better. Now we have choice: 
 Window-Eyes free with up-to-date Microsoft software; JAWS widely used in the 
 work and education situation; NVDA up to date and becoming more and more 
 sophisticated; Guide for the less technical; and our Thunder,  getting on 
 and out of date but easy to use on old machines. Not to mention the Mac, 
 when Apple were the first to integrate our needs into the bowels of their 
 system.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Why grumble? We are spoiled for choice, and many of us spend more time on 
 our mobiles or tablets than on the PC, in any case.&quot;

<p>  Meanwhile our same trusty correspondent Brian Gaff  writes in with his response to last issue's feature by Clive Lever about a 
 lack of awareness among IT support staff of issues faced by keyboard-only 
 computer users.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;One thing Clive does not mention in his piece is the increasing use by 
 support staff of remote desktop systems&quot;, Brian writes.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I have run across this quite a bit and the pitfall here is they offer to 
 sort out a problem you have, but in doing so, often change settings without 
 telling you, so the software is no longer configured as it was before, and 
 this can under some circumstances mean another call just afterwards asking 
 for it to be changed back again.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There is another issue here too: if a blind person nowadays wants to apply 
 for a job as a support engineer, it is often specified that they must be 
 able to use these remote access programs, and sadly I know of none that can 
 actually be used by blind people, unless there is a screenreader on the 
 remote machine itself.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>10: Citizen Journalists Find Their Voice On The Virtual High Streetby Tristan Parker.
</h3>
<p> 
 A wheelchair user's struggle to use the car park at the town hall, to attend 
 her brother's wedding; an elderly man's description of how he improved his 
 diet to help his health; and one woman's tale of learning sign language to 
 help others. These are all real examples of self-help and mutual support 
 videos created by and for an inspirational project in the South West of 
 England offering older people and people with disabilities peer support for 
 independent living.
</p>
<p> 
 The online video project 'ADTV' ( <a href="http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org">http://www.accessdorsetcentre.org</a>
 ) was  launched by Access Dorset, a user-led charity partnership formed in 2010 by 
 17 organisations across the county supporting people with disabilities, 
 older people and carers.
</p>
<p> 
 The project's website features a 'virtual high street', with different areas 
 representing different aspects of independent living such as transport, 
 safety, money matters and leisure. Clicking on each of these topics takes 
 the user to a series of videos made by the site's members sharing stories 
 and experiences on that topic.
</p>
<p> 
 The videos are well-made, thanks to 'citizen journalism' skills such as 
 writing a storyboard and producing a short video taught to some of the site's 
 members by Bournemouth University. Members are also taught how to train 
 others as citizen journalists, to help the project grow.
</p>
<p> 
 Dave Thompson, development manager at Access Dorset, told E-Access Bulletin 
 the idea for the virtual high street and user-centred videos arose from 
 extensive consultation with organisations that work with older people and 
 those with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We're a small organisation without a huge amount of funding, so how do we 
 go about making films that can actually tell those stories and produce them 
 as cheaply as possible? That's where we came up with the idea of looking at 
 the broader concept of citizen journalism&quot;, Thompson said.
</p>
<p> 
 Dr Einar Thorsen, senior lecturer in journalism and communication at 
 Bournemouth University, has been taking a key role in teaching Access Dorset 
 members the citizen journalism skills needed to produce their videos. &quot;The 
 project has different ways of empowering people&quot;, Thorsen told E-Access 
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 Many of those making the videos are concerned about a lack of coverage or 
 inefficient coverage of issues associated with disability, impairments and 
 ageing in mainstream media, Thorsen said. &quot;The website has an empowering 
 function to give otherwise marginalised voices an ability to be heard, and 
 that's quite a powerful thing&quot;, Thorsen said.
</p>
<p> 
 Funding for ADTV has arrived from a diverse range of national and local 
 funders and sponsors. The Office for Disability Issues has provided grant 
 funding, and organisations can sponsor individual sections of the virtual 
 high street: Bluebird Care in Dorset sponsor the 'Our Home' section and 
 Castlepoint Shopping Park in Bournemouth sponsor 'Leisure'.

 In the longer term, Thompson said there is &quot;a possibility of replicating and 
 broadening out&quot; the project in other parts of the UK, although the current 
 focus is on developing it around Dorset. &quot;We've already had a few 
 conversations about the possibility of how we could take the concept and 
 share it with others&quot;, he said. &quot;We need to look at different ways of 
 funding the project, and part of that is scaling up.&quot;

 Coming soon to a virtual high street near you?
