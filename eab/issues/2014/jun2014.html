<h3 id="i169-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: One Voice Launches 2015 Election Pledge Campaign</h3>
<p> 
 A campaign urging all UK political parties to add digital accessibility 
 pledges to their 2015 election manifestos has been launched by the One Voice 
 for Accessible ICT Coalition.
</p>
<p> 
 The coalition is an umbrella group of organisations from all sectors 
 including Leonard Cheshire Disability; BT; Middlesex University; Business 
 Disability Forum and Barclays Bank.
</p>
<p> 
 Its new campaign has two main parts: a direct approach to the political 
 parties and a petition on the open campaigns website '38 Degrees' 
 (https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/building-an-inclusive-society).
</p>
<p> 
 It is centred on a call for &quot;all political parties to reaffirm their 
 previously stated goals for equal opportunities and economic growth, by 
 adding a statement to their 2015 election manifestos pledging to improve 
 access by people with disabilities to digital public services, the digital 
 economy and the workplace.
</p>
<p> 
 It is vital that action is taken in this field now, to ensure we keep on top 
 of the rising problem of digital discrimination.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In particular, the coalition is asking the main UK parties to pledge if 
 elected to t review of anti-discrimination law to &quot;see if it is fit for 
 purpose in the digital age; and to see how existing laws, guidelines and 
 standards on access to digital goods and services by disabled and older 
 people can be better enforced across all sectors.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In background information published alongside the petition, the coalition 
 notes that the government has already published reasonable accessibility 
 guidelines in its Government Service Design Manual for the Digital by 
 Default Service Standard 
 (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/accessibility).
</p>
<p> 
 However, it warns: &quot;We are concerned that such messages are still not 
 strongly enough promoted or enforced across the whole of government. And 
 outside central government, in local government and the NHS for example, the 
 pattern of accessibility of digital services is even more patchy.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It is also a concern that the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which 
 was set up in 2006 with a mandate to &quot;challenge discrimination&quot;, has 
 undertaken very little research, issued little guidance and carried out 
 little enforcement work in this vital area. This is a clear indicator that 
 review of anti-discrimination law enforcement in this field is urgently 
 needed.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Andy Heath, a consultant on digital accessibility (<a href="http://axelafa.com">http://axelafa.com</a>
) and  One Voice council member who is running the petition on behalf of the 
 coalition, told E-Access Bulletin this week: &quot;Technology can serve us all, 
 or if we let it, it can serve only the few. Accessibility of digital 
 information in the UK is not a done deal, its a work in progress.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I see the support of the next government it as crucial to the progress of 
 inclusion and accessibility in the UK and making a high level manifesto 
 statement would show a commitment to that. We need the policy vision out 
 there in view so all can see, not buried in a dusty filing cabinet. Whether 
 you believe competition between people, organisations and nations, is a good 
 way to go or not, we cannot afford to waste the talents of any of our people 
 by excluding them - for their sakes and ours.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Heath urged all readers of E-Access Bulletin to sign the petition (The 
 petition, Building an Inclusive Society
</p>
<p> 
 https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/building-an-inclusive-society), and 
 promote it on social media and through other channels, as the parties enter 
 the final stages of their manifesto-setting processes this summer.

<h3 id="i169-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Accessible Gaming Guidelines Win Us Award</h3>
<p> 
 A set of international guidelines to make computer games more accessible to 
 gamers with disabilities has won an award from the US-based Federal 
 Communications Commission (FCC).
</p>
<p> 
 The Game Accessibility Guidelines 
 (<a href="http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com">http://www.gameaccessibilityguidelines.com</a>
) won the intellectual and  developmental disabilities category of the annual FCC Chairman's Awards for 
 Advancements in Accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 Launched in 2012, the guidelines were created by an international group of 
 game developers, accessibility specialists and academics and cover six 
 categories of impairment: general, motor, cognitive, vision, hearing and 
 speech, and are divided into three levels of complexity: basic, intermediate 
 and advanced.
</p>
<p> 
 Examples of guidelines at different levels of complexity include basic: to 
 provide details of accessibility features on game packaging or website; 
 intermediate: to allow difficulty level to be altered during gameplay; and 
 advanced: to allow settings to be saved to different profiles, at either 
 game or platform level.
</p>
<p> 
 Ian Hamilton, an independent user experience designer and consultant from 
 the UK who contributed to the guidelines' development, told E-Access 
 Bulletin: &quot;Having a US government body make such a public statement about 
 the importance of accessible recreation is a great milestone.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It is recognition that other people are actually listening and paying 
 attention, and they do value the work that various groups of advocates for 
 game accessibility are doing to advance the field.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Since launching in 2012, the guidelines have been constantly developed and 
 updated as a &quot;living document&quot; following feedback from gamers and 
 developers. There is a continual open call to contact the authors, to keep 
 the guidelines as inclusive as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 Hamilton said he hopes the FCC award will help bring to prominence what 
 remains a niche area in the field of digital accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We've seen some pretty rapid development in the past couple of years, but 
 the industry is still way, way behind others&quot;, he said. &quot;Despite the 
 progress that is being made, by far the biggest barrier to accessibility in 
 gaming is just a simple lack of awareness amongst developers. So anything at 
 all that results in more conversation about it is always a fantastic thing.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In an article on the guidelines written in a previous issue of E-Access 
 Bulletin (June 2013 - see <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=891">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=891</a>
 ), Hamilton  wrote that research commissioned in 2008 by US video game developer PopCap 
 ( <a href="http://bit.ly/PYsRwl">http://bit.ly/PYsRwl</a>
 ) found a higher proportion of people with  disabilities among gamers than in the general population.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Games can be a huge contributor to quality of life for people who have 
 limited recreation options, but they also enable access to culture and 
 socialising, and can have therapeutic benefits&quot;, the article found. &quot;In 
 multiplayer games and virtual worlds, everyone is able to participate on a 
 level playing field, with players' first impressions of someone being based 
 on how they play the game and what they say, not on any disability they may 
 have.&quot;

<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Customisable Digital Tube Train Map Wins Design Award</h3>
<p> 
 A customisable version of the London Underground map for people with 
 impaired vision has won best transport app in this month's UK Mobile and App 
 Design Awards, hosted by design100 
 (<a href="http://appdesignawards.co.uk/UKAPPS14/entry_details.asp?ID=12734&amp">http://appdesignawards.co.uk/UKAPPS14/entry_details.asp?ID=12734&amp</a>
;Category_ID=5615).</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Colourblind tube map&quot; was created by digital agency 232 Studios - which 
 also won best small studio - working with accessibility specialist Ian 
 Hamilton, also known for his work on accessible video game guidelines (see 
 previous story, this issue).
</p>
<p> 
 The app is based on the official tube map - &quot;it took some tough licensing 
 negotiations to allow that&quot;, Hamilton says  - and offers combinations of 
 colours and patterns which are easier to read by users with different forms 
 of colourblindness.
</p>
<p> 
 Other versions are designed to cater for other vision impairments such as 
 cataracts, loss of contrast sensitivity and myopia, with features including 
 increased contrast; reduced glare; large detailed high-zoom maps; 
 customisable text size; and simple interfaces with no fiddly gestures
</p>
<p> 
 The app previously won a Judges' Award in last December's Transport for 
 London (TfL) accessible app awards, with the prize money from this helping 
 ensure it could be made available to both Apple and Android users free of 
 charge, Hamilton told E-Access Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The iconic London underground map is relied on by millions of travellers 
 every day, but its white background, small text and low contrast differences 
 in colour can cause problems for people with many different types of 
 impaired vision&quot;, the app's developers say.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;There is a black and white pattern-based map available, but only as a 
 PDF... [but this] is actually left over from the time before colour printing 
 became cheaply available, it isn't actually designed for colour-blindness, 
 so the first enhancement was to produce something that was actually tailored 
 to that audience, that combined colour with pattern to create something 
 ideally suited to people who see in a restricted palette.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Additionally, due to our past experience working on video magnifier 
 software, another use soon became apparent. A pattern based map is free from 
 being constrained by colour choice, meaning those colours can be altered to 
 suit the preferences of people with a wide range of different vision 
 impairments.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The approach taken to develop the app is an example of the benefits digital 
 technology can bring to all kinds of impairments, the developers say. &quot;The 
 tube map in the station is a physical object that has to compromise to work 
 for as many people as possible, but digital products do not have the same 
 constraints. Interfaces can be customised, the best solution tailored to 
 each individual's need.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The same basic principles are also applicable to all map design, they say, 
 and there has been interest in the project from across the cartography 
 community. &quot;Using symbols and pattern as well as colour, or providing high 
 detail imagery that can in turn support a high level of zoom; these are 
 things that are applicable to all maps.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Other winners of December's TfL accessible app competition included London's 
 Nearest Bus, which helps people find what bus stop they are at and when the 
 next bus will arrive; Station Master, which offers detailed train and 
 station access information for tube and overground lines; and Tube Tracker, 
 an app that uses text-to-speech and high colour contrast to ease access to 
 live journey information.

 04: Be Resilient: A social enterprise which aims to help young disabled 
 people share advice by telling stories about their lives is appealing for 
 video clips to be used in a pilot TV programme. 'bResilient' is inviting 
 young people (aged 25 or under) with disabilities - working alone or with 
 friends, carers or family - to make video clips of up to three minutes 
 telling stories about experiences connected with the arts or creating 
 artworks. &quot;Whether you have been gripped by reading a compelling novel; 
 collaborated to perform with a disability dance group; are a sculptor who is 
 blind; or just want to speak about a TV programme which has affected you, we 
 would like you to make a short video and send it to us (or send us a link to 
 it)&quot;, the organisation says. &quot;We will take the best and edit them into a 
 single programme, with a presenter adding commentary.&quot; For more information

 05: Action Stalled: The forthcoming Italian Presidency of the EU must 
 implement a proposal for a Directive on the Accessibility of Public Sector 
 Bodies' Websites, the European Disability Forum has urged. The forum, an 
 umbrella organisation representing the interests of people with disabilities 
 in Europe, said that despite the proposal being advanced over the past two 
 years by the European Commission and the European Parliament, there has been 
 no further progress in the European Council of Ministers during the last two 
 presidencies of the EU under Lithuania and Greece. A clear political 
 commitment is now needed to ensure rapid progress on the Directive during 
 the Italian Presidency, which begins on 1 July, it said. &quot;EDF regrets that 
 the Greek Presidency failed to take this very important legislation further, 
 and hopes that the forthcoming Italian presidency will treat the web 
 directive as a priority... Non-binding political initiatives failed to make 
 the web accessible for persons with disabilities. That is why this directive 
 must cover all public websites as well as public services provided online, 
 regardless of who owns the website, either it is a public or private entity&quot;:

 06: Human Factors: Developing digital interfaces for users with cognitive 
 impairments and people with low or no literacy; ICT for an ageing 
 population; and speech intelligibility in mobile networks were among topics 
 addressed by the annual workshop on Human factors in ICT hosted by European 
 technology standards body ETSI this month in Sophia Antipolis, France. ETSI 
 has already achieved a milestone earlier this year with the publication of 
 the first European Standard for accessible ICT (EN 301 549), intended to 
 ensure that publicly procured websites, software, and digital devices are 
 more accessible to persons with the widest range of abilities (see E-Access 
 Bulletin, February 2014 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1017">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=1017</a>

<h3 id="i169-07"><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Election Glitches:</h3>
<p>  Our regular correspondent and leading accessibility  campaigner from Canada, Donna Jodhan, writes in to describe a recent voting 
 experience following our &quot;access to elections&quot; special issue last month.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;On 12 June I voted in an Ontario Provincial election and whereas my 
 expectation was that I would have had greater access to the voting process, 
 I was disappointed&quot;, Donna writes.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Before 12 June I had seen several commercials on TV where it was stated 
 that the Ontario elections would be accessible in Braille, and I was looking 
 forward to this new feature, but alas! The process was not fully accessible 
 in Braille as had been advertised.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and were very quick on the 
 draw when I asked for a Braille template but here is where the good news 
 ended. The template contained numbers in Braille but there was no Braille 
 list of candidates. Accordingly, the returning officer had to read out the 
 list of names to me and I had to ask her to do this twice as there were five 
 names on the list and I wanted to make sure that I remembered them all along 
 with the corresponding parties that they were representing.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Everything else went smoothly. I was allowed to vote in secret and to fold 
 my own ballot and place it in the ballot box but there was one last thing 
 for me to report. There was no way for me to verify that I had indeed marked 
 my ballot in the spot that I had wanted.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;A good first effort on the part of [provincial election agency] Elections 
 Ontario, but there is more work to be done and hopefully by the next time an 
 election rolls around, these glitches will have been rectified.&quot;

<h3 id="i169-08"><b class="Ps">+</b>08: Unfit Booth:</h3>
<p>  Our regular correspondent Brian Gaff, from the Kingston  upon Thames Association for the Blind, writes in to describe his own recent 
 voting experience, in the UK's recent European Parliamentary elections.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;I seem to be almost unique in my area to still go to a polling station&quot;, 
 writes Brian. &quot;It seems that most blind people around here either do a proxy 
 or a postal vote, which is a little sad.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Normally my borough is quite good at the access stuff, but I found this 
 time all new people were there and the person who helped me did not even 
 know they had to peel the backing off the plastic template, and had 
 difficulty even reading the list in a good way. Still, we got there in the 
 end.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;The booths used are not fit for purpose when you think that the European 
 Parliament ballot paper had 17 parties on it and the booths were basically a 
 circular card table with an X shaped divider, so four small triangular areas 
 were all you had to put the ballot down on. One would have thought by now 
 that at the very least a voting computer with headphones might have been in 
 use!&quot;

<h3 id="i169-09"><b class="Ps">+</b>09: Firefox Additives:</h3>
<p>  Another story from last month's issue, on  accessibility features of the Firefox web browser, is the subject of further 
 comment from Brian Gaff.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;On Firefox, I got the impression that the person  you had in the article 
 was mainly interested in partial sighted use&quot;, Brian writes. &quot;Due to Firefox 
 being completely devoid of any audio cues, I now always install an add on 
 called 'navigational sounds', which restores the clicks for links, the 
 sounds for alerts and the ding for download completed as in Internet 
 Explorer. This makes it a whole lot easier.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Another thing which for me at least, is very important, is an advert 
 blocker. Firefox add-ons also has one of those. It's not that I do not want 
 adverts, but it seems to me that increasingly, advert creators screw up the 
 sites they are used on by not making them in a way that agrees with 
 screenreaders, often throwing them into strange parts of the page due to odd 
 graphic and clever animation. It's about time they fixed their errant ways.&quot;

 by Ann Bajina.
</p>
<p> 
 Why do older people make less use of computers and digital services than 
 younger people?
</p>
<p> 
 Of course, there is the perception that they don't want to simply because 
 the digital world is new, but I don't think that is always the reason. There 
 are some real problems with access for older people.
</p>
<p> 
 Let's look first at the positives, as an older person myself - recognising 
 that I couldn't do without my laptop now, having resisted buying one for a 
 few years! It's great to be able to stay in touch with relatives and friends 
 without needing to know if they are available to take a phone call, and 
 without the feeling that a letter needs to contain important news. I have 
 had health problems and have needed to report in to my daughter every 
 morning and evening just to reassure her that I am OK. By email it is easy - 
 I don't even need to know if she is up yet! And it's free, whether we are 
 countries apart or next door.
</p>
<p> 
 Then mobile phones - what would we do without them now? I take issue with 
 those friends who say they only use them in emergencies and switch them off 
 otherwise - so my question is: so it's only an emergency you have that 
 matters, not one someone else might have?
</p>
<p> 
 I understand they do not want to be fiddling with answering the phone in the 
 middle of doing something else, and that's if they can actually find it - 
 which leads to one of the difficulties for older people - hearing it ring in 
 the first place! I think many older people find mobile phones intrusive, not 
 helped by (mostly) younger people chatting at full volume on trains and 
 buses! I haven't any experience yet with smart phones, for reasons I will 
 describe shortly.
</p>
<p> 
 Other major positives for older people include remotely controlled burglar 
 alarm systems, alarm systems on a phone to alert someone of health issues, 
 and even for some people, games!
</p>
<p> 
 However, there are problems which get worse the older you get. Here are my 
 main gripes.
</p>
<p> 
 Touch screens are a nice idea but almost impossible to use if you have shaky 
 hands, and most of us do eventually.
</p>
<p> 
 Small devices are a problem as well, as we often can't read the screens. 
 Even this Notebook computer I am using is difficult. It is rarely intuitive 
 finding out how to increase the text size, and then there's no room on the 
 screen without lots of scrolling. I've just found how to do it for this 
 article!
</p>
<p> 
 Passwords and PIN numbers - another problem. We're told not to write them 
 down but to have different ones for each application. I couldn't have 
 remembered them if I'd obeyed this rule years ago, now it is impossible. 
 Quite apart from issues such as failing memory, we now have so many.
</p>
<p> 
 Then there are constantly changing computer operating systems. I read a 
 letter in the Saga magazine just this morning pleading for fewer of these. 
 It nearly always depends on having some younger techie to explain and 
 implement changes, and not all of us have access to such people. Even after 
 a full career in IT I am seriously out of date and have no confidence in 
 being able to deal with this problem. Associated with this is the cost of 
 getting new hardware and software - many older people can't afford to change 
 even if they wanted to.
</p>
<p> 
 Anti-virus systems are an even more complicated example of the above. And a 
 particular irritation is being offered extra features on a trial basis and 
 then not being able to say you don't want them.
</p>
<p> 
 Finally, spam is a nuisance for everyone, but it is counter-intuitive to 
 expect older people to avoid putting details say of their email address on a 
 form when asked to do so. We're much less likely to realise when this is 
 risky. This leads to the issue of scare stories and hoaxes - I always advise 
 my friends to check with Snopes.com before opening anything they don't 
 recognise, and never to download anything they don't know about - but they 
 don't know about software upgrades they need either!
</p>
<p> 
 In conclusion, there's quite a lot of education needed for my generation who 
 mostly had almost no experience of computers in their working lives. But 
 they are not going to do it - they don't see why they should and in any 
 case, it just makes them recognise how little they know and how much can go 
 wrong! And cost again is a factor.
</p>
<p> 
 So, what do we need? Fewer changes; cheaper support networks; clearer 
 instructions on how to increase volume and text size and swap between mouse 
 and touch screen systems; and older people serving in computer shops! And 
 how about bringing back paper copies of manuals- if you don't know how to 
 use your computer, how do you find the help system?

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Sponsored notice: Audio book mysteries to relax and enjoy</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<p> 
 More and more people are using audio books to relax, and to develop and 
 stimulate their imaginations. My name is Donna J. Jodhan and since 2010 I 
 have been using my audio mysteries to help thousands from around the world 
 to do just that - for pennies at a time.
</p>
<p> 
 I am an author who is blind. My audio mystery titles include 'Young, 
 good-looking, and brilliant!' [plot summary follows]:
</p>
<p> 
 Who says that success does not come with a price tag? Especially when there 
 are secrets lurking in the background, and this was Senator Christian 
 Jansen's downfall. There was one who did not want the senator to run as 
 president because he would be too difficult to handle. Another wanted the 
 senator dead for breaking his promise to an oil company. And a Mafia boss 
 who felt that the senator would be dangerous to them as president.
</p>
<p> 
 Who could have done it? [plot summary ends] Other titles include 'The 
 Million Dollar Mansion', 'The Kidnapper's Kid' and many more.
