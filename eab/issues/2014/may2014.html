<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>01: Eu Elections 'Inaccessible For Many Disabled Citizens'</h3>
<p> 
 &quot;Inaccessible and cumbersome administrative processes&quot; including 
 inaccessible websites are preventing people with disabilities in Europe from 
 voting in elections, according to a new report by the European Union Agency 
 for Fundamental Rights (FRA), an EU advisory research body.
</p>
<p> 
 The report, published this month, examined how well the political rights of 
 persons with disabilities are being upheld across Europe, and found 
 significant barriers exist to the exercise of these rights. &quot;Gaps between 
 the promise of law and policy and their actual implementation - for example 
 in the form of inaccessible polling stations or websites - persist&quot;, it 
 says.
</p>
<p> 
 Information on elections remains largely inaccessible to persons with 
 disabilities, the report says, and official voting information websites in 
 most EU member states do not appear to meet the minimum accepted standard 
 for website accessibility, the international Web Content Accessibility 
 Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
</p>
<p> 
 The report can be accessed online. Short link:

 .</p>
<p> 
 In a move linked to publication of the FRA report, the European Disability 
 Forum (EDF) urged EU member states to remove restrictions that were 
 preventing persons with disabilities from voting in the run-up to the recent 
 European Parliament elections.
</p>
<p> 
 The forum, an independent international campaign group, also called on those 
 European citizens with disabilities that were able to vote to do so, and 
 exert their influence. The group published its own policy manifesto, &quot;The 
 key priorities of the disability movement&quot; ( 
 <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/page_generale.asp?docid=33367">http://www.edf-feph.org/page_generale.asp?docid=33367</a>
 ), aimed at political  parties across Europe. These include making goods and services accessible 
 for all, through implementing the proposed EU directive on the accessibility 
 of public websites.

<h3 id="i168-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Joysticks And 3-D Printing Among Election Access Prototypes</h3>
<p> 
 Voting with joysticks and 3-D printed accessible cases for tablet computers 
 housing voting systems are among innovations presented in a new report on 
 making elections more accessible for people with disabilities published this 
 month by the US Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF).
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Innovations for accessible elections&quot; ( 
 <a href="http://www.itif.org/publications/innovations-accessible-elections">http://www.itif.org/publications/innovations-accessible-elections</a>
 ) assesses  several years of ITIF research and development projects.
</p>
<p> 
 US elections make use of a range of electronic voting systems including 
 touch-screen devices and although US law requires accessible alternatives to 
 be offered such as audio, and tactile keys, many voters with disabilities 
 still experience problems using these systems and with voting in general, 
 the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 As many as 47 million US citizens (almost one in four of the voting age 
 population) face barriers to voting in person due to inaccessible devices, 
 it says. Problems include a lack of accessible information about polling 
 place locations; poll workers who do not recognise the needs of people with 
 disabilities; electronic voting systems not set up for audio ballots; and 
 keypads with confusing or unusual layouts and keys that are hard to identify 
 by feel.
</p>
<p> 
 Recent innovation projects by ITIF with partners including the US Election 
 Assistance Commission and the social innovation collaboration platform 
 OpenIDEO have led to a range of ideas and prototypes to try to solve these 
 problems.
</p>
<p> 
 They include a ballot designed for use on any device, codenamed the 
 &quot;Anywhere Ballot&quot;, presenting information in a clear reading order, at the 
 place on the page or screen where the voter is already focused. Other work 
 investigated use of a &quot;smart joystick&quot; as a universal voting control, after 
 testing found the device can help individuals with a wide range of dexterity 
 impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 Following these projects Los Angeles County, the most populous voting area 
 in the US with almost 10 million residents, is using the Anywhere Ballot as 
 the basis of its ballot redesign and is considering including a joystick as 
 the tactile controller, the report says.
</p>
<p> 
 A voting system designed to be navigated using only two buttons with audio 
 prompts, codenamed the &quot;EZ Ballot&quot;, was another winner in an OpenIDEO voting 
 challenge; as was an iPad case with additional accessibility features 
 designed to enhance voting applications, such as tactile switches and a 
 built-in stand to adjust the angle of the screen. The design for the 
 accessible iPad case is now available online (see compressed Zip file at 
 elections.itif.org/wp-content/uploads/ipad-voting-case.zip ) and can be 
 built with a 3D printer, the report says.
</p>
<p> 
 Ideas such as these have shown promising results but with technology and 
 election processes always changing, access work will always need to continue 
 alongside, the report finds.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;While most elections are more accessible today than in years past, more 
 progress is needed... [but] unfortunately, there is no simple solution&quot;, it 
 says. &quot;Creating accessible elections will require sustained research and 
 funding to continue designing new technologies and processes, evaluating 
 them in the field, and training election officials to use them.&quot;
</p>

<h3 id="i168-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Election Access At Heart Of Canadian Disability Law Campaign</h3>
<p> 
 The removal of barriers to voting and elections is among key principles of a 
 new Canadians With Disabilities Act which a group of Canadian disability 
 rights advocates is urging all the country's main political parties to 
 pledge to pass, E-Access Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 The campaign is spearheaded by a group of five leading disability 
 campaigners led by Donna Jodhan, who in 2012 won a six-year legal battle to 
 force the Canadian government to makes its websites more accessible (see 
 E-Access Bulletin September 2013 <a href="http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=932">http://www.headstar.com/eablive/?p=932</a>
 ).  Other members of the &quot;Barrier-free Canada steering committee&quot; are Steven 
 Christianson, advocacy manager at baby health charity March of Dimes; David 
 Lepofsky, a law professor at University of Toronto; Jutta Treviranus, 
 director of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at Ontario College of Art &amp; 
 Design; and Marc Workman of the Canadian national blindness charity CNIB.
</p>
<p> 
 The group is urging all parties to support the principles behind passing a 
 new law ahead of national elections set for October next year. &quot;We believe 
 more work is needed to ensure the rights of Canadians with disabilities 
 remain intact&quot;, Jodhan told E-Access Bulletin this week. &quot;Web accessibility 
 is just one component of our landscape and if we hope to become an equal 
 partner in society then other rights need to be respected and preserved. We 
 need to have equity with the mainstream world.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The group has drawn up a list of 14 principles for the new law, which would 
 echo the US Americans with Disabilities Act.
</p>
<p> 
 These include that it &quot;should require providers... to ensure that their 
 goods, services and facilities are fully usable by persons with 
  disabilities&quot;; that the government of Canada should lead other sectors in 
 achieving the aims of the new law; and that it should provide for a &quot;prompt, 
 independent  and effective process for enforcement&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
 The law should also require the government to review all current and future 
 federal legislation and regulations to identify possible accessibility 
 barriers that they may impose or permit, pass new legislation to address 
 these barriers, the principles state. &quot;As an immediate priority under these 
 activities, the Government of Canada should get input from voters with 
 disabilities on accessibility barriers in election campaigns and the voting 
 process, and should develop reforms to remove and prevent such barriers.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The final principle says: &quot;The Canadians with Disabilities Act must be more 
 than mere window dressing... It must have real force, effect and teeth.&quot;
</p>

<h2><b class="Ps">++</b>Section Two: Q & A- Ken Saunders, AccessFirefox.org .
</h2>
<p class="Goto"><a href="#toc">Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Community Service.</h3>
<p> 
 Ken Saunders is co-owner and founder of AccessFirefox.org, a web portal of 
 accessibility tools and resources for users of the free Firefox web browser. 
 Here, the US-based volunteer answers questions on his work, motivations and 
 passions.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What accessibility tools do you use to facilitate your own work?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I am legally blind due to a congenital condition known as ocular albinism 
 with nystagmus. My visual acuity is documented at 20/200 right eye, 20/400 
 left which means I do have trouble seeing objects both near and far. However 
 my visual acuity can't ever be accurately determined because of nystagmus, 
 which is an involuntary eye movement that causes my eyes to move rapidly in 
 a horizontal direction: side-to-side.
</p>
<p> 
 In terms of the tools I use, I get a lot done using many of the Firefox 
 add-ons I helped develop like Big Buttons, Page Zoom and Font &amp; Theme Size 
 Changer (more on these later). Firefox itself is great because it is so 
 customisable, meaning I can make it fit my needs so it is as comfortable for 
 me to work with as possible.
</p>
<p> 
 There are a lot of free accessibility tools and default accessibility 
 options I rely on like text-to-speech and magnifier applications. There are 
 other more advanced tools out there but when you start to look beyond 
 default accessibility features and free software, your options start to get 
 very costly. I've never really understood why and I would love to see more 
 affordable or free tools out there.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: When and how did you start coding?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I started coding in 2004. I know the basics of HTML, CSS, and some XUL 
 (XML User Interface Language, Mozilla's XML-based language for building user 
 interfaces of applications like Firefox). I'd like to learn JavaScript and 
 I've started to do so, but the visual impairments can get in the way. Most 
 of what I know, I've learned slowly, through teaching myself, experimenting 
 and editing other's work.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: When did you get involved in helping to make Firefox more accessible?
</p>
<p> 
 A: Back in 2005, I downloaded Firefox and clicked on the &quot;Get Involved&quot; 
 button, which was included as a default bookmark within the browser at the 
 time. I soon started volunteering for Spread Firefox (a former website where 
 enthusiasts helped promote Firefox) and eventually became an administrator 
 on that site. Since 2011 when we retired that website, I've become involved 
 in testing as part of Mozilla's quality assurance community, where I've 
 handled testing for Firefox across all platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux and 
 Android).
</p>
<p> 
 I've tried to help out wherever I can by testing and providing feedback for 
 new projects too. One example is the early beginnings of the Mozilla 
 WebMaker project (known as 'Mozilla Drumbeat' at the time). Webmaker is a 
 fresh approach to teaching technology and digital literacy, the goal being 
 to create a new generation of digital creators and webmakers.
</p>
<p> 
 I also spent some time as an Accessibility Steward, which saw me taking on 
 the role of guiding and directing new and potential volunteers interested in 
 contributing to Mozilla's accessibility goals. I'll be picking this 
 responsibility up again soon as I start to help test Firefox OS devices and 
 provide feedback from the perspective of a person with visual impairments.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What is it that you like about Mozilla and Firefox?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I like that Mozilla fights for the rights of Internet users, especially 
 the right to privacy on the web and user sovereignty; the idea that any data 
 relating to an individual belongs to the individual.
</p>
<p> 
 What amazed me and really hit home when I first started volunteering was the 
 sheer volume of like-minded people from all over the world who were coming 
 together to work towards Mozilla's mission and goals; to keep the Web open 
 and accessible to all. The community is very diverse; anyone can contribute, 
 regardless of ability, income, education or background.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: How did Access Firefox come into being?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I co-founded AccessFirefox.org with Otto de Voogd when we were new to 
 Firefox and the various accessibility options that came with it. At the 
 time, the majority of information about these tools and features was spread 
 across several websites, so we wanted to bring them under one roof. So we 
 set about creating the project and the specific accessibility add-ons that 
 come with it.
</p>
<p> 
 Over the years there have been several different contributors to Access 
 Firefox from the Mozilla community. Some have written or contributed to the 
 site's coding, some have created accessibility related add-ons, and many 
 others have supported the site through advocacy.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: What are your favourite Firefox Accessibility add-ons?
</p>
<p> 
 A: Access Firefox accessibility add-ons are slightly different to standard 
 Firefox add-ons. I briefly mentioned my favourites earlier, and I'm proud to 
 have contributed to the development of all three of these: Theme Font &amp; Size 
 Changer, Page Zoom Button and Big Buttons.
</p>
<p> 
 Theme Font &amp; Size Changer is a simple browser tool that lets people change 
 the font size and type in Firefox. It is an especially valuable tool for 
 visually impaired people and wide-screen users. It is different from add-ons 
 that enlarge and reduce font size and type on web pages because it does so 
 in all windows, menus and toolbars within Firefox itself. All font size and 
 font family changes are instantly applied, saved permanently and maintained 
 through sessions.
</p>
<p> 
 Page Zoom Button gives users control of all three page-zoom functions in 
 Firefox from a single button. Users can click on or roll the mouse wheel 
 over the button to zoom in, zoom out and reset a web page back to its 
 default view. Users can also zoom in and out of local offline files such as 
 photos, graphics, and various documents.
</p>
<p> 
 Big Buttons provides large and extra-large Firefox navigation toolbar 
 buttons.
</p>
<p> 
 Q: How would you recommend accessibility users get started with Firefox?
</p>
<p> 
 A: I would recommend starting by taking a look at the features that Firefox 
 offers its users and then download the browser. However, for more detailed 
 information on accessibility add-ons we recommend you take a look at Access 
 Firefox's beginners' guide. Then take your time getting familiar with what's 
 possible. Once you've done that, invest some time in customising Firefox so 
 that it is as comfortable to use as you need it to be.

 Who says that success does not come with a price tag? Especially when there 
 are secrets lurking in the background, and this was Senator Christian 
 Jansen's downfall. There was one who did not want the senator to run as 
 president because he would be too difficult to handle. Another wanted the 
 senator dead for breaking his promise to an oil company. And a Mafia boss 
 who felt that the senator would be dangerous to them as president.
