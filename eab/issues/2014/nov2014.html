<h3 id="i173-02"><b class="Ps">+</b>01: "Embedded Outreach" Key To Digital Inclusion, Conference Hears</h3>
<p> 
 Digital inclusion projects must work with community and voluntary sector 
 bodies if the UK is to ensure people with disabilities engage with the 
 digital world, a national conference has heard.
</p>
<p> 
 The call was made by Jude Palmer, managing director of Digital Outreach, a 
 social enterprise formed in 2007 by three organisations - Community Service 
 Volunteers, Age UK and CEL Group - to run outreach work for the UK's digital 
 TV switchover.
</p>
<p> 
 Research at the time from lead TV switchover body Digital UK found there was 
 a group of about 20% of the population who would not naturally engage with a 
 major mainstream publicity campaign, Palmer told delegates at November's 
 digital inclusion conference hosted by non-profit Tinder Foundation.
</p>
<p> 
 These included older people, people with a disability and those for whom 
 English is not their first language, all of whom can be socially isolated, 
 she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;A lot of people found the switchover daunting, because TV for a lot of 
 people is their main connection out into society&quot;, Palmer said. &quot;They were 
 putting their head in the sand, saying 'it's technical, it's not for me, why 
 do I need to change? I'm perfectly OK as I am'. So a lot of this resonates 
 with why people have not got online yet.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 The key to developing a successful strategy to reaching people in these 
 groups was to work with and through voluntary and community groups who are 
 already interacting with and trusted by them, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 Palmer said the nature of &quot;embedded outreach&quot; was &quot;about people hearing 
 messages from the person they see every week, every day: finding that one 
 person and that one organisation that they do trust and interact with.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We often describe it as 'knitting' - we were able to knit organisations 
 together so you can cut across geographical barriers, social groups. You 
 need to ask - how can you develop relationships with local voluntary and 
 community groups?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Once the right groups have been found, it is important for digital inclusion 
 groups to strike the right balance between passing them consistent materials 
 to fit their own messages, and allowing the trusted intermediaries to remain 
 in control, she said.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;It is about making sure you work consistently with every organisation so 
 key messaging is cascaded down, and people are signposted consistently for 
 where they can get further help.
</p>
<p> 
 But at the same time once you hand over the framework, [you must] leave it 
 to the organisation to deliver that. What we find with embedded outreach is 
 there needs to be an investment from those organisations as well, and that 
 is a really big ask.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 In the course of its work, Digital Outreach was asked to run a trial project 
 in the North West of England to see how its embedded outreach model for 
 digital TV might work for broader digital inclusion, and the results 
 strongly supported the concept, Palmer said.
</p>
<p> 
 Overall, research found that some 77% of people reacted positively to online 
 training if it was led by someone they knew, compared with only 17% reacting 
 positively to a session led by someone they did not know.

<h3 id="i173-03"><b class="Ps">+</b>02: Low-Cost Eye Gaze Tech Shortlisted For Education Award</h3>
<p> 
 A low-cost eye gaze computer controller for schoolchildren is among 
 technologies shortlisted for the 2015 Bett Awards for educational ICT (
</p>
<p> 
 <a href="http://www.bettawards.com">http://www.bettawards.com</a>
 ).</p>
<p> 
 The shortlist was announced this month by i2i Events, organisers of the 
 annual London Bett conference, with the British Educational Suppliers 
 Association (BESA).
</p>
<p> 
 Inclusive EyeGaze Foundations combines myGaze eye tracker hardware from 
 German firm Visual Interaction with Eye Gaze Attention &amp; Looking software 
 from accessible early learning software specialists Inclusive Technology. It 
 is portable, and works with any Windows computer.
</p>
<p> 
 Students can learn to track, fix their gaze and interact with images on 
 screen. The system also allows real-time recording of students' progress, so 
 teachers can review where they looked and for how long using line trace, 
 video and heat maps.
</p>
<p> 
 Sandra Thistlethwaite, specialist speech and language therapist at Inclusive 
 Technology, told E-Access Bulletin the system's cost of just under &pound;1,000 
 was less than a tenth of the average previous cost of similar technologies, 
 opening up new possibilities for eye gaze ICT in schools.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;Traditionally, devices have cost more than &pound;10,000 so they have not been in 
 the reaches of most schools, and you had to go through individual funding 
 streams&quot;, Thistlethwaite said. &quot;So we have been working hard to get units up 
 at a reasonable price that can be afforded by a much wider range of schools 
 and pupils.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We had already identified those with a physical need for eye gaze but this 
 is now giving us the insight into how we interact with and teach pupils with 
 more profound and complex needs, where we are not sure about their cognitive 
 skills, or what they can understand from what they see on screen.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 It is possible that as much as 10%-20% of the UK special school population 
 could experience some benefit from using eye-gaze technology, she said. &quot;I 
 was talking to a special school in the North East this morning with 120 
 pupils which has 20 pupils now using eye gaze and possibly more in the 
 pipeline.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Plans for future developments include more sophisticated learning analytics, 
 with systems that can help users through a learning progression and return 
 more detailed data on their work to teachers and therapists, Thistlethwaite 
 said.
</p>
<p> 
 The seven other finalists in the Bett Awards special educational needs 
 category are the Clicker Books literacy app for primary school children, 
 from Crick Software; ReadingWise English literacy software from IdeasWise; 
 the Dynamo Profiler online dyscalculia assessor from JellyJames Publishing; 
 Forbrain, an auditory feedback headset for speech improvement, from Sound 
 For Life; Read&amp;Write literacy support software from Texthelp; Predictable, a 
 text-based augmentative communication app, from Therapy Box; and Exam Pen, a 
 scanner and assistive reader to help students with reading difficulties such 
 as dyslexia take exams independently, from WizCom Tech.
</p>
<p> 
 Winners will be announced in January 2015.

<h3 id="i173-04"><b class="Ps">+</b>03: Online Resource To Boost Access To Elections And Politics</h3>
<p> 
 An online resource to boost access to elections and politics by people with 
 disabilities is to be launched next month by the International Foundation 
 For Electoral Systems (IFES), a non-profit based in Washington DC, E-Access 
 Bulletin has learned.
</p>
<p> 
 IFES works internationally to promote access to democracy by all groups 
 including people with disabilities, with funding largely from government 
 agencies in the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Its work is aimed at many 
 groups including governments, election management agencies, civil society 
 groups, academics, lawyers, disability groups and people with disabilities.
</p>
<p> 
 The new online resource will be based on an overhaul of the foundation's 
 website ElectionAccess.org (
</p>
<p> 
 www.electionaccess.org ),
</p>
<p> 
 IFES access and inclusion specialist Virginia Atkinson told E-Access 
 Bulletin.
</p>
<p> 
 It will include an introduction to disability rights aimed at election 
 management bodies and observer groups, giving examples of inclusive practice 
 such as accessible voter education
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;In many countries they don't think at all about access to elections for 
 people for disabilities&quot;, Atkinson said. &quot;Or maybe they build a wheelchair 
 ramp, but they don't think about other issues such as accessible voter 
 education, websites or voting machines.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Materials will include good practice examples such as YouTube videos, images 
 or brochures and posters from other countries, as well as excerpts from 
 relevant laws on election access.
</p>
<p> 
 &quot;We are hoping the website will be used as an advocacy tool to create peer 
 pressure, and help change discriminatory laws&quot;, she said. &quot;It will be the 
 only site where all this information is collected in one place.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 Other aspects of the foundation's current disability rights work includes a 
 major project in South East Asia working with international teams of 
 election observers, Atkinson said. &quot;Many observer teams do not include 
 people with disabilities, and then don't include questions relating to 
 disability access in their work&quot;, she said.

<p> 
 - Web accessibility.
</p>
<h3 ><b class="Ps">+</b>07: Embedding Inclusion</h3>
<p> 
 by Jonathan Hassell.
</p>
<p> 
 Most organizations are either oblivious to, or terrified about, web 
 accessibility.
</p>
<p> 
 They are probably aware that up to 20% of their customers - people with 
 disabilities - could be clicking away from their websites, or leaving their 
 mobile apps every day without having bought anything or found the 
 information or service they wished to find.
</p>
<p> 
 They may have even heard from one of this 20%, complaining about problems 
 they can't reproduce, talking about 'assistive technologies' they don't 
 understand, and asking for what seem like impossible fixes.
</p>
<p> 
 They know there is the possibility of being sued if they don't do the right 
 thing, but they don't know how far they need to go to prevent that. So if 
 they do make something 'accessible', it's usually only for one product, or 
 one version of a product.
</p>
<p> 
 If this sounds anything like the place where you work, I have some 
 comforting news: you are not alone.
</p>
<p> 
 I learned directly where I believe most organizations want to be from the 
 heads of diversity and inclusion of the top blue-chip corporations in Europe 
 at a meeting of the Vanguard Network in 2011. Here, the event's chairwoman 
 spent a whole hour asking each of the delegates what one thing would really 
 make a difference to their organization's inclusion practices, if they could 
 achieve it. When delegates were asked to vote for which contribution they 
 felt was the most important, the following was the unanimous choice: &quot;What I 
 want is to strategically embed inclusion into my organization's culture and 
 business-as-usual processes, rather than just doing another inclusion 
 project.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
 I spent much of my time subsequently conveying the following to the people 
 in the room:
</p>
<p> 
 That they could implement a strategy that would allow them to attract and 
 keep that 20% of their audience who are disabled, while not detracting from 
 the user experience of those who aren't.
</p>
<p> 
 That there was a way they could sleep soundly, knowing that they'd done 
 enough to cover their 'accessibility risk', but without costing the earth.
</p>
<p> 
 That, through following a simple, strategic business-aligned framework, they 
 could embed the best practice necessary to consistently achieve these aims 
 throughout their organization.
</p>
<p> 
 And that all of this work could also benefit their organization in their 
 bottom line, as benchmarked analytics show how disabled people's increased 
 use of their sites increases their turnover and profits.
</p>
<p> 
 What did I have that could take them from their position of pain to the 
 place they all wanted to be? The answer is British Standard BS 8878:2010, 
 Web Accessibility - Code of Practice.
</p>
<p> 
 It's not the catchiest title in the world, but BS 8878 opens up in detail 
 the strategies, policies and processes that award-winning, best-of-breed 
 organizations like the BBC, IBM, Vodafone, Opera, BT and Lloyds Banking 
 Group have used to become 'accessibility competent and confident', so that 
 they can be used by any organization, no matter how big or small.
</p>
<p> 
 It does this at a time when the legal imperatives behind accessibility are 
 being strengthened internationally, and when tablet and smartphone vendors 
 are racing to promote accessibility as a key selling point of their 
 handsets. It also does this as we start to enter the massive demographic 
 change that will result in the number of people who need accessibility 
 rocketing up, and the 'missing 20%' become 50%.
</p>
<p> 
 There has never been a better time to get into web accessibility, and people 
 who have implemented BS 8878 are increasingly telling me that incorporating 
 its user-centred inclusive design thinking into their production processes 
 has resulted in not only more accessible websites and apps for disabled 
 people, but better websites and apps for everyone.
</p>
<p> 
 NOTE: Professor Jonathan Hassell has more than 14 years' experience of 
 embedding accessibility within digital production teams in leading companies 
 worldwide, and he wrote the British Standard BS 8878. This article is based
